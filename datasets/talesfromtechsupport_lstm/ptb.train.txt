 so my story starts on what was a normal day taking calls on the front line for a large cable company 
 the job pays well and for the most part the people i deal with are fairly nice to talk to 
 quite often we 'll get calls from <unk> especially in the morning who have <unk> equipment issues such as snow on screen '' or no signal '' on their tv sets connected to our digital equipment 
 now my heart does go out to some of these <unk> because up until recently past few years we would supply straight analog cable to many homes coax direct from wall to tv with <unk> guide 
 however most cities we service nowadays require our digital equipment to receive channels and this has caused a lot of frustration with older people who do n't know how to operate said equipment ie 
 always having your tv set on video '' or hdmi '' to get picture 
 so often times we get customers who are repeat offenders with long ticket <unk> of these types of issues 
 so anyway i get a call from an older gentleman who 's quite bitter and mean right off the bat does n't like that i asked for his address / telephone number to verify the account hates that he has to speak with a machine before reaching an agent etc 
 i have some experience handling these types of customers however this call was going to be a little different 
 i spent over 45 minutes with this guy we 'll call him mr. smith trying to get his tv set connected to the digital box properly so he could receive a picture 
 no luck 
 he was getting clearly frustrated by the whole ordeal and started blaming me for not being able to do my job properly how i was useless etc 
 whatever 
 like i said i 've dealt with this before so i tried my best not to take it personally but eventually i had to ask him if we could book a service tech to the home a courtesy call to get his tv working correctly 
 unfortunately our booking calendar was showing an appointment 3 days out 
 that 's when he dropped this on me : do n't bother sending a goddamn technician because i 'll be dead by then 
 i 'm <unk> and tv is the only thing i have left are you really going to make me wait for a tech '' 
 i instantly felt bad 
 i mean i 've heard every complaint in the book as to why people do n't want to wait for a tech but this one kind of got to me 
 i 'm in my <unk> 's so honestly i ca n't even imagine how it must feel to utter those words 
 so i spoke with my supervisor who said they 'd see if we could get someone out earlier ... but we could n't promise anything 
 so i let mr. smith know and he was predictably not very happy with my answer 
 at that point it almost sounded like he started to cry and went into how he has no family left and no friends that come visit this was after i asked if there was anyone in his building that might be able to help 
 man 
 i felt terrible so i took it upon myself to ask mr. smith if i could pay a visit he lived in a small city over from where i was not very far to drive 
 he was a little shocked i was willing to do this but sounded thankful i was willing to come out and help him personally 
 so i head over get to the residence and meet him - within 30 seconds i had the cable running again simple input change and even brought him a <unk> remote for his set top box to avoid this problem in the future 
 that 's when he started crying 
 he goes into how he has n't actually spoken or really <unk> with anyone for years 
 he gave me a hug and told me how thankful he was that i came out and helped him and told me how sorry he was for being so mean earlier on 
 i said it was no problem and i was happy to help and that was it - i left 
 3 weeks later my supervisor comes to my desk and asks me if i could come speak with her for a bit about an account for mr. smith '' 
 turns out he sent the cable company a letter outlining how thankful he was for helping him with his issue and how it really made an old man happy again for once in a very long time '' 
 the letter was <unk> and put on our front entrance to retail 
 i guess the moral of this story is no matter how nasty someone is to you over the phone sometimes they 're not always a terrible person and just going through a lot 
 i still think about mr. smith occasionally when i get those nasty customers and it makes me feel a little better 
 anyway thanks for reading just thought i 'd share how this one call changed my outlook on life : i witnessed this astounding it meltdown around 2004 in a large academic organization 
 an employee decided to send a broad <unk> about her need for a local apartment 
 she happened to discover and use an all-employees @ org.edu type of email address that included everyone 
 and by everyone '' i mean every employee in a <unk> academic institution 
 everyone from the ceo on down received this lady 's apartment inquiry 
 of course this kicked off the usual round of why am i getting this '' and take me <unk> list '' and omg everyone stop replying '' responses ... each <unk> to all-employees @ org.edu so 30,000 new messages 
 email started to <unk> down as a <unk> messages <unk> into mailboxes 
 it fail # 1 : not necessarily making an all-employees @ org.edu email address - that 's quite reasonable - but <unk> unrestricted access to it rather than configuring the mail server to check the sender and generate one not the ceo = not authorized '' reply 
 that was n't the real problem 
 that incident might 've <unk> down after people stopped responding 
 in a <unk> organization lots of people go on <unk> and some of them let 's say 20 remembered to set their email to <unk> about their absence 
 and the auto-responders responded to the same recipients - including all-employees @ org.edu 
 so every i do n't care about your apartment '' message did n't just generate 30,000 copies of itself ... it also generated 30,000 * 20 = <unk> new messages 
 even the <unk> of apartment messages became drowned out by the volume of i 'll be gone <unk> november '' <unk> 
 that also was n't the real problem which again might have died down all by itself 
 the real problem was that the mail servers were quite <unk> 
 the auto-responders did n't just send one i 'm away '' message : they sent an i 'm away '' message in response to <unk> incoming message ... including the i 'm away '' messages of the other auto-responders 
 the <unk> <unk> converted the entire mail system into an <unk> replication factory of away messages as auto-responders <unk> informed not just every employee but also <unk> <unk> about employee status 
 the email systems melted down 
 everything went offline 
 a <unk> enterprise suddenly had no email for about 24 hours 
 that 's not the end of the story 
 the it staff busied themselves with <unk> out the mailboxes from these millions of messages and <unk> the auto-responders 
 they brought the email system back online and their first order of business was to send out an email explaining the cause of the problem etc 
 and they addressed the notification email to all-employees @ org.edu 
 it fail # 2 : before they sent their email message they had disabled most of the auto-responders - but they missed at least one 
 more specifically : they missed at least <unk> 
 part 1 part 2 part 3 part 4 & gt to : boss @ company & gt from : steve @ client & gt subject : out of office & gt dear sir : & gt i apologize for the inconvenience but i need to request file xyz from you 
 my phone is having trouble <unk> emails however but i can receive the file by facebook message 
 & gt steve jack had been out of the office about twenty minutes when boss forwarded this to me 
 i called him at his desk 
 hey boss 
 i just got the email you forwarded me 
 you need me to send file xyz for you '' 
 yes 
 can you ... can you send people files on facebook '' 
 yes i can 
 but i 'll have to use the computer jack 's been using though 
 it 's the only one that can access facebook '' 
 right right 
 i 'll meet you in my wife 's office '' 
 i hung up the phone and launched a single <unk> file on my desktop 
 it ran its commands and then deleted itself as i walked away 
 * i got to boss wife 's office a few minutes later 
 i smiled to her and boss before crossing to the computer 
 give me a second to bring up facebook and then -- '' i turned the laptop around to face us and boss 's wife reached over moving the mouse 
 the screen <unk> to life 
 boss stared 
 boss wife <unk> 
 a soft <unk> followed by the <unk> of a horse <unk> from the laptop 
 she frantically closed the video window ... revealing a second window underneath it a <unk> search for <unk> places to buy weed near me* '' 
 she closed that one too ... revealing buzzfeed 's <unk> signs you 're over your job* '' 
 as she slammed the laptop shut boss shook his head red and shaking with anger 
 how ... how was that -- i mean i thought -- who was using this computer '' 
 he <unk> 
 boss 's wife shook her head 
 jack was using it about a half-hour ago ... '' as as if on cue jack appeared in the doorway with the <unk> from lunch in a <unk> bag in his hand 
 boss 's back was to him 
 that kind of thing should be blocked '' 
 he yelled at me pointing to the laptop 
 i nodded 
 i agree 
 jack said he needed to use the unrestricted computer for some important projects 
 that 's why he asked you to retrieve the key to my desk last week right '' 
 i pointed to the door with my chin and boss saw jack 
 jack blinked at boss 
 he looked at me 
 he looked at the computer 
 then back to me 
 i could see it dawned on him what was going on 
 <unk> did something to my computer did n't you '' 
 he demanded 
 of course i had 
 i had copied a hidden batch file onto jack 's desktop from a usb drive when i fixed '' his computer the other day 
 a file that would send me his browsing history without remoting into his desktop or alerting him 
 then all it would need would be a remote command which i 'd set off from my own computer 
 the file would then delete itself after launching three web pages as soon as the mouse moved ... three of the most incriminating web pages jack had ever visited on the computer 
 all it needed was a remote command which i 'd set off from my own computer 
 granted it was n't entirely untraceable but the only person who 'd know what to look for was in this room looking with as angry a face i could muster at the awful end user who had become the bane of my existence 
 boss 's wife chimed in 
 she was at least slightly more <unk> than her husband 
 no 
 clickity did n't do anything 
 he just exited the ... you know 
 the <unk> 
 whatever was there must have been what you were ... um ... <unk> <unk> when you rushed out of the office for lunch '' 
 she glared at jack and then addressed boss 
 he must have forgotten to close out the evidence of his <unk> <unk> of company property '' 
 i shook my head solemnly 
 and i trusted you with this unrestricted computer too jack 
 i even gave you your own email address for the company because i thought you 'd be an asset 
 clearly ... clearly i was wrong '' 
 i tried my best to sound hurt 
 boss 's wife nonchalantly picked up the laptop and handed it to me 
 jack i am rather upset that you 'd do something like this 
 i hired you as a favor to your mother 
 and you can be certain she 'll hear about this 
 now go home '' 
 jack stood there shaking 
 he probably had an idea of what i had done but he 'd have no way to prove it 
 but ... he ... i ... '' he pointed at me <unk> 
 get out '' 
 boss yelled 
 jack burst into tears and ran from the room 
 * now as i write this it 's been four weeks since jack was terminated 
 i patched '' the security hole '' from spotify and the interns are listening to music again 
 i did n't give the spare desk key back to the office manager 
 as for jack ... i saw him the other day when he stopped by with his mother 
 he came and knocked on my door 
 um ... clickity '' 
 i looked up and <unk> my eyes 
 what '' 
 i just ... i wanted to say i 'm sorry for ... for saying that stuff and ... acting like i did ... '' i blinked 
 ... and ... um ... now that i 've apologized i was hoping you could tell my mom that i did n't really look up any of that stuff 
 you ... you know you 're the one who did it 
 not me 
 i mean ... '' he took a breath 
 i mean i 've learned my lesson ... so ... '' *seriously 
 * come on clickity 
 she 's made me get another job ... and she cut my <unk> ... come on '' 
 he looked at me pleadingly 
 i almost felt sorry for him 
 almost 
 actually not even almost 
 i shook my head and went back to typing 
 jack continued standing there and after a few long moments i looked at him 
 you can go now '' 
 and then he was gone 
 **edit : ** clarity on my evil plan **edit 2** : wow 
 3 <unk> on one post 
 you guys are the best 
 **edit 3** : wow 
 this story has gotten a total of 20 <unk> : one on part 2 one on part 3 17 here and one in <unk> 
 i am overwhelmed with happiness that you all enjoyed my story this much 
 : part 1 part 2 part 3 part 4 the email was pretty <unk> 
 due to recent reports of <unk> security problems by an intern i have had to temporarily block access to spotify 
 i apologize for the inconvenience '' 
 it got around relatively quickly that jack was the one responsible 
 two of the interns quit 
 they stopped playing music out loud 
 none of them talked to jack 
 he was n't in the intern room for very long anyway 
 about a week after his hire boss 's wife decided to let jack just use her office while she was n't there presumably because he complained about how the interns were all being so very mean to him 
 * day 8. i got an email from jack 
 i 'm having issues accessing buzzfeed '' 
 i did n't even move from my chair emailing back a simple reply : due to management concerns buzzfeed is not allowed per our firewall settings '' 
 his email was immediate 
 please 
 i just want to check some things while i 'm on lunch '' 
 i replied back a simple no '' and went about my day 
 and that was the last i ever heard from jack 
 i 'm kidding 
 *of course it was n't 
 * * day 9. someone had opened my desk 
 see i have a laptop in my desk 
 the laptop is set up to bypass the firewall if we need it like if we need to find a business by looking them up on facebook or read a news article on a <unk> news site 
 it 's common knowledge i have it 
 someone had unlocked my desk and taken the laptop 
 i stormed down to the officer manager 's desk 
 she and i have the only two keys to my desk 
 i told her that my desk had been opened and that a company laptop was missing 
 oh '' 
 she said confused 
 boss came down here and needed the key to your desk '' 
 boss '' 
 i was taken aback 
 i ... alright '' 
 maybe boss needed the laptop for something i told myself 
 but that did n't stop me from going straight to boss wife 's office 
 there sitting at the polished <unk> desk sat jack with my laptop 
 and my desk key next to it 
 i approached 
 jack i need you to give me that back '' 
 jack shook his head 
 i got approval from boss 
 the computer in here was acting funny so i asked if i could use your spare laptop and he said yes '' 
 i was completely stunned 
 so you asked boss to get you the key to my desk -- '' i picked the desk key up and put it in my pocket -- '' then take my laptop and use it for ... '' i looked over the screen 
 two windows docked side by side : facebook and <unk> 
 ... this '' 
 he shifted the laptop so i could n't see the screen and cleared his throat like i was <unk> on his private data 
 thanks 
 you can go now '' 
 *you can go now 
 * *you 
 can 
 go 
 now 
 * nope 
 nope nope nope 
 shit does n't work like this man 
 i felt like i wanted to just slap the child sitting in front of me but i <unk> my hand and took a breath 
 the only laptop with unrestricted internet access was in the hand of a <unk> intern 
 the only laptop with unrestricted access 
 i smiled at jack 
 alright no problem 
 have a good day '' 
 i walked out of the office 
 i had a plan 
 jack was fucking going <unk> 
 **edit** : wow 
 thanks to whoever gave me gold 
 part 1 part 2 part 3 part 4 dude ... your <unk> must be like <unk> '' 
 my friend steve who works for one of my company 's clients heard me ranting about jack while we had a coffee 
 i shook my head 
 i know 
 but what am i gon na do 
 slap him 
 get myself fired '' 
 sounds like it 'd be worth it '' 
 i sighed and took a <unk> sip of my coffee 
 i have a plan though 
 but i need your help '' 
 he <unk> up and then scowled 
 my help 
 oh no 
 i do n't like this guy much but -- '' i 'll put the whole story on reddit if you help me '' 
 he thought about it 
 alright but on one condition : you tell everyone that i am the hero that made your evil plan possible '' 
 and so for the record steve became the hero who made my evil plan possible 
 * day <unk> i got a call from boss 
 clickity i just got a call from jack '' 
 *of course you did 
 * what seems to be the problem boss '' 
 he says you 've made his new computer not work '' 
 i blinked staring at the speaker phone 
 *his* new computer 
 you mean our unrestricted computer that he 's ... using '' 
 yes yes that one '' 
 i could almost see boss lean in to the speakerphone 
 i do n't know what your problem is clickity but jack complains that you 're preventing him from working 
 so i need you to fix his computer now '' 
 click 
 as if on cue or more as if he had been outside the office listening jack appeared at my doorway with the laptop 
 so i need you to undo whatever you did '' 
 he opened the laptop and sat it in front of me on top of my paperwork as if to say *you know ... regardless of whatever you were doing ten seconds ago 
 * i <unk> pulling out a usb drive and plugging it into the laptop 
 i grumbled <unk> as i clicked a few buttons on the laptop and then a few on my computer 
 i unplugged the usb drive and closed the laptop 
 there 
 have a nice day '' 
 jack picked up the laptop and turned for the door 
 you better not screw with me again '' 
 as soon as he was gone i smashed my pencil <unk> with my fist 
 * day <unk> it was the perfect day 
 boss 's wife was in the office so jack was sharing her desk and from the looks of my remote viewer doing absolutely nothing at all 
 i sent out an email 
 & gt to : internemail @ company & gt from : clickity @ company & gt subject : intern appreciation day & gt <unk> interns 
 i just cleared this with the office manager 
 for your hard work i 'm treating you guys to lunch 
 go see the office manager and pick up a local pub and burger joint gift card and have a great day 
 thanks for your hard work 
 a few minutes later the phone rang 
 boss 's wife 's office 
 it this is clickity '' 
 this is jack 
 i just saw all the interns walk out ... what 's going on '' 
 oh it 's intern appreciation day 
 did n't you get the email 
 i sent it to the ... oh '' 
 i sighed 
 i completely forgot to send it to your email because it 's separate 
 yeah all the interns are getting lunch '' 
 thanks for letting me know '' jack said with audible edge to his voice 
 if i had n't called you you would n't have told me at all would you -- '' he 's cut off by a disapproving <unk> '' from boss 's wife 
 i cleared my throat and ignored jack 's <unk> attitude 
 go quick and you can still catch them -- '' fine '' 
 jack hung up the phone 
 i took a few <unk> <unk> and texted <unk> 'm sitting here <unk> in my own juices 
 damn home phone which i keep because the security system uses started ringing at <unk> 
 yes i was asleep goddamn it 
 i do n't get to it quickly enough and the answering machine picks it up and hang up 
 then i hear my mobile phone start ringing downstairs ... must be some kind of family emergency so i make it downstairs in time to hear the home phone start up again 
 i answer still half asleep and half scared that something big has happened 
 & gt me hello '' 
 & gt fof hi dallasitguy this is $ guyyoubarelyknow

 i ca n't get my laptop on my home wireless and i really need to check to make sure my flight is on time ''

 click 
 so ... i 'm up now 
 edit : i called $ otherguy to find out if he gave the guy my home & amp mobile numbers 
 he did - last night about <unk> or so he claims 
 i made it clear to him that he 's officially on my shit list as well 
 i 'm tempted to do a conference call with both of them in the middle of the night every night for the next week but i suppose that would keep me from sleeping as well and therefore be self <unk> 
 hell is other <unk> call comes in a user reports her keyboard is going <unk> it is <unk> '' 
 i take a <unk> down to the office bearing a new replacement keyboard 
 i get there and i begin to make sure that it is indeed a faulty keyboard and not just some <unk> sticking the key down 
 i open up notepad and immediately i am <unk> by ... <unk> ... '' everything seems fine otherwise this keyboard is the same model as the replacement i brought over so relatively new no sticky keys either 
 very well a faulty keyboard it is 
 until ... ... until i move the tower and notice a second wireless keyboard sitting on the side of it laying flat on the floor with a stack of papers and a tissue box sitting atop 
 i pull it out and notice the n barrage has stopped on the screen 
 i press the n key once again and an n is added to the word file 
 exorcism was performed demons were <unk> am now priest 
 part 1 part 2 part 3 part 4 i had been working as a small office 's sysadmin for a little over two months when jack was hired 
 jack was a paid intern whose mother was friends with my boss 's wife 
 jack grew up in the <unk> county in the state where my boss lives and has had everything he ever wanted 
 a sense of <unk> that hung around him like the smell of <unk> socks was the first thing i noticed upon being introduced to him as he went around the office 
 jack this is clickity our erm ... uh ... tech ... guy ... '' my boss introduces me in that way that old bosses who do n't use computers often do 
 jack <unk> his hand 
 oh cool 
 nice to meet ya '' 
 i shake 
 welcome aboard '' 
 jack is very eager to get started doing ... whatever 
 will i get a business email '' 
 as if this is the most interesting thing ever 
 adorable i think 
 eventually yes 
 for the moment though we have a shared email for interns on staff 
 i 'll get you the credentials shortly '' 
 most of the interns use the shared email for a while until getting their own 
 just standard procedure 
 you run the firewall right '' 
 yes '' 
 so you can block and <unk> sites '' 
 yes '' 
 jack 's eager smile is contagious 
 cool 
 nice to meet you '' 
 he waves and the boss and jack leave to go be introduced elsewhere 
 now dear reader you might be wondering why i would call jack the worst end user ever given his <unk> and general smiling demeanor who has some understanding of what a sysadmin is and what a sysadmin does 
 that 's above average when it comes to end users 
 well we 're only getting started here with jack 
 -- the first thing jack did was complain the moment he was out of earshot 
 he apparently explained to the boss that it really would be professional to have his own email given his experience and the fact that he was really more than just an intern 
 see jack knew his shit and that was that if he complained to mother she would complain to <unk> who would complain to boss 
 and boss figuring an email is a small thing to ask for had a request to set up a personalized email account for jack on my desk within the hour 
 this was not to be a good start of a relationship with one 's it guy 
 -- day 2 i got an it ticket for the room where the interns work 
 it 's a large open office with a bunch of computers and printers where the interns print stuff all day long 
 because it 's such <unk> work they tend to play music off of pandora or spotify in there 
 the ticket says : from internemail @ <unk> : hey we 're having issues with spotify 
 not super important but please help if you 're free 
 thanks '' aw those guys are always nice to me 
 maybe it 's because i leave reddit unblocked on our firewall so they can reddit at lunch 
 an hour or so later i have a few free minutes and i head down 
 i check out spotify and find the issue and fix it 
 jack is there and watches closely 
 we can use spotify here '' 
 he asks 
 yep '' i reply 
 pandora works too '' another intern adds 
 everything checks out and i leave the <unk> interns and jack 
 -- a couple hours later i got a note on my desk 
 see boss knew i allowed people to play music and such at the office 
 he believed was that spotify is a huge security risk leaving holes in our firewall through which everything from viruses to malware to <unk> could come through 
 boss was unhappy that i would allow such a threat to exist in our system and ordered me to close it up 
 i called boss 
 when i asked who told him these incorrect things about spotify 
 oh jack did of course 
 i explained that spotify was not a threat and that jack was simply mistaken 
 jack however was on the other end of the line in boss 's office on speakerphone and interjected : dude it 's alright if you did n't know about the security issue 
 but do n't try and make me look bad for your mistake '' 
 i 'm stunned as boss hangs up the phone after demanding i fix it 
 **edit : ** <unk> is a second hand story told to me 20 years ago by someone who was already a veteran sysadmin back then so it could have happened in the 80s or early 90s 
 the scene is a factory making heavy machinery 
 they are modern and the factory floor had terminals connected to a mainframe for tracking parts and whatever else they needed it for 
 one day a sysadmin gets a call from the factory floor and after the usual pleasantries the user says : & gt i ca n't log in when i stand up 
 the sysadmin thinks that it 's one of those calls again and goes through the usual : & gt is the power on 
 what do you see on the terminal 
 have you forgotten your password 
 the user interrupts : & gt i know what i 'm doing when i sit down i can log in and everything works but i ca n't log in when i stand up 
 the sysadmin tries to explain that there can be no possible connection between the chair and the terminal and sitting or standing should in no way affect the ability to log in 
 after a long back and forth on the phone he finally gives up and walks to the factory floor to show the user that standing ca n't affect logging in 
 the sysadmin sits down at the terminal gets the password from the user logs in and everything is fine 
 turns to the user and says : & gt see 
 it works your password is fine 
 the user answers : & gt yeah told you now log out stand up and try again 
 the sysadmin <unk> logs out stands up types the password and : *invalid password* 
 ok that 's just bad luck 
 he tries again : *invalid password* 
 and again : *invalid password* 
 baffled by this the sysadmin tries his own mainframe account standing : *invalid password* 
 he sits down and manages to log in just fine 
 this has now turned from crazy user to a really <unk> debugging problem 
 the word <unk> about the terminal with the chair as an input device and other people start <unk> around it 
 those are technical people in a relatively high tech factory they are all interested in fun debugging 
 production <unk> to a halt 
 everyone wants to try if they are affected it turns out that most people can log in just fine but there are certain people who ca n't log in standing and there are quite a few who ca n't log in regardless of standing or sitting 
 after a long debugging session they find it 
 turns out that some <unk> pulled out two keys from the keyboard and switched their places 
 both the user and the sysadmin had one of those letters in the password 
 they were both relatively good at typing and did n't look down at the keyboard when typing when sitting 
 but typing when standing is something they were n't used to and had to look down at the keyboard which made them press the wrong keys 
 some users could n't type properly and never managed to log in 
 while others did n't have those letters in their passwords and the switched keys did n't bother them at all 
 **edit : this post has received a tremendous amount of attention which is awesome 
 and while i certainly appreciate all of the gold please consider instead making a small or large 
 <unk> to a local battered woman 's shelter they could use your support and money way more than i do 
 if you make such a <unk> and pm me proof with your important bits <unk> out i will match those <unk> up to the first $ 100 raised 
 ** after reading this tale by <unk> it brought back memories of a client of my own that was paranoid and rightly so as an aside <unk> we are totally making pars a thing around here 
 as a bit of backstory i spent five years doing it consulting in a rural town about an hour from <unk> or 
 i worked for a small company with a few other consultants and a couple of bench techs 
 my job was primarily <unk> <unk> but having done my time as a front-line tech i 'd periodically involve myself in the more <unk> cases we 'd see from our <unk> customers 
 one day we had a woman come in 
 she caught my eye because she was in her late <unk> or early <unk> and actually quite attractive 
 she had short <unk> blonde hair and bright red lips and was dressed and <unk> like she was <unk> right out of a 1950 's era <unk> ad 
 one of our bench techs greets her and starts talking to her 
 right out the gate i can tell she is panicked and by the sound of it <unk> hat levels of crazy 
 shit there goes any desire i had to flirt with her and maybe see if i could buy her a drink 
 i listen in on the conversation anyways because it 's at least a change of pace from the monotony of my day-to-day 
 after a few minutes of her going on about how her husband is <unk> on her through all manner of devices my bench tech looks back at me with a <unk> look on his face 
 i oblige as i appreciated that the front-line guys respected me enough to ask for my help on these things 
 i walked up front introduced myself as the supervisor and told her that since her issue was so unique and serious it 'd probably be best if our more senior staff handled it 
 now that i was seeing her up close i could tell that under her <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> was a deeply distraught woman 
 her eyes looked <unk> and tired 
 like she had been up too late crying 
 obviously at this point i 'm just playing along 
 this is n't my first <unk> and generally what happens is the client claims some individual or three letter agency is monitoring their computer we tell them our hourly rate for forensics $ 150 an hour and suddenly the <unk> watching them are n't that big of a deal anymore 
 now to be fair we actually *did* <unk> in computer forensics and data recovery working extensively with the local police department and a handful of legal firms on a number of cases where they needed expert help we even had a guy on staff full-time who wore that hat most days 
 the local police were pretty <unk> and <unk> out at least some of their computer crime related work to us on contract 
 in the cases where people *did* want to pay we would do our due diligence and prepare a professional report of our findings accordingly 
 we would meet with <unk> and testify in court as necessary 
 generally it was fairly benign stuff like gathering chat logs and browser history for a divorce <unk> where one <unk> accused the other of cheating or something similar and wanted evidence to back that up 
 back to the client at hand 
 she insists her husband is monitoring her every move tracking her vehicle monitoring her computer and recording her in her own home 
 here 's where it gets interesting : she claims that she <unk> all of this because he has told her about it 
 in fact he has gone so far as to threaten her life if she tries to <unk> with any of it 
 she says she has tried to apply for a protective order against him but <unk> without some sort of evidence of his behavior nobody would take her seriously 
 i give her the crazy <unk> test and i tell her that in order to gather evidence discreetly we would need two of our senior consultants to investigate 
 $ 300 an hour four hour minimum 
 she pulls out her wallet 
 fuck she 's serious 
 we agree to start with her vehicle to check for signs of the gps tracker 
 she says she is parked several blocks away so her husband wo n't know she came to a computer store we were in a downtown area surrounded by retail stores 
 so i grab my <unk> and <unk> at one of my colleagues who has been tuned in himself from his back office desk to join me 
 so the lady myself my colleague and both of our now intensely curious bench techs all of us in matching company <unk> follow this lady down the street to her car 
 what a <unk> crew we must have been 
 we get to her <unk> begin our process of looking for this gps device 
 now gps <unk> at least the commercially available ones require two things generally : dedicated <unk> power and an <unk> at least by metal view of the sky 
 they basically use gps to grab the <unk> and then a <unk> cellular signal to relay the <unk> data to a web interface or something 
 so there really are n't that many places they can really be mounted that are both effective and discreet 
 we spend some time looking around the <unk> <unk> panels and even bits of the <unk> 
 battery does n't have any additional leads running off of it fuse box is n't tapped anywhere for power 
 nothing 
 just as i 'm starting to lose faith that this may not be quite as exciting as i had perhaps hoped i find the fucking thing 
 it was tiny not much bigger than a flash drive and mounted behind the front <unk> 
 it looked pretty much exactly like this the reason it did n't need <unk> power is that it was n't an active device 
 this device did not provide <unk> tracking rather it used some internal memory and a couple <unk> batteries to log gps data for days at a time 
 at some point when the van was not in use the guy would grab the gps device upload the data to his laptop maybe swap batteries then <unk> it to the car 
 fucking hell this lady was very much indeed paranoid and rightfully so 
 now that we 've established that she is n't batshit insane but that she actually *is* being tracked by her husband the tone amongst our team became <unk> more serious 
 obviously something <unk> is going on and we are n't sure what but by the sound of things this lady really is fearful of her life 
 she has entrusted *us* to gather evidence and help her get a protective order against him which is something i think all of us took quite seriously 
 we show her the tracker and she breaks down into tears because it 's the first evidence she has physically seen 
 we take photos of it and carefully install it back where it belongs 
 i sort of assumed that a gps tracker on your fucking car would be proof enough for a judge to issue at least a temporary protective order but she seemed <unk> that she would need more evidence to make it stick 
 our next moves have to be <unk> very deliberately 
 she claims that her home is bugged and so is her computer 
 we will need to go onsite to investigate accordingly but it will have to be at a time when both her husband is n't home and when we will be able to quickly create a report for her leaving her enough time to get a protective order before the day 's end 
 we could n't chance him coming home later reviewing whatever it was he was recording and finding out that she had taken action to have him investigated 
 it was n't going to be for at least a week before there was a time that was just right 
 we made arrangements with her back at the office and i offered to walk her back to her car 
 she accepted and on the way she <unk> in me many of the personal details of her life and her obviously abusive relationship with her husband 
 in the interest of protecting her privacy i 'll simply say that it sounded like she finally figured out how <unk> he was and when she said she wanted out he was n't about to let that happen 
 i asked her again if she really was afraid for her life and the sincerity of her yes '' was both scary and <unk> for me 
 i asked her if she had thought about getting a gun and she said she had but that he would notice the large sum of money needed to purchase one missing from their joint account 
 as the <unk> of the situation weighed on me i offered to let her borrow one of mine 
 she was <unk> but i assured her that it was completely okay 
 at the time i had several <unk> and <unk> and i could n't think of a more appropriate situation for someone to have one 
 my car was parked close by and we walked over to it 
 i tried to gather some idea of her familiarity with <unk> as the thought of giving one to more or less a complete stranger especially one that might not know what to do with it was unsettling to me 
 it sounded like she had at least a basic understanding of their function had gone shooting before etc 
 in my mind the pros of her having at least some means to protect herself <unk> the cons so i moved forward 
 in the <unk> i had a <unk> lcp which is a very small <unk> <unk> handgun that i kept in my get home <unk> <unk> kit 
 it was fitted with the factory installed crimson trace laser grips which i had dialed in to about 10 meters 
 we went over the basics of how to use it safely i showed her how the laser worked and told her that for her situation all she had to know was that the bullet would go more or less where the red dot of the laser was 
 she was crying and frankly at this point i pretty much was too 
 i gave her my cell phone number and told her to call me if she needed someone to talk to 
 we <unk> for a while before parting ways 
 it was n't a romantic hug or anything it was that kind of hug that 's exchanged when someone <unk> to be <unk> 
 like when your best mate tells you his mom passed away or something 
 she needed the comfort of knowing that she was n't alone that at least one person took her seriously and i 'd like to think that i gave her some hope that things would be <unk> 
 the next week was <unk> as we prepared for our investigation 
 my coworkers and i spent considerable time discussing and researching ways to <unk> her computer to look for evidence as well as how to approach the search of the house 
 when the day finally came we arrived onsite at the specified time armed with our forensics tools <unk> laptops ... anything we might need 
 i set to work immediately on her computers a home desktop and a personal laptop while two of my colleagues began their search of the house 
 i removed the drives from her pcs and using a usb <unk> which physically prevented me from <unk> any information on her drives i made a clone of both drives 
 for the sake of speed both drives were cloned to ssds 
 once cloned i put the pcs back they way they were and began mounting the cloned volumes and investigating 
 the drives were mounted into a <unk> vm with no wlan access 
 scanning the drives with a number of <unk> programs did n't turn anything up 
 looking through the file system however paying special attention to hidden files and protected system files turned up some things that did n't look quite right filenames and directories that looked obfuscated 
 i made the call to boot up both pcs off of the cloned ssds and look that them live to see if maybe i could catch an obfuscated process running or something 
 nothing 
 with nothing else open i ran a <unk> <unk> out of cmd 
 there were a handful of <unk> connections active 
 one by one i started performing dns <unk> on the ips 
 everything was normal active connections for background processes like skype 
 then i found it 
 an active connection to a clearly obfuscated domain name 
 it looked like a license key with a <unk> at the end of it 
 something like <unk> 
 it was hiding in plain sight and it was registered to <unk> corporation 
 guess what they sell 
 yup 
 surveillance software 
 the pc was running something called <unk> pro which was capable of monitoring all of the users activities browsing history keylogging even sending remote screen <unk> to a mobile phone or email based on target keywords 
 it was the full nine <unk> for monitoring 
 i screen capped everything for my logs shut the system down and swapped the forensic ssds for the original disks to put everything back the way it was 
 not too long after our other two guys found some evidence of their own 
 two separate and frankly rather rudimentary cmos cameras hidden in the master <unk> 
 one in the closet in a <unk> one in the smoke detector in the ceiling 
 both if i recall correctly were simply wired to <unk> batteries and recorded to sd cards 
 all things considered they were pretty low tech 
 the contents of the memory cards would have had to be moved off at least once a day and the battery probably changed at least as often 
 we did n't touch anything 
 lots of <unk> were taken 
 we went back to the office and <unk> all of the evidence into a document for her and i passed the disk images onto our forensics guy for further evaluation 
 i met with the client later that day to present her the report so she could furnish it to the court 
 the <unk> she had for us was absolutely <unk> 
 we did n't charge her for our services 
 getting to play a role in stopping her sick fuck of a husband from <unk> in whatever it is he was doing was payment enough 
 i 'd like to tell you that i know how this story ends 
 i 'd like to say that the guy was put away in jail forever and my <unk> it prowess and <unk> <unk> her into my arms and we lived happily ever after 
 but frankly i do n't really know what happened 
 what i *can* tell you that about a week after we gave her our report i met her for coffee at a place across the street 
 she looked visibly better 
 her <unk> tired eyes were gone replaced instead by ones that seemed to <unk> with <unk> 
 her skin was <unk> and beautiful 
 she was smiling for the first time i 'd seen 
 an <unk> weight had been lifted off of her and it showed 
 she told me that she was temporarily living with her mom and dad that a <unk> order was in place on her <unk> husband and that she was finally filing for divorce 
 she told me that for the first time in a very long time she felt safe and that she felt happy 
 in the parking lot she gave me back the little handgun profusely thanking me again for the work we did 
 she <unk> me both of us teary-eyed and we parted ways 
 for me it proved to be one of the most <unk> <unk> experiences of my career 
 edit : thank you to everyone who 's gilded this post 
 it 's definitely put a smile on my <unk> mom is sweet but she has this notion she should n't bother me unless its important 
 my phone rang last week while i was home 
 day off 
 & gt mom : do you have a minute honey 
 my internet does n't work either computer nor the tablet <unk> i was thinking maybe you could come have dinner later and look at it 
 i bought chicken soft cheese <unk> and i 'm <unk> <unk> '' somewhere later down the menu i already fixed it 
 i work at the telco and have access to my tools remotely i saw it had no valid ip so i reset the modem and the router we provide her 
 basic lease renewal issue 
 it happens everything else is green 
 & gt bytewave : boom magic you 're online mom '' 
 & gt mom : <unk> 
 ... oh 
 you 're right '' 
 <unk> disappointed 
 * thank you that was really fast i guess i wo n't trouble you to come over then '' 
 ... clearly she was more excited at the prospect of the meal than the free tech support but for her it seems something broken or a holiday is required to <unk> me to hang out 
 & gt bytewave : hey hey there i was promised a home cooked meal here 
 i 'm happy to come anyway '' 
 & gt mom : <unk> that 's fine its nice of you to be polite 
 but i know you 're busy you do n't have to 
 we can do this another time '' 
 okay let 's do this the easy way 
 reach back to the tools <unk> the router 
 & gt bytewave : there its broken again mom 
 and it 'll stay that way till <unk> '' 
 & gt mom : oh 
 lovely then shall we say 6 o'clock '' 
 <unk> ... all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 i have been working my way up the food chain at the little it company i 'm with 
 the clients i deal with i treat much like i did customers at starbucks 
 <unk> caring <unk> blah blah good customer service blah blah 
 and this has put me in good favor with all of our clients that i 've dealt with 
 one in particular is a <unk> regional company that <unk> in giving <unk> a lucrative opportunity to <unk> people less strong <unk> than them 
 i 'll let you determine the field 
 they are not my primary station '' but i help out there when the ticket queue gets overloaded 
 we can call them slimeco 
 most of the folks there that i deal with while slimy in general are quite pleasant towards me 
 i 'm the cheerful guy with the laptop who does n't make promises and just does what needs to be done unlike the three other <unk> techs stationed there who make hard deadlines they never meet 
 but there is one woman here who is beyond help 
 ever see that episode of kitchen nightmares or whatever it was that had the husband and wife pair that the wife was just completely convinced she could do no wrong and that everyone was out to get her 
 that 's this woman 
 not literally but a <unk> duplicate 
 she is a problem for everyone and my pleasant demeanor does n't mean shit to her because i 'm just trying to ruin her life 
 i avoid her like the plague because i have more important things to deal with than her fifteen tickets about the same goddamn bullshit that has been resolved over and over again 
 we 'll just call her the.harpy from here on out 
 this past saturday the fourth i 'm up at my friends <unk> for the long weekend when i get a call from a number i do n't recognize 
 i answer because at 2am it could be important 
 something could be wrong at home or with my family or what have you 
 & gt me <unk> uh ... hello '' 
 & gt the.harpy finally someone fucking answers 
 are n't you guys on call or whatever '' 
 & gt me i 'm sorry who is this '' 
 & gt t.h who the fuck do you think it is 
 it 's the.harpy from slimeco 
 my goddamn laptop keeps restarting '' 
 & gt me how did you get this number '' 
 & gt t.h why does that fucking matter 
 you 're it 
 you 're on call 
 that 's how it works 
 fix my fucking laptop or i 'll have your job '' 
 & gt me this is a personal cell phone and i 'm not on call ever 
 we do n't have <unk> support '' 
 & gt t.h if i can get a hold of you you 're on call 
 and this laptop you gave me is n't working 
 it keeps restarting and i need it to do my fucking job '' 
 & gt me i 'm 200 miles away i have no internet access so i could n't remote in if i wanted to and it 's a holiday weekend 
 slimeco 
 is closed until tuesday '' 
 & gt t.h well i work off hours and i have work that needs to get done so get in your fucking car and find some internet and fix my fucking laptop '' & gt me i 'm sorry 
 there 's nothing i can do 
 i 'm not going out looking for an internet connection at 2 in the morning on a holiday weekend just because you decided you need to work right this second 
 i 'm not even a dedicated slimeco 
 technician 
 i 'm only there when support is needed and i have n't been in the branch since last week '' 
 & gt t.h i do n't give a <unk> you work for us and you will fix my laptop right now 
 i do n't care if you have to drive all the way here to do it '' 
 & gt me you know what you 're right 
 i just need you to submit a ticket so i can get to it in the system and i 'll head right over to the nearest starbucks '' 
 & gt t.h that 's what i fucking thought 
 you know i should n't have to jump through these kind of <unk> to get shit done around here 
 you should just be grateful you have a job at all you fucking <unk> '' & gt me yep 
 you 're right 
 go ahead and place the ticket and i 'll head right on over to starbucks and remote in and get this all taken care of for you right away '' 
 & gt t.h good '' 
 she hangs up 
 i immediately put my phone on silent 
 my laptop is sitting <unk> in it 's docking station back at the main office 200 miles away the nearest starbucks is about 40 miles away and i go back to bed about ten feet away 
 i check my phone in the morning 
 <unk> missed calls 
 14 voicemails 
 two hundred and <unk> emails 
 <unk> between personal attacks fired off like text messages and submitted tickets 
 funny how her laptop was stable long enough to submit around fifty tickets and another <unk> emails 
 i blocked her number after that 
 i got into work today and my boss had a similar situation 
 she kept calling his phone long into the night 
 & gt boss you 're nicer than i was 
 i just told her to enjoy her holiday weekend and hung up '' 
 *i wonder if starbucks is still <unk> <unk> update : slimeco brought in the lawyers and the excrement hit the fan 
 *** my boss spoke with upper management yesterday and today when i came into that office as i normally do on wednesday i was immediately escorted to the board room by two security guards 
 the president cfo chairman of the board slimeco 's lawyer our it firm 's lawyer and my boss were all at the table 
 i found out my boss had threatened to file a proper criminal suit as a result of t.h 's behavior on my behalf 
 it was explained to my boss and i that t.h while an obvious problem is a high-earner for the company and they would not fire her 
 however it was discovered through an internal investigation that she had in fact gotten the numbers of all of the techs out of the cfo 's blackberry 
 we do n't know how she got into the blackberry but what we do know is that the cfo left his blackberry unattended which is a serious security compromise and also a violation of the contract between the company and my it firm 
 some very strong words were exchanged between slimeco 's officials and my boss 
 the lawyers agreed that it was in fact a serious breach of contract leaving any data available to unauthorized users and it was made clear that the contract in place would be terminated at the end of the meeting 
 it was later explained to me that given the nature of the breach we 'd basically have an all hands on deck '' situation where every available tech would report to slimeco and start pulling servers switches and any other <unk> equipment 
 estimated time of dismantlement was about two and a half hours 
 there was also the phrase wood chipper for hard drives '' thrown in there 
 i do n't know if this was literal or a figure of speech 
 for the next two hours i was not allowed to leave the room 
 my boss his lawyer and slimeco renegotiated the contract on the spot 
 a 36 % price hike increased security improvements and a couple other things that went right over my head 
 the lawyer then pointed out that i was still well within my rights to and asked if i would be seeking legal action 
 i asked what my options were 
 before he even got it out of his mouth slimeco started talking about a settlement '' to keep me from going any further 
 without going into too many specifics there a check was cut and immediately cashed because they ai n't gon na play me for no fool the.harpy was put on an actual probation my boss gave me the rest of the week off — billed to slimeco — so i can have an actual vacation and i 'm no longer going to do any service at slimeco 
 not the outcome i expected at <unk> story is pretty much almost 5 years old but i want to vent it out it 's been causing me grief and i just need it to share it to finally feel calm 
 as you may remember i live in mexico and things are not exactly pretty thankfully i know how to watch my back and do n't make enemies but sometimes <unk> catches up with you 
 i had finished my training and got a <unk> that allowed me to work on a computer store and repair computers arrived early everything normal until <unk> guy comes in wants his hdd wiped clean and a brand new copy of windows 7. i did n't ask many questions just took it to the back and started working on it gave the case a nice cleaning and removed the dust boot it up then <unk> hit the fan 
 i hear from the front how the front glass breaks and people started yelling my boss and the man to get the f*ck down as well lots of insults to the client before i could react someone comes to where i was pointing an <unk> <unk> <unk> at me i jump to the floor eating that dirt and holding my hands on the back of my neck avoiding any eye contact & gt $ t : what did you do to that computer 
 & gt $ me : nothing 
 i did n't get to touch it 
 i was just cleaning it 
 & gt $ t : lies <unk> 
 & gt $ me : check it yourself everything is <unk> 
 i could feel the <unk> pointed <unk> me i heard someone else come in and take the pc away it felt like hours until they decided to <unk> back and run away 
 once i recovered from the shock i stand up and head to the front my boss was on the phone crying <unk> i did n't even hear the police <unk> then i noticed the client was missing 
 i was not allowed to see the security footage but the client was taken away he was identified as a <unk> member body discovered hours later 
 if it was n't because i needed the money i would have quit <unk> <unk> me avoiding eye contact probably saved my life 
 edit : i see many people doubt it it 's fine with me but i 'm going to clarify a few things 
 & gt everyone speaks in spanish i simply translated it into <unk> for style 
 & gt i live in a dangerous city hence why i watch my back 
 & gt i never learned what was in that hdd i 'm better not knowing 
 this happened a while back but it 's still the best thing that ever happened to me at work 
 true story 
 so i was hired by a big defense company upgrade <unk> <unk> weapons etc with over <unk> employees 
 you can imagine this was a very big company 
 we were in building 34 and if you needed to go somewhere quick you took a bike or an electric car 
 i usually did 2nd line support but they had a couple of people call in sick and asked me to do first line support 
 it was a friday and not much was happening besides the usual <unk> and tech guys turning off unix machines that needed a <unk> command with admin rights 
 the phone rings 
 & gt yes hello this the secretary of the ceo 
 we need you to come over now 
 we have a big problem 
 & gt me : what seems to be wrong 
 & gt her : mr ceo is trying to open a file in word but everytime he does this scrambled text is showing up 
 i think we are being hacked 
 this was a big issue since a couple of weeks before this a group of <unk> broke into the company and climbed on top of our radar tower & gt me : i 'll take a look from here and take over your screen 
 hang on 
 so i take over his screen this is what happens : file open : jkahsfhjkhjhjjjjjjfjjjjjsakkkalalllallallalallal*uuu**jjjdkjkjaslklkssssssssssssss & gt her : i do n't know what this is 
 you see 
 this is so weird ... now i knew what was wrong at this moment but i wanted to see in person 
 you do n't just walk into the exec office every day 
 & gt me : <unk> 
 i 'll be there as soon as possible 
 so i grab this electric car drive over and 5 minutes later i walk into the executive building 
 a very nice building totally different from the rest of the offices 
 they even had their own dining room and bar 
 the security guy sees me coming and waves me through he was informed of my coming and understood the importance 
 i get out of the elevator at the top floor and am greeted by the secretary a manager and some other <unk> all a bit panicked 
 & gt come over have a look at this 
 the ceo <unk> he shows me : file open : jkahsfhjkhjhjjjjjjfjjjjjsakkkalalllallallalallal*uuu**jjjdkjkjaslklkssssssssssssss so i look at him 
 i look at every single person in that room 
 you could feel the suspense 
 i look back at the computer 
 i pick up the newspaper that was on top of the keyboard and ask : & gt try again please 
 the looks on their face : priceless 
 got a free lunch with the ceo <unk> <unk> case you did n't see the edit on the other post it was suggested i post a <unk> <unk> my boss spoke with upper management yesterday and when i came into that office today as i normally do on wednesday i was immediately escorted to the board room by two security guards 
 the president cfo chairman of the board slimeco 's lawyer our it firm 's lawyer and my boss were all at the table

 not the outcome i expected at <unk> tale from the other side - my friend bought a netflix box for a tv and when it would n't work asked me to come set it up 
 i could n't get there until after work and when i did it was working 
 she said she called google to fix it it was not a google product nor does it use any google services so i thought she googled the company number and had them fix it 
 i wanted to show her it was n't google she called so i checked the caller id 
 it was google 
 after a while on the phone a google <unk> support guy helped her set up an unrelated product for free 
 i guess google really is a helpful service 
 tl dr girl wants a cable box set up but is attacked by <unk> while eating <unk> 
 you don’t do any work on friday in it 
 if it goes wrong you’ll be there all weekend fixing it 
 so in the spirit of being careful friday afternoon drinks were a tradition 
 4pm friday was beer o’clock and as the resident <unk> responsibility for arranging the drinks fell to me 
 no big deal right 
 except that this was the day that i finally got an unlimited account with the local liquor store that would be billed to the company automatically 
 i wasn’t going to waste it 
 i did not waste it 
 our small <unk> company got <unk> drunk 
 like <unk> for being outside in this <unk> drunk 
 there was jack <unk> cans <unk> to the ceiling 
 chips had fallen liberally to the floor 
 someone couldn’t find a bin and filed a chicken wing in the file cabinet under <unk> for chicken 
 it was one of <unk> drinking sessions where everyone is just a total mess 
 around 9pm after five solid hours of <unk> <unk> we broke off and headed into the night 
 i wandered down to a nearby bar and watched some bands play for an hour downed another jug of beer and smiled to myself that the week had ended 
 fate it seems is not without a sense of irony 
 my phone buzzed in my pocket 
 i ran outside <unk> up the stairs as i went managed to <unk> myself against a <unk> and answered 
 it was the ceo 
 the primary and secondary route servers were down 
 i stood frozen in time for an instant the same way a deer looks at the headlights of an oncoming car and then asked him to repeat himself 
 & gt ceo : yes both the route servers are down the entire state is offline get in there now fix it do whatever it takes i can not stress enough that these two servers were the most important thing our company had 
 they in and of themselves were the primary thing around which our business existed and all other things were secondary to them 
 my state was by far the biggest with some of the biggest isps and content providers in the country attached 
 and this was the first full network outage we’d ever had 
 and it was my problem 
 and i’d <unk> enough alcohol that my blood could have been used as a fire <unk> 
 i yelled .. something and ran off in the direction of work 
 it was only when i bumped into the glass front doors before they opened that i started to realise how drunk i was 
 when the elevator arrived at my floor and i bumped into both sides of the hallway before making it to the door i knew i was in trouble 
 that hallway was only 20 feet long 
 but it didn’t matter 
 my wallet hit the card reader 
 i’d made it 
 <unk> a funny thing 
 you get so used to the noises clicks beeps and responses that you realise <unk> wrong in an instant 
 there was no response from the card reader 
 an error surely 
 interference something new in my wallet 
 i dug the card out throwing my wallet on the ground and <unk> it on its own 
 nothing 
 not an <unk> <unk> six beeps or a <unk> format <unk> five beeps 
 nothing 
 the lights were on but no-one was home 
 a few feet away the keypad for the alarm was lit up like a <unk> convention 
 all the lights were on the screen totally <unk> out 
 no beeps for <unk> 
 just .. nothing 
 the blood drained from my face 
 the route servers were inside suffering some unknown fate our customers probably getting more furious by the minute and i <unk> not open the <unk> 
 again 
 no sod it 
 i wasn’t taking any more of this security <unk> crap 
 i was getting into this datacentre security system be damned 
 you all know what i’d tried before and i knew as well so i didn’t bother trying again 
 my tools once again were behind the locked door and then the light went on over my head 
 & gt chhopsky : i can’t .. go through the door … i can’t .. go around the door .. i can’t go .. under it … 
 but can i go over it 
 this is the logic of a drunk engineer try all the <unk> 
 there was a chair that we left outside for people working outside the dc so in my infinite wisdom i dragged the chair over to the wall and lifted a ceiling tile 
 unlike the dc where the ceiling tiles were weighed down with hundreds of heavy cables the office was free and clear 
 and the wall itself stopped at the ceiling 
 so pushing the tile into the cavity between the suspended ceiling and the concrete i <unk> myself up into the ceiling 
 this did not work as well as i’d hoped because i was not very strong 
 i kicked and pushed off the wall scrambling to push myself up onto what i now realised was a very thin wall 
 for those not familiar with a suspended ceiling metal rods are drilled into the concrete block above and a grid pattern hangs below it 
 inside those <unk> are weak light tiles basically made of a combination of cardboard and <unk> 
 looking at the predicament i’d gotten myself into it became apparent that the only things that were going to support my weight up here were the <unk> into the concrete 
 so i’d hold onto the rods with my hands and lying prone in the ceiling distribute the rest of my weight along the horizontal connectors 
 i’d drop down onto the file cabinet at the far end of the room about 15 feet away 
 this plan was <unk> 
 and it worked 
 for about 6 of the required 15 feet upon which point my hands slipped and i fell through the centre of the ceiling tile towards the floor below 
 by some insane miracle i landed mostly on my feet scrambling <unk> to regain balance coughing up ceiling tile dust and god knows what else 
 probably <unk> 
 when the coughing stopped i ran over to the security panel pulled the power and plugged it back in 
 it beeped a single happy post beep and hummed to life making normal sounds instead of the endless <unk> it had been making before 
 my access restored i quickly found the problem - a circuit breaker had tripped and due to a wiring error on the part of an electrician at some point both route servers had been wired into the same circuit rather than the different feeds on different <unk> via different distribution boards that they were supposed to 
 with a <unk> and brush i set about cleaning up the nightmare my dramatic entrance had caused 
 it was not a small mess - ceiling tiles are about 5 feet by 2 feet and this one had exploded 
 it took about an hour 
 after finally <unk> up all the mess putting the ceiling tile i’d broken to get up there back together and replacing the one i’d broken getting down i walked my ass out the door feeling smug that no-one would be the <unk> for my ceiling entrance and i’d have a grand story to tell 
 monday morning rolled around and i was the last one in 
 aaron stared at me 
 & gt aaron : what the hell did you do to my desk 
 & gt chhopsky : ... wha 
 i walked into the office and stared in horror 
 i don’t know what the hell i’d cleaned up but it looked someone had hit a bag of <unk> with a <unk> bat 
 it was <unk> 
 how wasted was i 
 what did i spend an hour cleaning 
 and how in <unk> crap did i diagnose an electrical circuit being <unk> and split with no electrician tools of any kind 
 i have no idea 
 but what i did know was how to break in 
 so i documented the procedure and added it to the tech support <unk> day at it support after dealing with school computers with broken power supply finally break time 
 suddenly i hear that someone is entering my <unk> lair 
 & gt woman : good evening sir i coming here with my laptop ... hell no 
 old lady old laptop my <unk> are telling me it 's gon na be pain for next few hours 
 & gt woman : sir i do n't have internet on my laptop 
 everything was alright before i took it to xyz it support for cleaning 
 its getting even worse 
 knowing xyz <unk> it support in same small city they screwed something pretty bad as it happened many times before 
 & gt me : let me look at it i turn laptop on 
 it booted super fast like it was not old dell but new <unk> machine 
 it was at raw state from another it support chrome some random antivirus 
 but that 's none of my business turning on chrome 
 uhh ... & gt me : ma'am it looks like everything works well here internet is working alright you sure it 's not problem with your connection 
 woman looked at me like i offended her <unk> & gt woman : ca n't you see sir they deleted internet from my computer 
 oh 
 i got it ... someone in xyz deleted <unk> explorer from her laptop changing it with chrome 
 poor woman did n't had clue what chrome is 
 & gt me : oh yes 
 i see ... guess what 
 i took back internet explorer icon on the desktop and made it chrome executable 
 & gt me : done 
 you can check it ma'am she takes the laptop & gt woman : hey it 's back 
 <unk> and it looks much better now 
 you sir you are a <unk> 
 i charged her <unk> for this 
 i do n't even feel bad 
 edit : my first /r/all not sure i should be happy or <unk> rings it 's an employee at long term client ltc 
 ltc employee : hey dallasitguy it 's ok if i take the shared drive home so i can work from home today and over the weekend right '' 
 the shared drive '' is a nice big dell <unk> tower server with three <unk> <unk> exchange sql 
 me : of course not 
 what the heck are you thinking '' 
 ltc employee : i have to have some reports finished by monday 
 i ca n't get anything done here people keep interrupting me 
 so i need to work this weekend but i ca n't come in 
 so i 'm taking the shared drive home ok 
 that wo n't cause any problems right '' 
 me : it 's not ok it will cause all kinds of problems 
 do n't disconnect anything please '' 
 ltc employee : you always make such a big deal out of us doing it stuff on our own 
 it 's no big deal no one here works on the weekend and the rest of my group is out today 
 just relax i already have it in my car 
 i 'll bring it back on monday '' 
 i immediately try to remote into the server ... it 's offline 
 me : wtf 
 you already put the server in your car '' 
 mobile phone starts ringing 
 ltc owner is calling me from his mobile on my mobile 
 me : ltc employee hold on for a second your boss is calling on another line '' 
 i answer the mobile 
 ltc owner : our email is down 
 everything is down 
 we ca n't get to the internet 
 what the heck that thing is nearly new it should n't be down '' 
 me : i 'm on the phone with ltc employee 
 she has the server in her car and is about to take it home so she can work from there over the weekend 
 i 'm telling her not ... '' ltc owner : @ @ % @ # $ % % 
 # @ $ # @ $ # @ 
 @ # # $ $ @ # <unk> & amp & amp '' 
 click 
 i switch back to my landline and tell ltc employee your boss wants to talk to you right now '' 
 ltc employee : yeah i think i hear him coming down the hall 
 i 'll have the drive back monday 
 bye '' 
 click 
 i 'm going to wait until they call but i imaging i 'll be heading over there to bring the server back up 
 christ i hope she did n't just unplug it but i bet she did 
 **tl dr** - employee <unk> to take server home so she can work over the weekend 
 billable hours ensue 
 **edit : ** i 'm back from the client site 
 things were pretty f 'd 
 the vm that 's the domain controller and does file & amp print was fine thank goodness 
 the exchange server os was fine but i had to clean up the exchange database and the sql server i had recover by restoring the system image from last night 
 and there was a fourth vm that i 'd pretty much forgotten about that is just a domain controller 
 i only set it up because i had a fourth server license available 
 it was fine as well 
 the staff member apologize profusely 
 kind of annoying after a while 
 and for reference there is no server room 
 the server sits under the it desk '' at the far end of a room full of <unk> off i 've never actually done tech support 
 i 've always been a programmer but i shared this story elsewhere and someone said it was appropriate for here so now i 'm posting a more detailed version 
 it 's the summer of <unk> and my first day of my first job after spending 5 years at college for an ms in computer science 
 while the boss is showing me around he gets an important phone call leaving me outside with his 3 secretaries -- he was always very busy and would be lost without their assistance 
 we strike up some conversation about our jobs and one complains about how she has to keep track of some stuff on the server to make reports that the boss wanted daily and it 's just the most boring tedious crap 
 eventually boss comes back out and finishes showing me around and i get settled in at my desk as the lead dev comes by to get me started on some work 
 of course being the <unk> <unk> <unk> computer nerd eager to prove my worth i did n't just want to do my job 
 i wanted to do it great and really impress people 
 go above and beyond and be appreciated 
 and the complaining secretary from that morning had <unk> a great opportunity to show that i 'm a real <unk> right into my lap 
 so over my lunch break i cooked up a simple script to collate all the information she needed for her reports so that all she had to do was press one button and make sure the report was generated correctly 
 i run it by the lead dev and he <unk> it 
 i eagerly rush to tell the secretary how i 've made the worst part of her job much less horrible expecting her to be giddy at how helpful i am 
 the boss comes back from lunch as i 'm starting to tell her and he wants to know what i 'm so happy about 
 as i tell them how i 've automated the creation of those daily reports he wants his face lights up like he 's found the <unk> that <unk> golden eggs while hers drops like i just took a dump in her purse 
 it turns out that making those reports was *all* she was doing 
 the boss had hired her for that rather than just asking one of the devs to do what i had because he did n't even know it was possible 
 that was her last day there and i was instantly promoted from junior dev to normal dev with a nice pay raise for showing great initiative and saving the company the money for her salary and benefits 
 i guess i *did* get what i wanted out of it ... deep in the <unk> of the southern us <unk> there lies a collection of <unk> <unk> ... <unk> : ** **me : ** the hero whose sanity is tested greatly by those he tries to save 
 <unk> : ** an old <unk> <unk> who doubles as both in-house support phone support and procurement for the business 
 **mma : ** former mma fighter who now works as one of our front two <unk> 
 really nice but can come off as really direct and intimidating 
 <unk> : ** you 'll see ... <unk> : ** you 'll cringe ... <unk> : ** i7mom 's <unk> son 
 now normally i hate getting problem customers so early in the morning ... but this one ended up being quite <unk> 
 i am normally the second one to arrive at $ deepsouthit in the mornings 
 benchtech always gets there way before opening time to catch up on his paperwork and take inventory in case we need to order anything ... now before i get into the meat of the story a small note ... we mark up our prices compared to where we buy them 
 fairly standard practice i know and it 's not by much just enough to make a reliable profit 
 this goes for anything a customer asks us to order as well 
 now onto the show 
 i arrived this morning to find a car already parked out in front of the shop and waiting for the doors to open at <unk> since i am an on-site tech primarily i normally park up front as it is easier to get in and out of where our building is located 
 as i get out the lady in the car sees my company uniform and gets out 
 she is followed by a little <unk> <unk> 
 i tell them good morning they seem friendly enough as they greet me back 
 i open the door and for lack of other things to do i flip the open sign on and decide to man the front desk until mma gets here 
 & gt me : so how can i help you folks this morning '' 
 without saying anything the kid puts a sheet of paper on the desk 
 i take it and look it over ... it 's a list of pc parts along with a vendor name and price 
 it 's some pretty decent hardware too <unk> i7 <unk> <unk> <unk> psu something you do n't expect to get from a 12 year old ... also very expensive ... & gt i7kid : i need this built '' 
 & gt me : this is a pretty nice computer also expensive what are you going to use it for '' 
 & gt i7kid : a few video games '' 
 & gt me : is that all you are going to be using it for '' 
 & gt i7kid : yeah mostly minecraft league of <unk> and a few <unk> games '' 
 & gt me : well this will definitely run all those but this build might be a little overkill for that '' 
 & gt i7mom : look we already discussed this with his older brother he works with computers too and that 's what we want 
 we already did the research for you and those are where you can get the parts cheapest from '' 
 & gt me : well i thank you for doing that ma'am but if we order all these parts it will come out more expensive than your total listed here because we ultimately mark up our prices on hardware we order except on pre-built machines that we sell up front '' 
 & gt i7mom : that 's ridiculous 
 they 're our parts why should we pay extra for them '' 
 & gt me : that 's just our policy ma'am we would n't make much a profit on custom built machines if all we charged for was the labor so if we have to go through the trouble of ordering in all the parts especially from so many different vendors 
 if these were parts we had in stock i 'd be willing to negotiate but all of this is pretty non-standard high end equipment 
 now if you want to order the parts yourself and bring them to us we 'll be more than happy to just bill you for the labor then '' 
 & gt i7mom : i do n't have time to go hunting for all those parts and who knows when they 'd get shipped here '' 
 at this point i7mom is looking a little upset i can see benchtech looking around the corner from the back area and mma walks in and takes her seat at the second front desk and i7kid is currently playing on the demo computer we keep up front 
 & gt me : if you 'll give me a moment ma'am i 'll tally up all these parts and tell you what our price would be for it '' 
 she huffs but nods and lets me do the math ... afterward we 'd gone from a significant amount of money to a fairly <unk> <unk> with the price as high as it was 
 i tell her and at that point the vein <unk> in her temple became that much more <unk> 
 & gt i7mom : you 're trying to rip me off are n't you '' 
 & gt me : no ma'am i 'm trying to give you some options to better fit your situation 
 this build if we build it will be an amazing piece of technology 
 however for what it is being used for we can build you a significantly cheaper machine that will achieved nearly the same results '' 
 at this point her phone rings and she steps off to answer it 
 mma rolled over and asked what was going on which i fill her in to the details 
 she 's not a tech but she pays attention and understands the role various parts play in pc 's so she got the <unk> of what i7mom 's issue was 
 at this point i7mom came back up to the counter and holds her phone up to me 
 & gt i7mom : this is my oldest son he is the one who told us to buy that computer '' 
 taking the phone i say : & gt me : hello this is cyrillus at $ deepsouthit '' 
 & gt eldson : did she just say i recommended that monster of a pc '' 
 & gt me : yes sir they said you recommended these as the parts best fitting your little brother 's situation '' 
 & gt eldson : son of a b**** ... alright look i told them very very clearly that he did not need that build that i could put together a list of parts that would work great for him but he wanted what i have and i let my mother pressure me into making that list 
 i do a lot of <unk> work for my company so my computer needs that <unk> his does n't 
 do not let them talk you into building a pc that expensive my parents do n't need to go spending that kind of money right now 
 they can afford up to about two grand right now '' 
 & gt me : i understand sir i can definitely work with that '' 
 & gt eldson : great ... thanks ... here is my phone number in case you need my help convincing them '' 
 i took down his name and phone number in case i needed the <unk> ... which i am glad i did ... & gt i7mom : well '' 
 & gt me : ma'am he and i are in agreement that the parts you have listed here which he uses for a <unk> machine is too much and too expensive for what you want '' 
 & gt i7mom : you 're lying he told me those were the right parts '' 
 & gt me : he said those are *his* parts for his <unk> computer 
 your son there will not be doing the kind of things that eldson is doing 
 as i said i can save you a lot of money if you will let me put together a parts list based on what we have here and what i can order from our usual vendors where we get discounts and the mark ups may actually come out cheaper than standard '' 
 that seemed to get her attention and she agreed to at least let me make another list of parts and our price 
 i checked what we had in stock and put together a good listing for her 
 it was a decent build high end i5 one of <unk> 's better gaming mobo 's 8gb ram <unk> water cooling ... you know the kind of front line gaming build that can tackle just about anything you throw at it short of massively demanding games and applications 
 i showed i7mom the specs and more importantly the $ <unk> price tag which included assembly labor 
 she looked at the price difference and said & gt i7mom : wow ... and you 're sure this will be good '' 
 & gt me : yes ma'am that 's in line with what a lot of gamers these days use 
 in fact for the games he told me he was playing most this build is probably still overkill '' 
 & gt i7mom : that 's awesome how long would it take you to have this ready '' 
 & gt me : end of the week at the least we need to order two of the parts on this list as we do n't carry those standard 
 the rest we have in house and you wo n't have to pay the extra shipping costs on '' 
 at this point i7kid got bored of messing with our computer and decided to come up to the bench and look at the parts list i had made 
 his mom and i were in the middle of discussing payment as for things we order we have to get that in advance the rest can be paid on pickup 
 & gt i7kid : this does n't have an i7 ... '' & gt me : no but this particular i5 will be more than enough for what you need '' 
 & gt i7kid : i want an i7 ... '' & gt i7mom : honey the nice man said you do n't need it for the <unk> '' & gt i7kid in the most <unk> and high pitched screaming voice you can imagine : i want an i7 '' 
 he then proceeds to put on a <unk> face and glare daggers at his mother 
 she glares right back then looks at me & gt i7mom : any chance you can get an i7 for the price of the i5 '' 
 & gt me : ... not a chance '' 
 i know i was technically <unk> here as we did have some older i7 <unk> but after that little display i just wanted to feed the fire 
 & gt i7mom to kid : you 're not getting an i7 '' 
 for the next five minutes all we could hear was the glass <unk> screaming of what could have passed as a dying <unk> 
 all the while there were repeated sobbing <unk> of but i want an i7 '' 
 over and over and over ... in the end i7mom ended up having to drag her son out of the shop and they drove off 
 i do n't know if they will be back i do n't know if i <unk> them to come back ... mma got up and stood at the window to watch them leave and as she turned around and saw the demo computer she <unk> <unk> and waved me over should note here that the computer monitor faces the front display window 
 the kid had half a dozen tabs of porn opened ... now i *really* hope they do n't come back 
 edit : to clarify the $ <unk> price tag broke down like this 
 $ 1200 in hardware $ 250 in <unk> i have no control over this and $ 150 in labor for estimated assembly and os installation 
 edit 2 : welp definitely was n't expecting this kind of reaction glad everyone enjoyed it 
 only my third story so i 'm still trying to get reddit formatting down 
 thanks for the <unk> the comments today everyone on our network received an e-mail in foreign language with suspicious attachment word document with <unk> with encryption virus 
 it is called <unk> 
 i receive a request to look into <unk> e-mail from user 
 me : have you opened the e-mail 
 everyone has received a suspicious e-mail with encryption virus so you should not open any e-mails from unknown senders 
 user : no i have n't opened it yet 
 me : good 
 let 's delete the e-mail using shift and delete so it is not stored even in deleted items folder 
 user : wait a second 
 me : alright 
 just delete it and be careful with such e-mails in future 
 user : it had a document attached but it is only gibberish 
 could you look at it 
 me : you opened the attachment 
 user : yes 
 me : well turn off the computer unplug internet cable and you are free for the rest of the day 
 tomorrow we will take your computer it will have all its files encrypted and unusable 
 user : why did you do that 
 me : i told you it is a virus and not to open it 
 user : i 'm writing a complaint 
 she then hang up 
 -- -- -- edit : today my boss listened to recording of the phone conversation and <unk> me for being so calm 
 computer was indeed disconnected and our engineers are working on it there are few more computers that were infected from these e-mails 
 recording of the phone call will be used in investigation about the user probably will result in firing her 
 as it turns out these e-mails have been sent to all <unk> work stations that our company support 
 our guys managed to block couple of thousand e-mails and we have warned everyone about the virus but probably going to have quite a few more of idiots opening the virus 
 edit 2 : user faces charges for knowingly putting computer system at risk which can result in fairly large fine and almost certainly leads to firing 
 also it might even be considered a criminal <unk> years ago i got a field report of a few systems that were turning themselves off during the night without warning or seemingly a reason 
 we had some <unk> software that would automatically shut the system down if it got too hot and the logs showed that was what was happening 
 but it was november and the systems were in snowy <unk> so <unk> did n't make sense 
 a quick look through the code showed me the problem 
 the programmer was reading the current temperature as an <unk> <unk> instead of a signed one as the data sheet for the part specified so that an actual temperature of <unk> c which is crazy cold for a system was being read as <unk> c and so it would shut down immediately 
 later investigation found that the affected systems were in <unk> loading dock areas 
 the fix was of course easy but testing it required putting the system in our kitchen freezer with the various cables coming out for power the monitor and so on 
 the ceo walked in while i was sitting there with a keyboard mouse and monitor seemingly hooked up to the refrigerator and just said i do n't think that i should ask what you 're doing '' 
 after recovery from my stroke i was in desperate need of work 
 so desperate i took an overnight shift at an <unk> for tech support 
 most nights it was pretty calm and people that called on my shift were usually just looking for more help with their website than just trouble shooting but night staff had the time and it helped break up the monotony of the shift 
 occasionally i would get gems like this 
 & amp nbsp i get a call and the guy is frantic on the phone 
 after finally getting him to confirm his username and password i ask which website of his is down 
 i type the url into my web browser and surprise i get his website no issues 
 next i vpn to my home computer and pull it up there no issue again this is where we get into basic pc troubleshooting reminder this guy is losing $ 1k/hr because his website is down '' & amp nbsp it is at this point that we get into basic pc troubleshooting and the following transpired 
 me : okay are you using a mac or pc cus : pc me : can you click on the start menu and type in cmd cus : i can not the screen is black me : *deep <unk> is there a light on the front of your monitor and or your tower cus : no me : <unk> <unk> is the cable plugged into the back of the device and can you trace that cable back to make sure it is plugged into the wall 
 if you have a power strip can you see if it is in the on position cus : <unk> i think it is but can not quite tell me : what do you mean you can not tell 
 cus : i ca n't tell it is dark me : dark 
 can you turn on a light cus : i could get a flashlight but there is no power me : <unk> desk* i assure you sir your website is up you can check it again when you have power back & amp nbsp tl : dr someone making ~ $ 1k/hr '' from his website was unable to tell the difference between him being out of power and his website being down ... & amp nbsp edit : formatting second edit : rip inbox thanks for all the replies stories very entertaining okay so the vpn service went down and as a result everyone in the universe is calling us asking what 's wrong why ca n't they get in when will it be up yada yada yada 
 we put a voice message on the line telling people there 's an outage and we 'll get it taken care of as soon as possible 
 some people hear this and probably hang up knowing that it 's being addressed others wait on hold for fifteen or twenty minutes just to complain to us that the hold time was too long and give us belligerent advise on how to maintain a vpn that we have no control over 
 of course there are lots of people who 've been on hold for twenty minutes long enough to hear the outage alert at least ten times just so they can ask us questions that would have been explained in the outage alert 
 i would get calls like when is it going to be back up 
 what happened 
 why ca n't i get in '' 
 i 'm literally praying for an <unk> strike because humanity has become that damn stupid 
 i get a lot of really belligerent callers who are threatening to take me to task if i do n't get them a solution to log in soon 
 i keep telling them that there is nothing to be done but one lady i have to write up a complaint on to my manager for follow up with hr because she crossed a line in her complaints 
 this is the pattern of the day and finally it happened 
 two <unk> over from me a loud angry call goes into a headset motherfucker clean the shit out of your ears 
 you sit on hold listening to a message that answers all these questions and you still wait to ask me what you already know 
 how 'd some peckerwood motherfucker like you get a job with a computer '' 
 she called him peckerwood '' maybe the caller is in the south 
 she growled into the phone some <unk> words hung up grabbed her purse and walked out 
 just then my boss comes running up after hearing what was yelled at a client wondering what happened 
 the lady i was on the phone with who was n't being belligerent heard what was said and asked me specifically if she really heard someone tell a caller to clean the shit out of their ears 
 i apologized to the caller and explained we 're inundated with calls and we 've gotten so many rude callers our ability to keep professional has strained to it 's limits 
 she was understanding and hoped everything worked out 
 i do n't know what her standing will be tomorrow i 'm pretty sure she 's gon na get fired 
 but for a minute i looked back on what she said into the phone and managed to laugh she lived the dream 
 i wish i did n't envy her a little bit but how many times have i wanted to say the same thing to a rude caller 
 update update update update update she was not fired but she 's been suspended for a couple of days and is has to get some <unk> 
 the call was recorded and though it was not made available to anyone i learned that the caller was very nasty to her 
 she 's going to be coming back but she 's had some other things that have been bothering her and it 's all <unk> 
 i work at a hospital 
 doctors are the worst people to support and because of that i see a <unk> <unk> for all my health needs <unk> from that most people are pretty average accept for <unk> 
 <unk> works in the <unk> of my <unk> 
 he 's always friendly and smiles at everyone 
 he also has down syndrome but we sort of take care of him and let him know what a good job he does ever chance we get 
 so today i 'm derping at my desk and i get a call it 's ben 
 me : helpdesk this is wonderweirdo ben : hi wonderweirdo i need someone to come look at the computer in the mail room it wont get onto the net 
 me : okay let 's do some trouble shooting 
 ben : i already tried a couple of things i rebooted the computer and when that did n't work i tried to refresh the ip and a dns flush that did n't work either 
 i tried to ping yahoo.com but nothing came back me : impressed wow you did all that already 
 okay did you check to see if the network cable is connected '' 
 ben : yeah the <unk> is flashing that orange color 
 me : nodding okay i 'll put in a ticket and get someone from deskside over there 
 ben : thank you 
 me : you know ben that was some pretty good work you did 
 you should come over to it and work with us 
 ben : giggling nah i see the way you guys go crazy over there i 'm too smart to do that 
 i chuckle for a second and after i put in the ticket and end the call i realize how a kid with down syndrome did the trouble shooting before he called for help and how that kid with down syndrome had better computer skills than the doctors i support 
 then it hit me that he said he was too smart to come over to it and work because he can see how we all go crazy 
 so he said he 's basically smarter than me 
 after taking a minute to look around at myself and my peers i think he 's right 
 my first job out of college was a <unk> position 
 i 'm an <unk> engineer with a minor in mechanical and i 've worked it my whole life before i graduated so they had me consulting on design <unk> modeling programming everything ... so i 'm working at a small <unk> company making a system for light <unk> hence my <unk> story here one of the things i had to do while i was there was design a database to track all the paperwork and keep track of everything that we <unk> for a 5 year period 
 so i do 
 spent about 6 months getting everything <unk> out to the point where i could roll it out to the office like 5 whole users 
 i sent a 1 page document with it on how to operate it and tell them that if they have an error they are to click on nothing - i put a lot of effort into error reporting 
 this was my first <unk> sql program and it <unk> a lot of external functionality with office documents pdfs automatically printing reports etc so there were a lot of moving parts that could go wrong 
 they did n't listen 
 so i sent out a link to everybody that would update the program on their computer with the only explanation being improved error reporting functionality '' 
 and tell them that their old program will no longer work so they have to update 
 fast forward to about lunch time when i suddenly hear the old <unk> python line no one expects the spanish inquisition '' 
 at maximum volume from down the hall closely followed by holy s*** '' and a few other choice surprise expletives 
 i quickly hop out of my seat and walk down the hall only to find my boss is sitting about 4 feet from his desk looking a bit pale as i walk in and try to not laugh & gt & gt boss man : what the hell just happened 
 & gt & gt me : you hit an error 
 & gt & gt boss man : but why did it yell at me 
 & gt & gt me : because nobody was telling me what errors they were getting so i <unk> up a notification for myself ... and this was the simplest solution to the problem 
 what the update really did was add a few lines of code to set the system volume to 100 % and play a <unk> file at full blast so i would hear it and i could come talk to the user about what they were doing when the error occurred and read what the error said 
 needless to say they were less than thrilled with my improved error reporting functionality '' and i told them i 'd take it out as long as they continued to report errors to me and they gladly complied 
 tl dr - the average user would rather talk to the developer than face the wrath of the spanish inquisition 
 edit yay gold 
 thanks mister anonymous '' - you seem to be everywhere on the <unk> little <unk> as i am still annoyed over this mostly because i should 've seen it coming 
 my <unk> came to me with a request two weeks before christmas if i could <unk> a new gaming laptop for his sister and her <unk> old son in such a way it would be as <unk> as possible 
 sure no big deal 
 i upgraded the windows <unk> it came with to windows 10 set up a <unk> account as admin and a <unk> account as a limited user 
 <unk> the games it came with and installed steam all setup for her account 
 to top it off i installed a copy of avira antivirus and set everything up to update automatically then gave my bil specific instructions to tell his sister never to allow the kid to log into her account 
 laptop is packaged back up and goes under her tree ... and yesterday i receive a frantic phone call if i can come over to my bil 's place as the laptop has problems 
 i boot it up to windows and find a <unk> virus has made its way onboard 
 glad it 's not connected to any network just as a client on the guest wireless i ask for the history 
 december 25th : laptop is unpacked and little vandal is overjoyed 
 joy that quickly turns to anger as he ca n't install random apps 
 december <unk> : little vandal has gotten his mom 's password and finds he still can not install the <unk> he wants so he <unk> <unk> and <unk> avira 
 december 27 morning : cryptolocker has done its work and has destroyed the laptop 
 december 27 midday : i pull my hair out in frustration 
 fortunately i had a recovery disc with me so i just wiped the os and did a reinstall 
 windows 10 automatically <unk> 
 i reinstall avira and lock it with a separate password ... unfortunately i had to still give the mom admin rights but i <unk> how it was definitely 100 % that little vandal managed to get access to her account that messed things up 
 laptop works again mom is happy with me and angry with the kid bil beers me and i tell them all that the next time i will be charging money 
 <unk> = user account control wiki tldr : if you allow the vandals to enter <unk> do n't cry if <unk> is <unk> set the scene i 'm currently a student studying computer science and i work at my university 's help and repair desk 
 i 've seen a lot everything from a $ 1 <unk> lights turning into a $ 1500 macbook replacements to <unk> students losing <unk> to <unk> people still using dial-up in 2014 and of course tons of virus as a result of college students clicking ads in an endless search of free music movies and porn 
 this specific case happened about a year ago and i want to share it because i think about it from time to time 
 i was sitting in my consulting station probably browsing reddit and attempting to homework when our receptionist greeted a user took his information a brief description of his problem and added his ticket to the queue 
 i do n't remember his name but his problem description was just needs to remove audio file from phone '' 
 figured heh this should be easy a typical old faculty member needing help with his phone kinda thing i asked him to come sit at my station and took a look at his problem 
 he sat down next to me and pulled out his phone an old <unk> ii i think and an even older laptop 
 i asked him what was wrong and he told me that he had some voicemails on his phone that he wanted to save on his computer kind of an odd request but i went with it anyway 
 he unlocks his phone for me and i navigate to his phone app and pull up the voicemail 
 while i was looking at the phone he said there were 3 voicemails from the previous weekend were the ones he wanted saved 
 i played the first one on speaker to see if they were playing properly and it was really quick message 
 hey dad just wanted to let you know i 'm on my way home 
 see you soon love ya bye '' 
 oh no ... i looked up from the phone and i saw this poor man start crying 
 i put two and two together and my worst thought was confirmed 
 this poor man had just lost his daughter in a car accident a few days before and he want her last voicemails to him so he and his wife could still hear her voice whenever they missed her 
 not breaking down into tears for his man was harder than any ticket i 've ever taken 
 his daughter was my age and it immediately made me think of my family and how much they missed me 
 i knew then i was going to do everything in my power to get this right 
 my first thought was to just plug an aux cord into the headphone jack on his phone and record the audio using audacity on his laptop 
 but when i plugged an aux cable into his phone and laptop i could n't get anything to record 
 shit 
 i tried using my headphones to see if i could hear anything on his phone and nothing 
 i looked inside the aux jack and i all i could see was dirt and something sticking out of a <unk> on mess 
 i ran his phone upstairs to our repair desk and grabbed compressed air <unk> <unk> alcohol <unk> just about anything that i could thing of that would clean out his headphone jack 
 after about 10 min or so of cleaning i could finally hear audio coming out of my headphones 
 relieved i recorded all the voicemail messages and saved them for him to be able to listen to whenever he wanted 
 i felt awful for what this guy had to go through and i was glad i was able to help him 
 to me this was a reminder of how quickly life can change 
 i 'm sure everyone on this subreddit will sympathize with me whenever i need to complain about bad users or just dumb people but just remember for some users you can make a world of difference for them 
 edit : wow thanks to everyone showing support 
 i never thought working tech support would ever leave me with a story i would never forget 
 edit2 : thanks for the gold 
 as awesome as it is to get gold it feels different getting it for a story like <unk> story takes place at a radio station 
 yesterday i got a ticket with the title & gt no sound need it to work '' with the very detailed description & gt please fix it '' 
 i did n't know it yet but i 've been waiting for this ticket for about a year 
 a similar thing happened then and i 've been plotting what i 'd do in a similar situation since then 
 i came to $ user 's desk and immediately knew what i had to do 
 what i had prepared for 
 what i was destined to do 
 what would be my legacy in this company 
 i was about to blow this poor user 's mind 
 i saw the little circle with the red line through it next to the speaker in the task bar and my <unk> started pumping 
 it was time 
 so i wave both my hands over the keyboard <unk> quietly and as i 'm waving my hands around i subtly hit the mute '' button on the keyboard 
 i turn to the user and <unk> it 's fixed '' and walk away from the mind explosion 
 behind me i hear what '' 
 followed by a click and the sound of a promotion audio clip playing and i know : from this point on my story will be passed on to generations 
 the story of the machine <unk> 
 the <unk> pc guy 
 the tech support wizard 
 from this day on i have to lead a life of secrecy 
 what if anyone found out what i had actually done 
 i would become an <unk> 
 declared a freak 
 driven into <unk> 
 i 'm the hero this station deserves 
 they wo n't hunt me 
 because i know magic 
 because i 'm not their hero i 'm a silent <unk> a <unk> protector a tech support wizard 
 so this happened to me a few days ago and if it 's taught me anything it 's that jobs will apparently come back to haunt you from the grave 
 a little bit of background i 'm a former <unk> technician and used to <unk> a small business which i quit a year ago for reasons 
 every so often i 'll get <unk> clients calling me for service from looking at old business cards and a few times i 've actually gone and done work for them no problem 
 extra money is never an issue 
 i got a call a couple days ago from an angry customer that i vaguely remember servicing nearly 2 years ago who we shall call $ al 
 the exchange that ensued goes as follows : & gt $ me : hello this is mini speaking '' 
 & gt $ al : yes you serviced a machine of mine a while back and something has gone wrong with it 
 i understand my warranty is still good and i was hoping to get this fixed as soon as possible '' 
 at this point i 'm wondering how she got my number 
 i recently got a new phone with a new number so this really did n't make much sense but i carried on 
 & gt $ me : alright miss 
 i 'm sorry to say i do n't work there anymore but i can certainly come out and do the job for you for a fee 
 if that 's not an issue could you please tell me what machine and what sort of issues it 's having 
 perhaps i can work it out over the phone '' 
 & gt $ al : but the machine is still under warranty 
 should n't the repair be free '' 
 & gt $ me : no ma'am i do n't work for $ company anymore 
 if you ask me to come and repair your machine i 'll be working freelance 
 that warranty is only valid with $ company who to be honest i do n't know if they exist anymore '' 
 & gt $ al : but the warranty has your name on it 
 that should mean you honour it no matter what '' 
 at this point she 's getting irritated 
 apparently she expects me to do the work for free 
 & gt $ me : while it may have my name on it it does n't mean i have to honour it 
 granted yes i 'll discount because it was my work to begin with i 'm not going to come out and service the machine for free 
 as i said the warranty is only with $ company who i am not a part of anymore '' 
 & gt $ al : this is ridiculous 
 i was told by $ <unk> at $ company that you 'd come out and do this no problem 
 i really need this fixed as soon as possible and i was guaranteed there would n't be a problem '' 
 & gt $ me : i 'm sorry ma'am i 'm sorry for any inconvenience but i 'm certainly not going to come out for free to do work that $ company should be handling even if it has my name on it 
 you still have n't said what the issue is '' 
 & gt $ al : no the issue here is that i have a warranty a signed contract with *your* name on it '' 
 & gt $ me : but that is only valid with $ company 
 i 'm not going to go out and do their work for them on my free time for free '' 
 at this point i 'm ready to just hang up the phone 
 i 've been polite and professional even though i did n't have to be at all ... and to be honest i 'm rather confused now because i 'm sure i 've said to her i 'm not their employee anymore '' 
 & gt $ al : but i was <unk> by $ company that this would be handled for free 
 they told me you would have no problems and this warranty was guaranteed for the lifetime of the machine '' 
 & gt $ me : ma'am what part of i do n't work there anymore '' do n't you understand 
 i do n't care what he said i 'm not tied to them anymore 
 i 'm seriously happy to help but i 'm not going to <unk> come out and do this for free just because the guy i worked for a year ago said i would 
 that 's not how it works '' 
 & gt $ al : i 'm reporting you this is absolutely ridiculous '' 
 & gt $ me : hah 
 to who 
 my mum '' 
 at that point she hung up 
 it 's been 3 days now and going over that i 'm still just as confused as to what she was thinking as i was when she called me if not more 
 people will never cease to <unk> me 
 and i still do n't know how she got my number <unk> edit : oh dear <unk> i certainly was n't expecting to make it to <unk> 
 i 'm humbled 
 and i took out an <unk> $ that was in the wrong place 
 today i am a semi retired semi burnt out old tech spending my declining years in a small rural area 
 but when i was little more than a <unk> faced <unk> i was the technical manager of a electronics distribution company that was in the process of being swallowed up by a big multinational 
 it was an exciting time complete upgrade of the network new servers and computers <unk> into a multinational system 
 extra it support staff and i was in charge of the project from our end 
 exciting times in a very short time the project was completed and would you believe it well under the expected time and 35 % under budget 
 it was even fun to complete 
 then the fun came to a crashing halt in the <unk> between us and the executive in charge '' of it for the company that now owned us 
 i was expecting a thanks for <unk> all requirements maybe even a small bonus 
 instead i was told that the systems would all be run from new head office and there would only be 2 it positions to support all 5 offices across the country all hardware support was being outsourced 
 the real kicker was that the positions being offered where little more than tier 1 positions to submit tickets to the hardware support company or to the head office support team 
 the <unk> being offered was 60 % less than my current salary 
 i calmly asked him to confirm that he was firing 12 people and offering a <unk> to the 2 who would remain 
 then i simply said no '' dropped my id and keys on the desk picked up my coffee cup and left the building 
 all the it staff followed me 
 i never formally resigned but i think they got the idea that i was not coming back 
 i got a job delivering pizza for the two months it took me to find a new it position 
 i still made more money than they had offered me 
 tl/dr a young it manager has his first brush with corporate management 
 refuses to play the game i love my cousins <unk> not in that way but they 're often thick as <unk> 
 so it was with no shock to me when i get a text from one of them saying that he ca n't connect to the internet 
 oh and someone 's changed the name of his wifi to stop stealing my wifi '' 
 having been to his house before - and connected to his wifi - i know for a fact he has a wireless router and a password set up by his isp 
 i go through basic troubleshooting turn it on and off it it plugged in etc and eventually say he should look at the label on his router and connect to the ssid written on it 
 he says it 's not on the list and asks me to come round and have a look i 'm a 30 minute train journey from his house so <unk> round feels more like a day trip 
 anyway i get there and sure enough the ssid on his router is n't there 
 i try the <unk> stealing ssid tried the password written on the router and it did n't work 
 i ask him if he 's changed the wifi password 
 he - of course - said he did n't have one 
 that he went into the admin controls and turned it off a week ago because he got a new phone and forgot what the password was 
 i go back to the router and show him the label with the ssid and the password 
 it 's at this point i noticed that all the lights on the front are <unk> on et <unk> <unk> 
 and then it clicks 
 he made his wifi public 
 someone nearby accidentally connected to his and thinks it 's <unk> own wifi 
 yet they had enough computer knowledge or google-fu or luck to get into the admin page and lock it down 
 so i look up the default admin credentials on my phone - turns out it 's admin '' with no password - reset the router to factory settings log in to the admin console set up a secure admin password of my choosing and set up <unk> and a password of his choosing 
 *and told him not to remove <unk> and changed the ssid to no it 's not your wifi '' 
 **tl dr** it 's not your wifi if you do n't have physical access to the <unk> i 'm doing my casual helping hand labor at college making sure all professors have backups and working cad software everything okay happy <unk> everywhere 
 but then the fire nation attacked 
 i was done doing backups of everyone 's favourite $ glassesprofessor after getting his laptop back happy ending 
 when we suddenly see his <unk> $ mrangryglasses come in and point at me with an angry yet cold look 
 & gt $ mrangryglasses : crescent you playing tech support student was funny but now you managed to screw everything this time pack your stuff and get out 
 me and $ glassesprofessor could n't get to understand what was just going on why was he being like that 
 & gt $ me : excuse me professor $ mrangryglasses but what are you talking about 
 & gt $ mrangryglasses : you know what you did you caused a massive security breach at this college pack your stuff and get out i 'll let the principal know what you did 
 & gt $ me : but ... what ... 
 then i saw the security guard coming through the door making me signs to stand up and follow him i still had no idea what was going on ... thankfully our hero $ glassesprofessor decided to stand up for me 
 & gt $ glassesprofessor : woah woah woah hold it $ mrangryglasses crescent did nothing like that he 's been a good student and tech support guy you are not taking him away until we all get to know what happened 
 & gt $ me : please professor $ mrangryglasses what are you even me accusing of 
 another teacher heard what was going on the head teacher of the <unk> 
 & gt $ mrsengineering : what is even going on here what are you even doing to crescent 
 & gt $ mrangryglasses : ah head teacher good that you are here 
 he pointed at me 
 & gt $ mrangryglasses : this kid messed with the secretary 's computer now her files are lost the screen is broken and a <unk> voice is controlling it 
 my capacity to even was broken first i 'm never allowed to handle computers like that second its obvious why third what was that <unk> voice and broken screen 
 & gt $ mrsengineering : calm down $ mrangryglasses we need to first take a look at that virus '' of yours 
 and so we were escorted to the principal 's office and a very angry secretary was staring at me after a discussion with everyone involved i was able to handle the computer 
 what could possibly go wrong 
 i was just on the edge of being expelled 
 so i take a look at the screen and immediately recognize it it was no virus no spyware it was something much worse for everyone in the room 
 windows 10 
 & gt $ me : professors ... this is n't a virus ... this is the new version of windows 
 everyone was staring at me i sigh and look at them 
 & gt $ me : secretary you installed a recommended update '' right 
 & gt $ secretary : yes for security measures now look at what it happened with everything you did to the other computers 
 i struggled not to loose my mind but the kind $ glassesprofessor help me explain the whole windows 10 thing and the secretary nearly cried for what she did not the only one ... so i reverted windows back to 7 everything was still working good good everyone was happy except $ mrangryglasses who refused to say a thing 
 i need a break 
 tl dr : secretary got windows 10 by herself i deserve the chair 
 update : so i did have a meeting with the board of teachers and the director in case it was n't clear this is how colleges in mexico work or so it 's my understanding i <unk> the whole story to the director of the college with $ glassesprofessor to my side she was patient and hear us both with $ mrangryglasses sitting on the other end of the table she concluded it was a extremely serious accusation and turns out the rumors were true his attitude and he 's already <unk> internal investigation for <unk> while he 's unlikely to be fired for reasons i can not learn about i wo n't be <unk> any of his classes in the future 
 so i 'm completely <unk> of all charges and to avoid any future incidents we are revoking all user permissions and hope to create an official it department i 'll have some compensation for the incident no semester payment for two years woo <unk> 
 and a couple of other things 
 thanks everyone for their wonderful support your ideas will help this college have a better future cheers i saw a story yesterday about letting users set ticket priority and it hit home with me 
 we allow the same thing so naturally every single ticket i get is marked critical 
 i just laugh about it now 
 anyway about a week ago one of my favorite users kurt '' came over to my cube with a problem 
 hey man '' he said 
 i 've been going back and forth for a while trying to decide whether to mark this case <unk> or <unk> 
 i do n't want to cause you guys too much trouble 
 what do you think '' 
 kurt bless your heart '' i said 
 i have n't looked at that field in five years '' 
 then i dropped everything i was doing and helped him set up his new phone 
 because he deserved <unk> this was an interesting one 
 we have a user who uses a laptop and a docking station 
 the docking station is wired into an ethernet port so if the wifi went down for whatever reason there is a backup wired connection 
 well i was tasked to install a new desktop computer in the same room as the user unfortunately we have run out of ports in our switch to <unk> this extra desktop pc so it was agreed that we would recycle this users ethernet cable from his docking station 
 so i simply unplug his cable and plug it into the new desktop 
 i was having trouble assigning an ip from our dhcp server so after a bit of <unk> about i realized the network cable was coiled up and unplugged from the wall under the table 
 so i plug it into wall and patch the switch upstairs 
 job done 
 4 hours later i get a complaint from the irate user saying now that he is using wifi his network connection is very slow and unusable and demands we sort a cable for him 
 so i pick up a new cable connect one end into his docking station <unk> up the other end and leave it <unk> under his table and ask him to reboot his laptop 
 not had a complaint <unk> the university i work for we regularly get calls from parents trying to do everything for their children 
 even though we are n't really supposed to do a password reset for someone who is n't the account holder our standard procedure in the case of a parent trying to reset their kid 's password is to get the account holder on the line and ask their permission for the password reset before continuing 
 with freshman orientation coming up we had several calls like this today but this one was a little different 
 & gt me : $ university service desk this is nathan how can i help you 
 & gt mother : i need to reset my son 's password and get some information about his account 
 i wo n't be going with him to orientation and want to write it all down for him 
 & gt me : do you have your son there with you 
 we will need to get his permission to reset his password 
 & gt mother : of course let me go get him 
 & gt mother yelling : get down here 
 i need you to give the man on the phone permission to look at your account 
 & gt son : hello 
 & gt me : this is nathan from $ university service desk i just need your permission to reset your password 
 & gt son : no my password does not need to be reset 
 we will call you again if there are any issues 
 & gt *phone slams down but line does not <unk> & gt *background yelling for the remainder of the time before i leave the <unk> i think i may have just been party to the moment a child became independent 
 so i 'm family friends neighbors and sometimes school tech support 
 so yesterday was my day off 
 i have no classes on <unk> 
 school for me started almost 2 weeks ago and for k-12 it started a week ago 
 i get a call from one of my neighbors 
 she 's a really really sweet little lady who <unk> from mexico around 15 years ago 
 she 's a single mom with a 12 year old boy who absolutely loves his computer 
 his dad built it for him a couple years ago before he died in a mining accident 
 he will not let anyone touch it 
 i love getting calls from her because she makes me a lot of really good mexican food and she takes to instruction well 
 so she explains her issue 
 & gt her : i have a issue 
 okay wonder what 's going on 
 she calls me for a lot of things 
 & gt me : okay what seems to be the problem 
 & gt her : my son 's room 
 its on fire 
 & gt me : what 
 call 911 
 & gt her : wait 
 fire not right word 
 & gt me : okay 
 are you meaning hot 
 <unk> 
 & gt her : si 
 & gt me : i 'll be over in a couple minutes 
 i grab my tech support bag and my general repair bag and head over 
 i get there and she leads me to her son 's room and the second i walk in i get hit by a wall of heat 
 it 's almost 10 degrees hotter than the rest of the house 
 & gt me : holy 
 fire is n't too far off 
 & gt her : si 
 & gt me : okay 
 i 'll see what i can figure out 
 i walk over and the closer i get to the computer the hotter it gets 
 i touch the computer and the case is physically hot 
 i shake it awake 
 enter the boy 's password i remember it from the time he got a lot of malware from doing what boys his age do 
 i check his core temps and see them at <unk> then check his gpu temps and see they 're at <unk> and <unk> 
 shit 
 that is not good 
 i turn it off open the case and <unk> <unk> the parts 
 nothing looks out of the ordinary just really hot 
 i turn the computer back on put it into bios and look to see what 's going on in the case 
 i look at it and realize none of the fans except the cpu fan are spinning 
 i run back home and grab a couple <unk> fans i have laying around from taking a few old computers apart 
 i plug them in and the work 
 i pull out the original fans and put in the new ones 
 i run prime95 and wait for half an hour while i 'm waiting on my food and for him to get home 
 i 'm sitting there reading on my phone monitoring temps while i read reddit 
 i hear the door open and spin around in the chair 
 he comes running in and attempts to <unk> me 
 i 'm <unk> '' and <unk> pounds he 's <unk> '' and <unk> pounds i hold my arm out and push him back by his head 
 i get him calmed down after a minute or two and get him to sit down on the bed 
 & gt him : why were you touching my computer 
 & gt me : your room has been really hot lately right 
 & gt him : yeh i guess 
 & gt me : your fans failed and the ones remaining could n't push air well enough through the case to keep the <unk> down 
 & gt him : oh 
 okay 
 & gt me : i put in new fans and it should be cooler and the computer should last longer 
 he cracked a smile for the first time all night 
 & gt me : i thought you 'd like that 
 & gt him : thank you 
 he starts quietly happy crying and hugs me 
 i make sure the temps were good and turn off prime95 
 i start an antivirus scan 
 & gt me : let 's get some food 
 we go into the kitchen and his mom had made fresh <unk> and a whole bunch more mexican dishes 
 tl dr : i love doing this job sometimes even when i do n't get paid actual money 
 edit : <unk> ... i do n't technically have a job in it but i work in a games shop so i spend most of my day reformatting <unk> and showing people how to connect <unk> 
 one day a kid came in with his parents 
 he was around 10 years old 
 he walked up to the counter put a copy of <unk> v for the <unk> in front of me and announced that it did n't work and he wanted his money back 
 i glanced at his parents unsure whether or not they knew that this was an <unk> game that they were allowing their child to play but they looked annoyed so i did n't comment 
 me : sure no problem 
 what 's the problem exactly '' 
 kid : so i put in the disc 1 and that 's all fine 
 but then i put in disc 2 and nothing changes 
 it still wants disc 2 '' 
 me : okay that is odd 
 i 'll just throw it in my <unk> and have a look '' he looked annoyed that i was n't just taking his word but i ignored it and carried on 
 the customer is almost never right about these things 
 i test it in front of him and everything works fine 
 i look up at his parents as i put the game back on the counter 
 kid : but it does n't work on my <unk> '' 
 both him and his father looked annoyed at me 
 i do n't know how it even crossed my mind the only explanation is that this job has <unk> me to the total lack of common sense of the general public 
 me : <unk> probably a silly question but when it asks for disc 2 ... you take disc 1 out of the tray before inserting disc 2 right 
 i looked at the kid 
 silence 
 i look up at the father who is also staring at his kid 
 dad : you did that right '' 
 more silence 
 i slide the game across the counter 
 have a nice day 
 like most sane individuals i am on my countries national do not call list 
 unfortunately a few less than scrupulous companies did n't get the memo 
 this is the story of how i provided tech support '' to one in particular 
 for the past few months i have been receiving calls from <unk> asking if i want % <unk> % 's services 
 the first few times i politely told them to respect the do not call list and do not call again 
 when they kept on ignoring that i figured it was time to use my voip support abilities for some fun 
 so one evening i was hanging out with my family raising my kids and such when i hear my phone politely inform me that there is a long distance call coming in 
 looking at the caller id i see the number of someone who legally should not be calling me 
 being slightly bored i answered and prepared to have some fun 
 this telemarketing company gave away <unk> of information about it 's system within the first few seconds of a call 
 by having 5 seconds of silence followed by the unmistakable default <unk> conference join sound i already know what software they are running how they manage their agent queue and quite a few ways to <unk> ask them to not call again 
 once i heard the conference connect beep i have to work quickly to set my trap hoping that they would take the <unk> 
 me : tech support can i have your agent # please '' <unk> : ... ... .. um hello i 'm calling from % company % and '' me : i 'm going to stop you there 
 your system has detected that there is a issue with your workstation and has automatically sent you through to tech support 
 can i have your agent id please '' confused <unk> : is this mr <unk> i 'm speaking with '' me : no your system is still displaying the last expected connection on the screen however you have been connected to tech support due to the issue which your system detected 
 can i have your agent id so i can help you with this '' 
 *i 'm obviously making a guess about what type of setup they might have hoping that i 'm close enough to completely <unk> the prey into the <unk> sheep : oh ok my id is % probably a default setup value <unk> by the number of agents % me : ok thank you now i just need some info while i pull up your system 
 can you take a quick look at your phone 
 does it say polycom '' on the front '' 
 sheep : yes '' me : ok i 'm showing a potential issue with your phone 
 i need you to run a diagnostic on the phone 
 can you let me know when you are ready '' 
 sheep on the ramp to the <unk> : ok what do i have to do '' 
 me : ok on your phone i need you to press 4 6 8 and * at the same time let me know when you are done sheep : ok it 's asking for a password '' me : <unk> their voip admin left things at <unk> ok now enter <unk> as the password then press the button marked enter '' 
 <unk> : <unk> conference sound* and it has been a few months since i last heard from them 
 some technical details for those who do not work with voip and polycom products 
 the sequence above is the reload firmware and reset to factory defaults <unk> and the default password to allow the reload 
 most polycom phones take about <unk> minutes to reload the firmware reboot and reload settings 
 more if they did n't setup dhcp properly 
 **tl dr : ** i know more about your phone system than your company does edit : <unk> and a thank you to everyone who upvoted <unk> or replied 
 especially <unk> for letting us know about <unk> was a conversation not 20 minutes ago over our <unk> messaging system here at <unk> r us 
 -- -- -- -- -- *user is starting a conversation* *user has invited & lt 7 managers & gt * user : cookie_eater108 keeps changing my password its not funny <unk> 1 has left the conversation* me : i 'm sorry what 's this about 
 user : cookie_eater108 you keep changing my password every few days and i can never login 
 very <unk> 
 <unk> 2 has left the conversation* me : i assure you i do n't change passwords for fun 
 but i can help you with your login troubles 
 me : at the top right of your keyboard there are 3 lights <unk> lock caps lock and scroll lock is the caps lock key light on 
 user : well it was n't on just awhile ago user : stop turning my caps lock key on this is unbelievable * & lt 5 managers have left the conversation & gt * got a priority request from a <unk> executive her new laptop was broken 
 a minor fix easily corrected by system restore 
 while the restore was going on ms. senior executive was having an epic rant we waste both my time and yours by purchasing these unreliable <unk> laptops 
 whoever heard of <unk> '' laptops anyway 
 i was <unk> for a moment and then silently turned her laptop around so that she could see that <unk> was actually <unk> upside down 
 she turned bright red and then started laughing 
 then she gave me a glare that could freeze ice and said if i find this story posted on facebook your employment with this company is over '' 
 i nodded and solemnly agreed this episode was absolutely inappropriate for facebook 
 i thought i 'd share one of my <unk> moments as a bench tech 
 i suspect most of us who are interested in this type of work frequently encounter customers with lost data 
 usually the issue is resolved with a simple <unk> application of which there are many 
 sometimes we have to roll up our <unk> and image the disk and attempt to recover readable files 
 no matter the method it 's the best feeling in the world to be able to call the customer and tell then you did recover their wedding pictures or important school work 
 the look on their faces when they come in to pick up the freshly burned dvd with their critical data makes you forget all the <unk> with their insect <unk> <unk> almost 
 but then there 's that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you plug in the customer 's pc and hear the click bang '' or <unk> <unk> '' of a failed hdd while the bios reports no bootable drive 
 you have to look them in the eye and tell them you are already 99 % sure the drive is dead and there is nothing you can do about it 
 you hand them the little card with the number to drivesavers or similar professional data recovery and warn them it 's going to cost a lot of money 
 you are kind enough not to <unk> them about their lack of a backup that would only cause pain now 
 they already know 
 flash back to <unk> one morning i get to the shop to find a customer standing outside the front door with one of those <unk> <unk> dell pcs under an arm 
 the look in his eyes alone tells me all i really need to know about the situation 
 i tell him to come in and put the pc on the counter 
 we exchange <unk> as i plug in the monitor and keyboard and turn it on 
 we encounter the message he told me to expect the pc ca n't find a bootable drive 
 i open it up to make sure everything is plugged in and notice the drive is not spinning 
 not good but there could be an innocent answer 
 i pull the drive and try it out with a known good power supply 
 unfortunately with the same result 
 i tell him customer it seems you have a failed hard drive 
 since it wo n't spin up i ca n't really help you '' 
 his exact words : it does n't matter what it costs please get my data back '' 
 it turns out this guy is an office manager at a local <unk> practice 
 it must be a fairly big organization as they <unk> about 10 <unk> and about 40 other folks including cleaning staff etc 
 this pc under his arm contains the <unk> of their accounting everything 
 payroll tax stuff accounts <unk> everything 
 he explains that they will go out of business if they ca n't get the data on that drive 
 i let him know that data recovery from a failed drive takes specialized skills and resources neither of which we have in this mom 'n pop computer repair <unk> 
 i give him the drivesavers card and tell him to be prepared for a bill in the $ 1000 's if they are successful at all 
 considering the importance of his data i thought it was a <unk> to go this route 
 $ 2000 is nothing to a medical office likely billing out over a million dollars each year 
 well i would not be writing this if the dude had any sense 
 he 's like : $ 2000 for data recovery 
 and it might take weeks 
 i do n't know ... ca n't you do it '' 
 i tell him the truth : if i try to recover his data and fail there is a huge chance i 'll make it worse and less likely for a professional data recovery specialist to get it 
 he really needs to go to the specialist 
 yet despite this he continues to talk me into it telling me they ca n't possibly go weeks without this pc 
 they need their data by tomorrow for tax reasons 
 so i told him to give me his number and i 'd do some research and get back to him 
 i call in my fellow nerds and we research our google-fu was strong that day 
 we end up with a list of about 8 or so things to try to order them by risk 
 we even manage to find two of the same model drives from the <unk> downstairs to look at 
 by early afternoon i think we 've learned what we can and i call the customer 
 i tell him i 'll try it but it 's <unk> 
 he describes an office in pure chaos and says they are willing to take the risk 
 i tell him i 'm going to charge $ 75 / hour for my time successful or not to which he agrees 
 i also tell him to bring in any other dells they purchased as the same time as the broken one as i want more drives from the same batch if possible 
 my boss prints out a unique addendum to our usual <unk> all customers sign something to protect us from the consequences of potentially likely destroying this data and the other pc drives as well 
 guy shows up 15 minutes later with sweat on his <unk> and three more <unk> dells 
 we 're lucky the serial numbers on these drives are close enough be the same batch as the broken one 
 these are a better match than the drives we already found 
 so we now have the one failed drive and three good ones 
 i go shopping to pick up items needed for the potential data recovery methods 
 i purchase some dry ice a couple of <unk> bits and <unk> screwdriver to fit <unk> bags and <unk> gloves from a <unk> shop 
 i try to make arrangements with a buddy who works in a chip fabrication plant to use their clean room if needed 
 that was impossible but he was able to get me a couple of those dust free bunny suits and face <unk> 
 unfortunately they were pink 
 but this was war so i did not complain 
 the first thing i try is swapping the pcb between a good drive and the failed one 
 the good drive works fine with the failed drive 's pcb but the opposite is not true 
 next we tried putting the drive in a usb <unk> and plastic bags and cooling the drive with the dry ice 
 after 1/2 hour we tried again again without success 
 i then tried powering the drive and kinda spinning it back and forth hoping to jump start the motor or something 
 needless to say that was not working 
 we needed to open the drive up and see what secrets might be inside 
 we took apart one of the three good drives to see if it was even possible to do a platter swap 
 i 've taken apart many drives and knew the most difficult part would be not damaging the heads 
 sometimes you have to remove the arms holding the heads to even get the platter out 
 but luck was on our side 
 the arm in these particular drives could be pushed down and would not get in the way when we pulled the platters 
 even better they smoothly went back onto the platters without hanging when you carefully pushed it back 
 i dawned the bunny suit much to the delight of the other nerds and took the drive and tools into the bathroom 
 i set an <unk> playing and started <unk> wall to ceiling with wet <unk> to collect all the dust i could 
 i taped over the air vent and along the door frame 
 then i collected hot water into a trash can and added the dry ice 
 that much dry ice in that small room made quite a bit of fog which supposedly helps bring any dust out of the air 
 i do n't know if this actually works but i was concerned about adding that much <unk> into a small sealed room 
 i made it a point to hold my breath if i was reaching down to the floor 
 after the fog was gone i noticed no ill effects and proceeded to phase 3. the actual platter swap went without incident and hardly <unk> description in this story 
 just a few screws and <unk> <unk> rings 
 i just tried to line up the two platters so they were <unk> the same way relative to each other in the new case 
 obviously i could not get nearly the same level of <unk> at the physical scale of the data on the drive but i did the best i could 
 we held our breath while we booted up the bench pc with a linux data recovery live cd 
 it found the drive 
 i started to read an image from the drive which seemed to work fine 
 i did a typical data recovery on the image and i found files 
 i actually recovered that data 
 the customer was thrilled and did n't blink an eye at the bill something like $ <unk> or the fact we destroyed the other drives in the other pcs 
 i even got a $ 100 tip for risking <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of my peers 
 that evening we had pizza and mountain dew paid for out of the register 
 i kicked butt at counter strike 
 my wife called to say my mother in law was not able to visit after all 
 it was the perfect <unk> tale from awhile back 
 i was relatively fresh on senior staff 
 senior staff and management have access to a pretty great albeit arcane tool that lets us essentially enable or disable any box while completely bypassing the billing system 
 while extremely handy for troubleshooting its a <unk> for abuse in the wrong hands 
 therefore everything we do with it is thoroughly logged 
 but that 's just it it 's *only* logged 
 nobody checks these logs unless something comes up 
 back then something came up 
 at the time we were trying something new when it came to office parties 
 it being overwhelmingly men and sales csr overwhelmingly women we came up with the creative idea of having 'joint csr parties 
 great idea that works to this day but there was *this* incident 
 a <unk> frontline guy i knew had a pretty sweet girlfriend with an odd <unk> 
 she 's young very young 
 legal in canada *at the <unk> age of consent laws changed since but their age gap was already <unk> <unk> 
 still none of my business 
 this guy 's manager was well over 10 years older than him and at our first 'joint csr party he hit on his young girlfriend and stuff ensued 
 the story only became official <unk> talk material two months later when she was officially ... pregnant 
 my frontline coworker was losing his mind here crying during his breaks and i soon learned the details 
 his manager was always a bit shady but damn he was more than old enough to be his girlfriend 's father 
 thing i knew though was that he almost got fired once by direction for giving shady discounts to some members of his extended family 
 since he was n't in my good graces after i heard about all this and on a hunch i decided to check his internal tools logs 
 i discovered fifteen <unk> modems and just as many cable boxes with <unk> profiles aka full access to everything and unlimited speeds and <unk> data usage 
 no related accounts just a series of mac addresses that were n't linked to anything 
 that blatant theft of service was already more than enough to get him fired but just to be sure i put our horrible <unk> password offender status to good use and read his emails 
 and yep 
 he 's actually got evidence in his private mailbox that he 's been giving <unk> to his family 
 now i was already pissed about the cheating with a girl too young to know what 's up but being stupid enough to so <unk> steal service through support tools *really* made me angry 
 that 's the kind of thing that could make us all lose access to tools we need to get things done 
 was n't particularly interested in being officially involved in all this though 
 so i just took the relevant logs showing he 's <unk> his family along with email evidence logged in into an untraceable <unk> account and printed them on all corporate printers 
 *all* corporate printers 
 yeah i wasted paper i apologize to the dead <unk> 
 he lasted <unk> hours 
 reader is free to determine if he deserved it either for <unk> abuse of emergency technical tools or just being that dumb 
 personally at the time i deemed he was guilty on all three <unk> 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 i am a semi retired semi burnt out old tech who left support in the big city to spend my declining years in a small country town helping small business home users and the occasional <unk> 
 in spite of the fact that i left the city over 11 years ago i still get a cry for help from the big smoke australian for city this one came from a favorite client a silk '' or queens counsel 
 for those of you not from <unk> he was a lawyer and a very senior one at that 
 he had just moved on from his aging blackberry after many years of being prodded by his wife who was an apple <unk> he now had a shiny fruit phone that he was rapidly growing fond of 
 after a couple of calls when he asked a few simple how to type questions he was very happy with the new phone till a couple of weeks later when i got a panicked phone call 
 qc : <unk> there is something wrong with my phone i am missing calls it does n't ring anymore 
 should i return it '' 
 mw : hmmm qc look on the side of the phone remember i told you how to turn the ring off so you wont be disturbed in court 
 is the mute switch on '' 
 qc : oh ... .. mw you know that i deal with the criminal <unk> on a daily basis 
 and that i could engage any number of people to ensure your silence '' 
 mw : yes '' qc : i trust that you are going to be discreet and not tell my wife about this i would n't hear the end of it '' 
 i promised to remain silent forever and that his wife would n't learn of it from me provided the account was settled promptly 
 we both laughed 
 a few days later i received a small <unk> box in the mail that included a cheque a bottle of <unk> master <unk> collection <unk> and a note that read as agreed '' 
 i love a client with a sense of humour 
 edit : words <unk> call i received this morning 
 i 'm in texas so please read his dialogue in a texas accent think bill <unk> that 's pretty close it like fifty times funnier 
 & gt q : thank you for calling computer company this is q how can i help you 
 & gt x : hello 
 yeah i 'm in some kind of pickle here i was wondering if you could sort me out 
 & gt q : well i 'll see what i can do sir how can i help you today 
 & gt x : you see my computer was running slow and my wife thought it may have been because of the dust 
 & gt q : well dust can disrupt your system if it 's bad enough but i 'm sure it 's probably just -- - & gt x : now now son let me get to it 
 wait ... that 's not the problem 
 alright 
 so this woman decided ... for whatever reason between heaven hell and high water ... to put the god damn laptop ... in the dishwasher 
 utter silent shock on my end you there son 
 & gt q : yes sir i am 
 do you mind if i put you on hold just for a moment 
 & gt x : yep that 'd be fine 
 & gt q : hold run to bathroom laugh until i cry go back to my desk take a deep breath take off hold ok. wow that does sound like quite the predicament sir 
 but there might still be a chance that the hard drive is still ok and we might be able to retrieve your files its very <unk> but it is possible 
 & gt x : oh no she pulled the hard drive 
 & gt q : well thats good because -- & gt x : nope son let me get to it 
 silent anticipation you see this bag of hammers ... pulled the hard drive ... and put it on the top rack to make god damn sure it got clean 
 stunned silence i know you there son i can hear you breathing 
 & gt q : i ... um wow uh ... & gt x : now i normally do n't allow people to laugh at me or my problems but this ai n't exactly normal 
 so you go on ahead 
 both of us just <unk> with laughter & gt q : that is quite the pickle mr x 
 & gt x : so anyway you got any dishwasher safe laptops for sale 
 best ... call ... <unk> this mother & amp high school daughter just came in my shop 
 daughter had been working on a 24 page document for the past few weeks it 's due in 2 days 
 she had it saved in four parts different files but now 3 of the files are empty 
 word reports 0 words in the file 
 the only file that has anything is the first one which is 8 pages 
 to me it looked like a blank file had been saved overwriting the <unk> file 
 no she says just no 
 it 's <unk> her brother was playing a game on it 
 i said show me how you opened the file '' 
 she goes to a search box types in microsoft word opens it clicks <unk> as and selects her 8 page document 
 i said wait you 're about to ... '' - i know what i 'm doing ok 
 replace all contents yes i 'm sure then she says see 
 this stupid computer is <unk> my work '' i went back through it with her 
 see that blank document you have open 
 well you are overwriting your files with it when you are using save as '' 
 well how do i open my <unk> then 
 click open '' i respond 
 see that part where it says replace all contents 
 that 's what it means 
 she left <unk> had another client we offer besides office pcs the possibility of building you a gaming pc 
 here in mexico pc components have their prices <unk> up to <unk> % which is a huge <unk> for <unk> users and gamers to get a good system yet if you can give us time we 'll build you a powerful system 
 i had a client $ gamerdad that came asking my boss and co-worker if he could get an imac for gaming so i got to step in since it 's usually my area 
 & gt $ me : good afternoon señor and welcome to taco-mputerstore how may we help you 
 & gt $ gamerdad : greetings i need you to give me the cost of a gaming apple device 
 & gt $ me : a gaming apple 
 well that is going to be a bit hard what are you planning to play with it 
 & gt $ gamerdad : well me and my son are fans of world of warcraft counter strike lol planet side and war thunder amd since our laptop broke we need a better machine 
 & gt $ me : well sir i 'm afraid the normal macs ca n't run those games the specs and os simply would n't allow it 
 & gt $ gamerdad : i still would like to see them since many say they are the best machines you can buy 
 & gt $ me : in a few ways yes but very expensive would you like to see the catalog 
 & gt $ gamerdad : well i ... just give me the price of your best model 
 i pull out our catalog with all the models we have and when i was on imac page he points at one & gt $ gamerdad : this one it has a 5k display and one of those <unk> 9 cards so he knows basics : o & gt $ me : that is correct señor but with shipping costs it will be $ <unk> dollars <unk> mxn 
 & gt $ gamerdad : oh ... that is going to be expensive 
 my boss approached us 
 $ elboss : señor do n't buy an imac we 've received many complaints and <unk> to refund them since they are useless for games and whatever software they ask you at college 
 well he 's right we are sick of people yelling at us for having selling them something that does n't work for them when only 5 % of people here have access to an iphone and not precisely the last generations 
 not to mention the apple providers have been jerks to us due to these complaints 
 & gt $ me : he 's right señor for a <unk> of this price tag we can build you a pc battle tank 
 we engaged in a long conversation but we were discussing the specs he can have he told us about the monitor they already have and a few other things 
 i pulled out a paper and pen and start to write down 
 & gt $ me : so we can get you a <unk> <unk> for $ <unk> $ <unk> mxn an i5 <unk> processor for only $ <unk> $ <unk> mxn that we have on discount 8gb ram for $ 100 $ <unk> ... the final price tag was only $ <unk> $ <unk> mxn & gt $ me : and now we have a battle tank of a computer no matter what you <unk> at it & gt $ gamerdad : let me get a moment to think 
 he walked around the store made a few calls and finally decided to give us the <unk> 
 & gt $ gamerdad : i really want to keep playing so let 's do it 
 my boss charged the costs to his credit card and i started working on the computer took me a few hours to get it running as a gift we gifted them led fans since they were only a few dollars more expensive 
 so hours later father and son come pick it up brand new pc build his son gave us all a very happy handshake 
 & gt $ me : your father built for you one hell of a pc you can even play at 4k with this beast 
 & gt $ son : woah thank you dad 
 and thank you people as well 
 after a bit of conversation they left i received a small bonus for my work 
 enough for me still doing my best to save cash and move on from my gt <unk> let 's hope i can eventually get a better card but for now let 's keep helping clients and <unk> a year back a good friend of mine worked at my university 's it help desk where students could come with computer issues 
 between classes i would often come over to hang out with him and other people working there that i knew from our uni 's computer club 
 most issues people wanted help with were usually pretty easy to fix things internet problems viruses and malware changed settings and broken hardware which we do n't offer support for but usually help troubleshoot 
 sometimes something more serious like a shot os 
 on a somewhat busy day this guy suddenly storms in with a huge desktop tower 
 now usually people came in with laptops phones and tablets so we were all a little taken by surprise 
 he slams it on the counter and explains that he just built it the day before and it does n't want to turn on 
 my friend asks me if i would take a look at it with him since i can get quite enthusiastic about self built desktops 
 we open it up and i immediately notice that this guy did not mess around as the <unk> <unk> and the asus <unk> motherboard spring into view immediately 
 we bring over a monitor mouse and keyboard 
 plug everything in and hit the power button 
 nothing 
 we tried it one more time and wrote down the error code on the motherboard 
 a quick google search revealed that something was wrong with the processor 
 we double checked all the cables made sure the psu was strong enough to power the rig and even plugged in a spare psu we had lying around all with the same result 
 we tell him that it looks like that his cpu might be faulty and i ask if i can detach the cooler to take a look at the cpu itself 
 maybe it is physically damaged 
 he agrees and as i screw off the <unk> i immediately notice that there is no thermal paste underneath it 
 i point this out to him and ask if when he started it for the first time it did turn on but then killed the cpu due to it overheating 
 he replies that he is 100 % sure he applied the thermal paste 
 i show him that there was nothing i between the cooler and the cpu itself and ask him were he put the thermal paste 
 turns out he put it on the wrong side of the processor and probably <unk> up and bent the socket pins 
 we ended up giving him the contact support information from the mobo retailer and manufacturer and then sending him on his way 
 tl dr : dude comes into it help desk with a self built desktop that wo n't turn on 
 turns out he put the thermal paste on the wrong side of the cpu 
 this happened a few years ago when i worked at a small web design firm 
 because we were so small us designers would sometimes take to the phones and offer support for our clients 
 it could be anything from explaining why something was n't working to giving them support on a <unk> 
 a bit of back story to this call 
 we had a new client who we had just completed a total <unk> for 
 new website logo company colours fliers 
 the works 
 it looked awesome except for one thing 
 the client insisted on us keeping an animated <unk> of a little guy waving a flag 
 whatever 
 her money 
 i get a call one day after she received the <unk> fliers and 500 business cards that we had <unk> and had printed for her 
 i think you can figure where this is going : & gt client : hi i received the cards and fliers today 
 there is a problem with the printing 
 & gt me : that 's not good 
 can you let me know what it is and i can get onto the printing company to sort it out for you 
 & gt client : sure 
 the <unk> man on the logo 
 he is n't animated like on the website 
 he 's still 
 & gt me : <unk> & gt client : hello 
 i said the little man is n't moving like on the site 
 that 's what i wanted the same as on the site 
 & gt me : <unk> ahh.. <unk> <unk> you do realise that having the little man move is n't possible ... 
 & gt client : why not 
 & gt me : because it is a printed picture 
 on paper 
 & gt client : but it moves on the website and it is just a picture there 
 & gt me : um i do n't know what to say that 's not how it works 
 i 'll pass you to my supervisor 
 she genuinely could n't figure out why the <unk> was n't moving on printed paper 
 i was completely lost for words 
 edit : words 
 also 
 front page 
 this is my first post to hit it 
 i guess i 'm like internet famous now 
 i 'll work on my thank you speech 
 edit 2 : <unk> ... my <unk> call center i work at <unk> to the employees for our company 
 we help with anything from troubleshooting hardware at the warehouse to error messages from sites that we support 
 one of the sites we support is for the employees to be able to access their <unk> banking info <unk> etc 
 and for the most part the most challenging bit about it is trying to navigate to the damn thing 
 i can relate 
 i can empathize 
 but design issues are out of my hands 
 my caller lady in question was having problems with her password 
 sounded easy enough 
 i 'd dealt with many similar calls in the past 
 if only i 'd known what i did now 
 <unk> past self just hang up that call right 
 now 
 * it started out with the normal routine 
 got her employee number her warehouse number and name 
 & gt she told me i just got transferred to this number and i just want to access my time card 
 i 've signed in and everything and i ca n't get my time card '' 
 & gt '' so you were able to sign into the main site just fine '' 
 i asked to confirm 
 & gt '' yes '' 
 she says 
 i find out that to access the time card you actually have to sign in again 
 <unk> whatever 
 design choice is a little annoying but we all have to deal right 
 so i tell her to use the same login info that she did originally to get into the site 
 & gt she tells me it 's *not* working 
 i *just* changed my password 
 why is this not working '' 
 i do n't know lady 
 you tell me 
 of course i try to keep as polite as possible 
 asked her to verify her username 
 asked her if her keyboard has the caps lock on 
 is the <unk> lock on 
 you know the usual 
 & gt '' there 's nothing wrong with my computer 
 i just got this mac it 's a $ 3,000 computer 
 there 's *nothing wrong with my computer* '' um ... ok. & gt at this point i can hear her frustration <unk> 
 are they doing this on purpose '' 
 she says 
 & gt '' doing what '' 
 i asked not knowing what i was in for 
 & gt '' they 're blocking me from my time card 
 they are n't allowed to do that 
 that 's <unk> 
 they 're doing this on purpose 
 i wo n't stand for this '' 
 oh 
 my 
 god 
 i do n't know what the proper response is 
 i try to <unk> her that the company would n't do something like that 
 i try to kindly tell her that <unk> she <unk> her credentials or password 
 & gt she shuts me down 
 no 
 i *just* changed my password 
 i know what my password is '' 
 ok time for plan b. i ask her to try to log out and try and change her password again 
 she is adamant against it 
 she pushes eager to take whatever is left of my patience and crush it from existence 
 & gt '' i do n't want to change my password again '' 
 at this point i am desperate to get out of this call 
 i login via my own username and password 
 everything works fine 
 i log into my time card 
 damn thing works fine on my end 
 i tell her that this does n't seem to be an issue with the <unk> 
 a nice way of telling her that it is user error from *her* end 
 & gt she tells me no 
 no 
 no 
 that 's with your user that it works with ok 
 that 's not my username '' 
 somehow i manage to convince her to change her password again 
 i wait in silence while she goes through the process 
 a part of me wished that she offered to call us back while she did this 
 i normally start up small talk but i frankly did n't care at this point 
 she resets the password 
 she tries to login again 
 it says username/password incorrect '' 
 <unk> end my suffering now 
 * she is not pleased 
 & gt '' why is it saying this now 
 what ... what did you <unk> to my username 
 you <unk> it '' 
 **oh 
 hell 
 no 
 ** this accusation throws me off 
 i try to tell her that this username should be the same i did nothing 
 *nothing 
 * she is still convinced i am guilty 
 & gt she mentions to me i have a witness to this conversation you know 
 my friend has been watching me talk with you this entire time '' 
 why is this happening to me 
 she starts muttering profanities about the site 
 she continues to blame me 
 i decide it is time to talk to one of our specialists for help 
 i walk a bit too fast 
 when i come to him i almost trip over myself in relief when i explain the situation and he offers to take the call from me 
 my only regret is that i did n't come to him sooner 
 i come back to the caller ready to let go ... <unk> to find she is not quite done with me 
 & gt after i tell her that someone else is going to take the call she asks wait a minute what 's your name '' 
 i hate it when they do this 
 <unk> i give her my entire name 
 i spell out my last name 
 she tells me to slow down 
 & gt i try to spell it again and then she finally says ok. you know 
 you need to speak more clearly ok 
 i have been more than patient with you this entire call 
 this is the least i deserve '' 
 i 'm sorry ... <unk> 
 ** i 'm seething 
 but then i speak more slowly 
 she is finally able to write down my info 
 i park the call 
 my specialist picks up the call 
 i sigh in relief at this finally being over and chat the ticket number to my specialist to look over my troubleshooting steps 
 at this time i take my much needed break 
 i end up taking a walk to a <unk> area and crying 
 i start worrying that i 'll be in trouble and she 'll report me 
 i was n't thinking clearly 
 <unk> this is not where it ends 
 * when i return from my break my specialist is walking over to me 
 *oh <unk> i think 
 except then he has me sit down and talks with me 
 & gt '' she was rude to me too 
 started <unk> and giving me a hard time '' 
 oh my god 
 & gt he continues 
 so i put her on hold and called her warehouse and talked to the administrator on duty '' 
 he tells me that he told him about her behavior 
 he found that this woman is not a model employee 
 she 's pulled this kind of behavior before 
 he tells me that he would like me to make a summary of everything that happened and send him the email and cc our supervisor and our manager 
 he makes sure i think none of this is my fault and tells me that the warehouse is going to look into writing her up 
 *i could die of happiness 
 * i could have been satisfied with just that ... but then half an hour later my specialist comes back 
 & gt '' she called back '' 
 he tells me with a grin 
 oh 
 & gt '' what happened '' 
 & gt she was much nicer this time to the person who answered '' 
 pft 
 of course 
 and then he tells me 
 & gt '' they found out she was fat <unk> and she did n't type in her password correctly this whole time '' 
 yup 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> : thank you to everyone who has been responding i did n't anticipate my story picking up like this 
 i usually do n't frequent reddit so i 'm sorry that i 'm not able to respond to everyone 
 i 'm going to read through everyone 's comments though 
 thank you for the advice and encouragement this experience has been ... interesting 
 by the way i got a couple emails recently from the user 's admin and gm <unk> for her behavior and saying that they are personally speaking with her about it 
 nothing further than that but i think at this point i 'm not really angry about it anymore 
 also a few of my co workers who sit near me gave me some chocolate hugs and some of the more senior <unk> told me some more user horror stories which made me feel much better 
 this did n't happen directly to me but it did happen to my supervisor at my old job 
 he 's told me enough stories over the years between his many different jobs prior to it that i can safely say that this is a true story 
 * let 's call my old boss $ oldboss 
 * let 's call his supervisor $ powertrip 
 * let 's call the new guy $ whiteintern 
 one friday like any other friday $ oldboss throws a weekly full backup tape inside each of the three servers left in his small data center a large reel into his vax dropped off last week 's backup tapes at the building next door and walks down the block to the local burger joint for a beer and the burger special 
 then he heads home 
 it had been a <unk> week at work 
 $ oldboss had to fight with $ powertrip about data center improvements that $ powertrip implemented without consulting him 
 initially it was things that were a major improvement : <unk> on all doors coming into the offices and a new kick ass door for the data center 
 there had been some small <unk> in the office and keys were no longer trusted even after all of the locks were changed 
 the installers had tons of issues installing this crazy data center door because the building was so old and used huge <unk> blocks about 3 feet thick and the data center was in the basement 
 this building could probably <unk> a <unk> 
 the door installers were instructed to keep the room safe from <unk> and water no matter the cost so the door was sealed on all sides and damn near <unk> 
 $ oldboss loved this but as soon as it was done $ powertrip decided to have the sprinkler system extended into the data center as well 
 $ oldboss flipped out over the idea of having water rushing above very expensive equipment but $ powertrip basically told him : it 's not your data center it 's $ powertrip 's data center 
 and i 'll do whatever i think is best for it 
 $ oldboss you 're just my <unk> that shows up to keep it in shape and i pay you 1/4 of my salary so that you keep your <unk> mouth shut '' 
 $ oldboss told me that it took every fiber in his body to not hit the man let alone keep his mouth shut 
 he did however go to hr the next day and report the issue 
 it was dismissed without any reason given to him and since he was n't in the union with the rest of the employees he had little power 
 he told me that he decided to stick with the company because they were paying him well the job was stable normally and his daughter was getting a discount at the local college 
 after all family does come before happiness sometimes and $ oldboss simply looked at it as a place where he could get paid for the next few years until his daughter graduated 
 only 3 years to begin a job search and network with other people 
 compared to his other previous jobs which were much more dangerous this desk job was a <unk> 
 over the next few years he had few <unk> with $ powertrip but they did what they were required to do and avoided each other 
 one thing that $ oldboss did regularly that really pissed off $ powertrip was to request environmental monitoring equipment for the data center 
 now that there were new ac units added as well as the sprinkler systems he wanted <unk> monitoring equipment as well as the noise sensors and flood detection systems 
 compared to other projects this one was cheap 
 but $ powertrip looked at it as a reason that $ oldboss was trying to throw him under the bus : * $ powertrip : why do we need this equipment again '' 
 * $ oldboss : because there are a few sources of water and moisture in that room now and we did n't put these sensors in the room back when we added those water sources '' 
 * $ powertrip : so ... you 're saying that i made a mistake 
 i do n't make mistakes i fix them 
 having this meeting with you was a mistake 
 i 'll talk it over with the bosses '' 
 $ oldboss would send an inter-office memo to $ powertrip ever year or so with the same proposal <unk> <unk> each time but apparently the damage had already been done 
 it was returned to him denied every year with the same reason every time : i do n't make mistakes '' written every time on the project approval notes form 
 finally $ oldboss 's daughter was due up for graduating 
 the discounted education and the money they both contributed meant that she never had to worry about <unk> and her education was fully paid off 
 she was going to be graduating in only a few weeks 
 $ oldboss planned on leaving in the next few months but figured he better follow rule # 1 just one more time : cya cover your ass 
 $ oldboss found a new job that was going to pay a ton more and told them that he 'd need 4 weeks notice to hand over the reigns and give all of the proper info to the next guy 
 so he sent the inter-office memo one last time to $ powertrip for the environmental sensors project who responded with a nasty <unk> note saying to never question him again or he 'd be fired 
 needless to say he went upstairs put in his 2 weeks notice to a stunned $ powertrip went to hr and got his paperwork in order and took the rest of the day off as sick 
 the last 2 weeks at this job had absolutely no interaction between $ oldboss and $ powertrip except on the final day when $ powertrip had $ oldboss escorted out by police officers and all access codes to the doors were promptly changed 
 $ oldboss had met his replacement that same day some <unk> kid who he would have gladly hired as an intern but not someone to replace him 
 he went off to his new job where everyone loved and respected him and his pay went up about $ <unk> in the first year due to the major improvements he implemented 
 he was as happy as he could be 
 but then the <unk> happened a few years later 
 nobody knows exactly how it started but the fire marshal concluded that the vax <unk> printer apparently caught fire for some reason and probably lit the many large boxes of paper next to it 
 the closest sprinkler went off and it kept <unk> water 
 keep in mind the following : 1. this data center is in the basement 
 2. it is now a sealed room ever since the insane door was installed 
 3. the walls are not drywall but <unk> thick stone blocks 
 on all sides 
 4. all cables ran out of the data center ceiling into the maintenance room directly above them 
 5. there is nowhere for this water to go but up or through a $ 10,000 <unk> door that is n't moving the ceiling in the room was about 12 feet above 
 the water did n't reach the ceiling but it did go up roughly 7 feet ... apparently someone at the nightly guard desk stopped the system when the generic building alarm went off 
 however since the office had keypad access installed in the last few years none of the guards had ever needed to get into it during the night 
 the night guard could have probably called the head of the cleaning crew of the locksmith but it was 2am on a saturday 
 what 's the worst that could happen 
 monday rolls around and the intern replacement is called in early since vax is n't working '' 
 he tries to open the vault but ca n't 
 he calls the locksmith who takes one look at the vault said says i did n't install this <unk> thing 
 call that company 
 by this time it 's 10am and the many employees at this office are flipping out and execs are pulling their hair out 
 intern decides to go up to the maintenance closet and he peers down into the cable run hole and he goes white 
 you 're not supposed to go full white but he did 
 he ran to $ powertrip whose office had become a war room of sorts for the execs since he was in charge of the it department 
 i was told the conversation went like this : * $ whiteintern : hey um quick question $ powertrip ... .do we have any environmental sensors in the data center '' 
 * $ powertrip : not this **** again 
 why is n't the system up and running yet slacker 
 get the **** out of here and fix it '' 
 * $ whiteintern : *in a pissed off tone* you 're not paying me enough for this so i 'll just say it 
 the data center is filled with water and looks like a <unk> pool 
 all of your equipment is now scrap '' 
 everyone in the room freaked out all at once 
 it was disorder as everyone implemented cya policy and the finger was immediately pointed at $ powertrip who was lost for a few seconds but quickly found someone to blame 
 * $ powertrip : get the police on the phone 
 i know who did this '' 
 * $ whiteintern : who did this '' 
 * $ powertrip : obviously it 's $ oldboss getting back at me 
 i bet he did this '' 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - $ oldboss 's new job was only a few blocks away and he was busy enjoying his monday morning with the free donuts that management would bring in at the beginning of every week 
 he was looking at a promotion to management and had his feet kicked up on his desk when he heard a commotion at the front desk 
 he looks out from behind his office door and sees a few executives from his old company standing there shouting for him 
 $ oldboss gets up walks over and then notices purple-faced $ powertrip being the primary <unk> 
 oh god '' was his only though 
 * $ powertrip : here he is 
 you 
 you terrible person 
 you 're coming with us and you 're going to rot in jail after the police get to you 
 either come with us now or we 'll have the cops come over here '' 
 * $ oldboss : what in the hell is going on 
 what are you talking about 
 i 'm not going anywhere '' 
 * $ powertrip : you flooded the data center to get back at me you <unk> <unk> '' * $ oldboss : i what 
 you ... <unk> ... .you know what 
 yea i 'll come with you '' 
 they walk him down to the old building where police have already begun an inspection and the fire marshal was setting up pumps to get rid of the water 
 everyone of any importance was there : head of hr security guards every executive and all eyes looked at him as soon as $ oldboss walked into the room 
 the glares were piercing 
 the cops did n't know that $ powertrip had done this and were in the process of telling him that he should n't have done this when $ oldboss says : * $ oldboss : i 'd like to make a statement 
 right now 
 in front of everyone '' 
 * $ police : that can wait until we 're ... '' * $ oldboss : nope this needs to be done now 
 i 've been enjoying my new job for about 4 years now and i 'd like to get back to it as soon as possible 
 $ hr-sally if you 'll note that before i left in my record i gave you every inter-office memo i ever had with $ powertrip explaining why we needed environmental monitoring and his reasons for denying them 
 can you read them aloud '' 
 * $ hr-sally : let me find them here ... ... ... .um ... <unk> <unk> expensive 'i do n't make mistakes 'i do n't make mistakes and 'i do n't make mistakes and i 'll fire you next time you bring this up 
 * $ oldboss : thank you sally 
 and you 'll note that despite my extensive knowledge of the equipment and what was needed that my boss does n't make mistakes and he did n't feel that this was needed '' 
 * $ powertrip : i know you must have started the fire '' 
 * $ oldboss : actually i was away with the ceo of my new company all weekend where he offered me a raise and a management position 
 i can call him down here if you 'd like '' 
 upper management apologized to $ oldboss and let him leave at the loud protest of $ powertrip 
 he did n't get to see what happened next 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - less than a week later he got a call to please come back to the old office at 9am by the guy that runs the company 
 you ca n't really ignore that call so he went back 
 * $ oldboss : you wanted to see me $ bigboss '' 
 * $ bigboss : we just started trying to figure out how to start over here and i realized that none of us have any idea what we 're doing 
 how would you like to come back to the company 
 * $ oldboss : there 's no way in hell ... '' * $ bigboss : we fired $ powertrip as soon as you left the room last week and escorted him out of the building for gross <unk> of company property as we had never heard about this environmental monitoring plan that you <unk> 
 in fact i 'm not offering you your old position as the guy that replaced you is one of my <unk> 
 i 'm offering you $ powertrip 's old position as our management head for it 
 with an increase from what he was getting paid '' 
 $ oldboss was actually thinking of retirement in a few years but this was too good to pass up 
 * $ oldboss : when do you want me to start '' 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - in the end $ oldboss took the job and spent the next few years training $ whiteintern as best as he could and along the way they happily worked on many projects together and hired many underlings as it was becoming more and more popular with the other departments 
 i was one of the many underlings underneath $ whiteintern that were hired to implement the new data center 
 this story is definitely one of my favorites despite it taking a long time to tell because it hits nearly some important rules in it : 1. cover your ass 
 all of the time 
 2. do a good job 
 3. do n't burn bridges 
 4. have a data recovery plan storage area for <unk> and tapes was a separate building and everything was moved over there at the end of every week 
 5. listen to those under you beside you and above you 
 in it there are a million ways to get something done and your way might not be the best way 
 at his retirement party i remember that $ bigboss gave $ oldboss a <unk> cup full of vodka but with a little metal data center in the bottom of it someone made for him 
 probably the best going away present anyone could <unk> was a few years ago but it was embarrassing 
 taco-mputerstore sells your normal stuff you need to build and maintain pcs all of it hanging in the wall behind the main counter for clients to see including of course our dear thermal paste 
 we were attending a few clients when suddenly a police truck stand in front of the store and a couple of <unk> and a dog came in through the door my boss reached for them 
 & gt $ elboss : officers how may i help you 
 & gt officer : señor we received reports that your store is suspicious of selling illegal <unk> 
 me and the other two guys were shocked the policeman with the dog came behind the counter and started sniffing around i did n't do much except lean <unk> the counter and let them through 
 & gt $ elboss : what 
 we do n't sell those things we sell computer and computer accessories 
 & gt $ officer : we 'll see about that 
 the officer with the dog reached for the <unk> of thermal paste then hand it over at the other one i tried to contain my laugh since we had joked how the <unk> looked like <unk> 
 & gt officer : <unk> the <unk> what is this 
 & gt elboss : that is called thermal <unk> paste or <unk> it 's for connecting some parts of computers to the <unk> surfaces that <unk> heat so the pc 's do n't <unk> and die 
 not exactly the best description but a good <unk> he has used before 
 the officer opened it up and gave it a <unk> then the dog sniffed it as well no reaction we were allowed to open youtube and show him some videos of it 's use 
 they spent about 30 minutes searching the store and the back of it they found nothing of course 
 & gt $ officer : sorry for the bother we got an anonymous call that your store was selling heroine false alarm our apologies 
 he signed some papers and later they left good times 
 tl dr : thermal paste is <unk> work for a small computer repair shop we deal with people whose computers have no warranty people who want their tech support a bit cheaper 
 as such we get some pretty crazy calls and people 
 i 'd like to share one today 
 caller : '' i 've got a problem with my computer 
 it 's telling me to buy a pet snake and i do n't want one '' me : thinking it 's a virus alright sir are you trying to reach a specific website and it is redirecting you asking you to buy a pet snake '' 
 caller : no 
 every time i click this stupid file it asks me to go out and buy a snake then try again '' 
 me : '' alright sir can you read back the exact error message '' 
 caller : yeah it says <unk> required to run script '' me : ... sir i 'm going to put you on hold for a few seconds '' 
 commence laughter including tears 
 my co-workers stared at me 
 i walked him through the process of installing python then showed the call to my manager who regretted not being on the line when the call was made 
 edit : wow <unk> 
 thank you to everyone 
 <unk> be sure to post more stories as they occur 
 edit edit : <unk> boy 
 one more edit : 3,000 people holy <unk> in the it sector have upvoted this 
 i ca n't express how grateful i am nor did i ever think i 'd get so many 
 but before this turns in what sounds like an acceptance speech i was thinking of starting a theory list as to how this happened in the first place 
 i 'll list the direct <unk> and whom they came from 
 if someone wants to add a theory or <unk> one feel free 
 mine and my manager 's theory : the caller had a tech-savvy son who had copied over a python script to the dad 's computer which did n't have python and was planning on installing it but forgot to or something 
 dad clicked on file and got suspicious 
 <unk> theory : bitcoin will give you <unk> for basically acting as a proxy for their transaction network essentially converting electricity into bitcoin 
 before the bitcoin boom and crash it was pretty common for <unk> to install the necessary software on all the computers in the house to increase cash flow 
 i even saw a guy take like 20 <unk> <unk> and convert them into a bitcoin strip mine '' just having them run the proxy software 
 <unk> theory : what it probably was an application that was a <unk> for the script and it could run without <unk> but it would n't be able to launch the script <unk> theory : does n't python have a portable version 
 maybe he was just drag and dropping it onto a portable version 
 <unk> theory : there are python scripts for cracking wep encryption 
 maybe he downloaded one of those without understanding what python was 
 <unk> theory : python was probably installed but not on the path <unk> theory : i would guess mining a cpu <unk> 
 <unk> is really greek when you first get into it 
 <unk> theory : some mods for skyrim require python 
 i was working <unk> about a decade ago doing wireless networking support for a major pc manufacturer 
 i get this call at about 2am 
 it 's a woman fairly young early 20s maybe and she ca n't get on the internet 
 she is getting connected to her router wired and wirelessly but no internet 
 i walk her through some standard steps but the router is still acting kind of funky plus i think she had comcast we had a lot of trouble with them 
 finally in the troubleshooting steps we get to the point where doing a manual reset on her router is the next best step before just replacing it 
 so i told her to pick it up turn it around find that small <unk> button on the back left and use a pen to press and hold that for 10 seconds 
 after a brief silence she asks where is this hole again '' 
 on the back of your & lt brand & gt router where you plug the cables in it 's on the far left '' 
 hmm i do n't see it back here ... '' i 'd done this many many times before and i knew the mistakes customers usually made so i said move your left thumb you have it over the hole '' 
 oh ... i 'll be right back '' 
 the phone <unk> as it hits the desk and the <unk> of feet walking off in the distance can be heard 
 about 30 seconds later the footsteps are back and getting closer 
 then she picks the phone up again 
 she says ok whew i 'm ready now 
 i just had to put a <unk> on i did n't know you had cameras on these things 
 sorry for the free show 
 client runs a bunch of 24 hour convenience stores and i 'm typically the one they call when the <unk> matter hits the <unk> air impeller when the phone goes off about 20 minutes ago at 11pm here i assume it 's some kind of significant failure 
 a little quite voice goes hey <unk> can i get a favour from you 
 i 'm $ bigboss child process and friends with your daughter can you tell me how to wipe my search history really quickly 
 obviously i 'm in cya mode as she 's about 15 so immediately start recording the call just in case but i 'm not going to <unk> her out to her dad just because she might have been up to something naughty briefly 
 she want to only wipe a single set of searches and a few page <unk> from history which is <unk> to step someone through over the phone so setup a quick remote session to do it for her 
 <unk> an oh fuck '' moment because she 's researching women 's <unk> and abuse reporting <unk> and needs to hide it 
 i have a significant feeling i 'm going to be dropping this client soon 
 yes ... yes you are ... ladies and <unk> of tfts i give you another wonderful tale of users who will not listen ... and pay the price because of it 
 & amp nbsp today 's tale involves a lovely little business that shall henceforth be named $ staffingagency this business is one of our largest and most <unk> customers 
 we have a contract with them that boils down to if it 's within business hours we 've got your back '' 
 many at $ staffingagency have direct numbers to my and other technician 's cell phones as a courtesy and are a treat to deal with 
 there is that one though ... ohhhh there is that one ... every business has them 
 that employee is miss <unk> cr 
 & amp nbsp it is <unk> pm on a saturday evening when i received her call 
 i was prepping for a raid in insert favorite <unk> here and joking with friends on our voip server when i was forced to break away 
 i did n't recognize the number which unfortunately sets of a dozen red flags immediately within my mind 
 & amp nbsp & gt me : this is cyrillus '' 
 & gt cr : oh thank god someone finally answered i 've been calling the office number for an hour now '' 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry who is this '' 
 & gt cr : cr with $ staffingagency i ca n't print my report and it was due at <unk> you need to fix it '' 
 at this point i set my cell phone to record the call yay for work phones 
 & gt me : <unk> ... are there any error messages on the printer '' 
 & gt cr : no 
 can you come out here '' 
 & gt me : i could but i want to try some troubleshooting over the phone first '' 
 & gt cr : no i do n't have the time for it and i know y'all are under contract to provide on site service '' 
 & gt me : that 's only on weekdays during work hours 
 any kind of after hours or weekend work which i am *not* required to do is billable time '' 
 & gt cr : well that 's stupid '' 
 & gt me : that 's our contract ma'am i 'm willing to spend a little time troubleshooting over the phone or if i was already out near your area but i 'm at home so phone troubleshooting is my next best option '' 
 & gt cr : fine ask away '' 
 & gt me : so there are no error messages on the printer how about the pc 
 are there any error messages there 
 have you tried turning it off and on 
 have you checked for <unk> 
 have you checked to see if there is paper '' 
 & gt cr : it just wo n't print i 've tried **all** of that '' 
 & gt me : ok could you go into the control panel and tell me what you see '' 
 & gt cr : i see the printer and it says it has a document waiting '' 
 & gt me : and nothing else 
 i think y'all had a few other printers on the network that you should have listed there '' 
 & gt cr : nothing 
 look just ... how much does it cost to have you come out '' 
 & gt me : this would be under emergency rates after hours and weekend so you 're looking at $ 250 an hour ... i could also do remote support to see if maybe i could fix the issue from here that would only be a weekend rate '' 
 & amp nbsp i figured that would <unk> her or at least let me fix the issue while doing my raid prep 
 nope ... & amp nbsp & gt cr : fine 
 make the trip out here i 've got to get this report printed out before the end of the night '' 
 & amp nbsp about this time something clicked that had n't before 
 $ staffingagency had their main office in the same town i was in but they had a bunch of satellite offices scattered all over the place and i had n't ever met cr in my many trips out to the main office 
 & gt me : hey cr which office are you at again '' 
 & gt cr : i 'm at $ bigcitylocation 
 & amp nbsp i began cursing myself $ bigcitylocation was 2 and a half hours of driving away but i could n't just say 'that 's too far for a saturday night i 'd never hear the end of it come monday 
 & gt me : ok cr ... just so you know this is going to be $ 250 an hour <unk> travel <unk> 
 saturday traffic in $ <unk> is bad as i recall so i ca n't guarantee that my travel estimate will be accurate but i 'm thinking no less than a 2 hour drive '' 
 & gt cr : i 'll pay it 
 **just** 
 <unk> 
 **here** '' 
 & gt me : ok then '' 
 & amp nbsp after venting a little bit of the inconvenience to my <unk> i prep myself and begin the drive 
 it was uneventful until i reached $ <unk> where traffic became absolute hell 
 my two hour estimate turned into three 
 i finally arrived at the agency office a little building nestled in the center of the city with barely five parking spots to its lot 
 walking in the building i met cr whom quickly ushered me off to the printer 
 & amp nbsp in big bold letters on the front of the printer : **out of paper** i could n't believe it 
 i walk over to the pc and sure enough on the printer 's status screen it shows in big bold letters **out of paper** 
 i take a new ream of paper which were right beside the printer open the tray put it in and sure enough her queued report comes spitting out ... to be sure i did some additional printing checked to see if anything was worn out but it was in vain 
 the printer was perfectly fine 
 & amp nbsp cr shows up at my shoulder & gt cr : oh good you fixed it what was the problem '' 
 & gt me : it was out of paper ... it said so on the screen and on the computer '' 
 she flushed and had a look of anger as she looked down at the printer then back up to me & gt cr : and i 'm supposed to pay for that '' 
 & gt me : you agreed to the service call '' 
 & gt cr : this is going to be over a thousand dollars of billable time to have just changed a paper ream i 'm not paying that much '' 
 & amp nbsp i 'm not a very confrontational person i get nervous and hate being under pressure ... but occasionally i do snap 
 this lady interrupted my saturday evening made me miss out on an activity i greatly enjoy and only do once a week and made me fight evening traffic on one of the worst days of the week to do it 
 & gt me : you wo n't have to worry about paying me because i 'm sending the bill to your main office with a full detailing of what it is we did here today along with a recording of that phone call 
 a phone call where *i told <unk> to check the printer for any sort of error messages missing paper and so on 
 i gave you the rate the trip would be a trip i could have rightly refused to do because it is outside of our support contract but i came anyway at *your* urging '' 
 it did n't quite come out as i typed in person but i was able to calmly <unk> the meat of it and that 's more than i can usually accomplish 
 she seemed to realize she had messed up 
 her reaction as you would imagine was the same quote used for the title 
 & amp nbsp tl : dr luser could n't read requests on site support gets $ 1500 bill because of it 
 possibly fired 
 & amp nbsp **update : ** well she 's not fired but i 've been informed any troubleshooting calls from her location are now going to come through their main office first 
 they also worked out a deal with my boss to only pay half the owed bill due to how ridiculous the situation was 
 edit : clarification this satellite office had 1 pc and 1 printer that only cr used 
 the other staff were specialized staff that did n't need a pc or worked from home off a <unk> 
 you read that right 
 a user got <unk> from his job* for forgetting his password 
 before you think that 's harsh consider that the user was a medical doctor assigned patients in the critical care department 
 this is the story 
 this morning around 2am i get a call from the ccu from dr. $ <unk> saying he ca n't log into the computer 
 now we use $ <unk> that has several different components to it 
 each needing it 's own password 
 but there are three main logon credentials that you need 
 and if you are a doctor you need 1 less than normal since we use <unk> <unk> 
 normally all the physician has to do is swipe the badge in the reader and enter a <unk> 
 but they also need their badge to leave the ccu so no one really <unk> it at work and has someone else use it to access the systems 
 all the doors are rfid locked and you 're not getting anywhere without your badge 
 so once the doctor calls i ask him what he 's trying to log into and he responds with the computer '' 
 i say which application '' 
 and he said where i chart '' 
 so i say ok where do you chart '' 
 and he has the audacity to respond on the computer 
 thank you captain obvious 
 i say okay so do you use the vm or portal 
 and he said he uses the vm 
 so i remote into his computer ask him to badge the reader and enter his pin 
 it did n't work 
 i reset the pin and asked him to do it again and now it 's asking for his ad password 
 i ask him to enter his ad password to verify its him and then it will ask him to create a new 4 digit pin 
 he does n't remember his ad password so i change his password to 'password and prompt the computer to make him change it 
 the computer prompts him to change it and he enters 6 characters and hits the enter key really hard 
 the computer rejects the password because it does n't meet security protocol for a physician 
 they deal with medical records and can view <unk> on any patient in this hospital so we want this complex 
 he gets flustered and starts complaining that his password does n't work 
 i tell him that he has to have at least 8 characters one capital letter and one number 
 he says i do n't have time for this shit fix it '' 
 and hangs up the phone 
 come to find out he went in the break room and ignored his patients blaming it all on it 
 after he hung up on me i called the department director so she could maybe talk some sense into him 
 i did n't want a patient getting delayed care because a doctor ca n't come up with a password 
 but of course the patient he was caring for went into <unk> arrest because he failed to resort to paper charting and delayed patient care 
 the house supervisor found out about it and told him to leave the property immediately 
 security had to physically remove him 
 the patient is alive though 
 all is well with a new younger doctor that 's actually kind of computer savvy 
 when i created his ccu account he created a password with 12 characters and my system showed me it was high security '' 
 that 's rare 
 he probably used <unk> 
 tl dr - doctor forgot his log in information and delayed patient care 
 patient almost dies and doctor is escorted off the property 
 update : i was informed this morning that this particular doctor had a long list of previous issues with administration and failure to comply with hospital policy and procedure 
 this current incident was the last straw '' so to speak 
 update 2 : wow 
 front page <unk> quote of the day 
 that 's awesome 
 thanks guys where i work is closed thursday & amp friday for christmas 
 of the thousand or so people who work here i 'm among the remaining hundred who did n't take the week off for vacation 
 with my only work for today and tomorrow being a handful of pcs to image i <unk> stayed up later than usual last night expecting to spend most the morning <unk> through that process 
 just to spite me a ticket arrived at <unk> & gt user recently changed offices and reporting that the display on his tablet is not working 
 user powers device on and nothing happens 
 i called user and learned the tablet 's display is fine it just does n't work with the monitor when it 's docked 
 user is an engineer and since he is trusted with a $ 3000 tablet he should at least know how to plug in the two power cables and hdmi cable for his <unk> 
 my first <unk> was after the move he connected the <unk> travel power brick to the dock instead of the <unk> and the dock just was n't getting enough power 
 the bricks are roughly the same size and it happens all the time 
 user was too busy '' to read the label on his brick and verify whether that was the case or not so i grabbed a brick and some video cables and made the drive to user 's new office <unk> minutes away 
 * what i was greeted with was the dock monitor and tablet still sealed in the user 's moving box ... i looked at the box 
 i looked at the user 
 i scowled 
 the user acknowledged my scowl 
 the user attempted to explain how he had unpacked everything and it did n't work so he put it all back and <unk> the box and and ... i continued scowling 
 user <unk> i was n't buying any and excused himself from the scene 
 i unpacked and connected everything 
 it all worked fine just as it should have 
 user had a box of a dozen <unk> donuts on his desk 
 i liberated half 
 edit surprising level of interest in this one 
 no i was n't going to notify a <unk> 
 installing it equipment is part of my job so this clearly fell under it 
 i 'd have been perfectly happy to make the 30 minute drive to connect it for him if that 's what he 'd initially asked for instead of saying something was broken and putting my brain in troubleshoot mode 
 yes the donuts were delicious 
 hello all - this is my first post on this forum my colleague having only recently shown it to me 
 this story is 100 % true although i sincerely wish it was n't 
 one weekend in 2008 while on-call doing internal support for a mortgage company i get a call from a remote <unk> 
 she tells me that due to a winter storm she was working from home rather than the office today 
 as a result she 's using a desktop she has had for several years already rather than her usual laptop 
 her complaint is that it is 'slow and noisy 
 to demonstrate the noise she held the phone up to the machine 
 i <unk> that yes it was indeed <unk> audibly 
 i remoted in and could n't find anything seriously wrong with the machine aside from it was old and somewhat overwhelmed with the workload - it had 2gb of ram and was running xp with quite a lot of company <unk> bloat e.g 
 just enough memory to boot up and not much else 
 i told her there was n't much i could do about the performance but she should clean the machine out with some canned air and check for random loose parts that could be <unk> in the bottom of the machine 
 satisfied she hung up agreeing she 'd clean it out 
 20 minutes later she calls again to inform me that the machine has stopped working all together 
 nothing she could do would get it to turn back on again 
 she said it had n't worked since she cleaned it out 
 upset for her and annoyed my advice had led to the problem i sent her a shipping label to get the machine to me so i could fix it 
 when the system arrived i could not power it on either 
 i looked inside it to investigate and found a nightmare - there was literally melted plastic everywhere 
 some had dripped onto the cpu fan 
 one of the corners of the motherboard was <unk> like cheese on a tv commercial <unk> 
 immediately i called the user 
 & gt '' so this machine is a <unk> <unk> '' 
 & gt '' why 
 i did exactly as you said '' 
 & gt '' you used canned air '' 
 & gt '' i did n't have time to go to the store i just used a hairdryer '' 
 & gt '' ... you what '' 
 & gt '' you know a hairdryer 
 it blows air and it got all the dust out '' 
 & gt '' you used a hairdryer inside your desktop tower '' 
 & gt '' yeah and it scared me when it started making sparks '' 
 & gt '' you had it plugged in while you were doing that '' 
 & gt '' i never turned it off i did n't want to disconnect from the vpn '' 
 this one just happened 
 so i work as the it manager at a hotel and resort 
 our <unk> had called me to tell me one of their keyboards was n't <unk> credit cards it 's a keyboard model that has a built in credit card swipe 
 so i head down there open up notepad slide my card and sure enough nothing 
 so while i am looking at it one of the employees at the desk asks me if i 've ever seen the it crowd 
 do you ever get the urge to answer the phone and say 'hello it have you tried turning it off and back on again '' 
 i smile and tell her yes 
 then i say to her ok your keyboard is fixed '' 
 she looks surprised as they had assumed the keyboard would need replacing 
 what did you do '' 
 i look at her smiling at the irony of the situation 
 i unplugged it and plugged it back in 
 aka turned it off and back on again '' 
 she smiled and gave me a high five 
 i love easy <unk> 
 if you are <unk> to be an it tech stay the hell away from hospitals 
 that being said i get a call from an ed doctor and it goes like this : & gt me : it this is <unk> can i help you 
 doc : yes 
 this is dr. $ <unk> and this computer down here in the ed next to room 14 will not com on 
 i tried to holding the button i tried <unk> it and plugging it back in 
 nothing works 
 i have patients that need my services and my care and i am being prevented from doing my job 
 i need to get these orders in so i can get <unk> on my patient 
 me : okay 
 just go to paper charting 
 i 'm going to grab a pre-built brand new system and head that way right now 
 doc : okay because i have to get this charting done and provide for my patients 
 i have to be able to access the computers in a timely fashion 
 me : yes ma'am 
 on my way now 
 doc : okay 
 thank you 
 the thing about the computers is that they are there to assist the <unk> 
 never should a computer cause patient care delays because human beings do n't need to be rebooted and repaired as often 
 these doctors should know that if they know a patient needs $ drug they can give the patient that drug and use the forms like they did before the wonderful world of computers 
 so i get down to the ed and as i 'm rolling a cart with a brand new system on it up to the terminal there she is with her overly detailed explanation of what she has tried in terms of troubleshooting 
 the entire time my eyes are fixed on the monitor <unk> light that is <unk> <unk> and i ca n't look away 
 she finally stops talking and i walk over and <unk> the power cable into the back of the monitor in one swift motion and the monitor pops on and <unk> to life 
 i smiled at the doctor and told her merry christmas '' and walked away 
 because that 's what you do 
 you fix the issue and get the hell out of the way 
 they need to work and <unk> is not something that we do 
 we do what we need to do and move like the wind 
 once i got back in my office the house supervisor called me telling me that this particular doctor filed a complaint on me for making her look like she was stupid 
 i explained what happened what i did and what i said and the house supervisor started laughing and said oh so she <unk> <unk> stupid 
 oh the <unk> of working in a hospital 
 this story <unk> the worst service call i ever ran 
 if i had never got that job and was stuck delivering pizzas for the rest of my life i probably would have been okay with that if it meant i did n't have to deal with this 
 warning this story contains brief use of adult language reader discretion is advised it 's around quitting time friday just doing my paperwork after a surprisingly <unk> day when boss man calls me up 
 & gt boss man : new call came in high priority 
 end user from derp group says she needs her laptop serviced no <unk> n't turn on 
 think you can handle it today 
 & gt me : no problem boss man 
 so i call the end user about 5 minutes later to try and do some simple <unk> over the phone to get a better idea of the issue before i actually visit the user 
 & gt <unk> <unk> & gt end user : it 's about damn time & gt me : i 'm sorry 
 what 
 & gt end user : you <unk> the derp service tech <unk> 
 * & gt me : erm yes 
 i 'm calling with regards to your service call <unk> -- & gt end user : i do n't care what number it is just get over here 
 & gt me : ma'am i 'm more than happy to help you with this issue 
 i 'll be able to help you better if we go over some <unk> -- & gt end user : do i have to tell boss man and let him know you 're not doing your job 
 that 's right i know who your supervisor is do n't think i wo n't 
 at this point i could n't help but let out a small chuckle 
 & gt end user : this is n't funny get over here now 
 i could hear her frustrated scream slightly fade away as she went to put the phone on the receiver 
 <unk> boss man walks over to me 
 he heard the whole thing 
 & gt boss man : you know it 's almost 5. you do n't really <unk> to take this ... & gt me : <unk> ... i 'll take a look anyhow she sounds like she could use some help 
 & gt boss man : you 're a <unk> man than i manyinterests 
 i 'll be available if you need me 
 i gather as many details from the service call request as i can grab basically every possible part i could possibly need and head out 
 luckily the derp building is less than a 10 minute drive should be an impressive response time 
 i arrive at the derp building 
 given the circumstances i forgo the customary call on arrival get my visitor badge and head for end user 's office 
 i knock on the open door to signal my arrival 
 mistake 
 & gt end user : <unk> 
 *** are you trying to kill me 
 i 'm so dumbfounded i ca n't do anything but just look on in shock and awe 
 she is a hot mess her fancy business <unk> is all but ruined 
 her office looked lake a <unk> passed through 
 writing <unk> scattered about <unk> of which were broken in half papers scattered everywhere spilled <unk> ... after staring at one another for a moment i speak up 
 & gt me : hi end user 
 i 'm here t -- & gt end user : about time 
 she <unk> me to a laptop on her desk 
 & gt me : so i understand it wo n't power on is that correct 
 & gt end user : <unk> <unk> that 's the reason i called 
 the damn thing is dead and it wo n't turn on fix it 
 & gt me : sure thing ma'am but first i 'd like to ask you some <unk> -- & gt end user : go on ask 
 & gt me : when did you first encounter the problem 
 have you had issues with your battery holding charge 
 issues with the charging <unk> 
 or <unk> -- & gt end user : no 
 i do n't know 
 just fix it 
 & gt me : okay well i <unk> -- & gt end user : well i just do n't care 
 do you know who i am 
 do you know what will happen if you ca n't get this working 
 do you realize how important this is 
 i sat and listened to all the reasons why this needed to get done *now* for about 2 minutes straight 
 it does n't sound like a long time but it was 
 after she was done i said nothing and just took a look at the computer to try and see if the led diagnostics work 
 before i even tried ... it appeared as though end user tried jamming the charging cable into the jack <unk> ... and missed ... several times 
 there was obvious signs of damage to the plastic 
 hopefully it 's just <unk> 
 & gt me : would you happen to have the ac adapter here 
 & gt end user : the what 
 & gt me : the charging cable 
 she points to a drawer 
 i open it up to find the end connector has been damaged bent at a pretty decent angle 
 i close the drawer 
 & gt me : <unk> erm ... actually i brought one of my own along 
 i was surprised i did n't get an earful from end user for about 30 seconds while i fetched the ac adapter from box containing every part this computer has 
 little did i know i was just in the eye of the storm 
 plugged my ac adapter in the charging light <unk> once after i jiggle the adapter in the loose socket 
 i get it in a sweet spot and am able to maintain power and turn the laptop on 
 end user begins to turn that frown upside down 
 the lcd is damaged 
 the display is completely useless 
 as policy dictates because i discovered customer <unk> damage i had to inform end user that i would have to call the manufacturer company to check to see if her warranty covers accidental '' damage 
 i was really cutting her a break with jack damage but a damaged lcd could n't be ignored or i 'd get in trouble 
 & gt me : ma'am because i 've discovered some physical damage on your laptop i 'm going to have to call into support to confirm your warranty covers accidental damage 
 & gt end user : are you serious 
 it 's covered just fix it 
 & gt me : unfortunately ma'am i ca n't until i call that 's our <unk> -- & gt end user : i ca n't believe this 
 we 'll see what *boss <unk> has to say about that 
 while i call in to confirm her warranty end user goes and frantically <unk> the phone 
 i 'm not even sure if she knows what number she 's pressing 
 she definitely dialed more than 10 digits 
 when her call does not connect she lets out a <unk> scream and slams the phone down on the receiver as hard as she could breaking the <unk> pretty impressive actually end user was not by any means a <unk> woman 
 at this point end user just stares at the wall breathing heavily while i 'm on the phone with support 
 her warranty does *not* cover accidental damage 
 i inform her that her warranty does not cover accidental damage and i would be unable to perform the repair unless she or someone else was able to sign the work order authorizing the repair and <unk> the cost of the <unk> repair for a new motherboard and lcd assembly 
 evidently her scream from earlier had worried the few workers that were still left on the floor 
 security was summoned and arrived at end user 's office 
 it was the guy who gave me my visitor badge 
 & gt security man : <unk> <unk> is everything alright in here 
 i could not -- still can not -- believe what happened next 
 end user breaks down screaming and in tears 
 after about 15 seconds of <unk> screaming and sobbing end user <unk> out ... & gt end user : he ... *-sob-* ... he came in here and he <unk> <unk> *-sob-* i i i i *-sob-* was j- j- just trying to help him fix it and he <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> what 
 the 
 fuck 
 i am stunned 
 the security guy is also stunned 
 we exchange stunned <unk> 
 & gt end user : <unk> <unk> he slammed my <unk> *-sob-* into my <unk> 
 *-sob-* <unk> <unk> i could n't believe what was happening 
 the security guard radios for the police to be called 
 fuck 
 fuck 
 fuck 
 seriously what 
 the 
 fuck 
 the security guard <unk> me to sit at a cubicle adjacent to the office while he addresses end user 
 i call up boss man and tell him what 's going on 
 by the time i finish explaining to boss man what happened the police had arrived on scene 
 i ask boss man to call my fiance and tell her what 's happened 
 & gt police man : sir i need to ask you some questions 
 i 'm frantic & gt me : look i have no idea why she 's acting this way the place was a mess when i got there i swear i did n't lay a <unk> -- & gt police man : calm down 
 i 'm not worried about that 
 just tell me what happened 
 i recount my version of the events to the officer 
 there 's now 4 officers on scene 
 after about an hour of waiting in a cubicle alone boss man and my fiance show up 
 i 'm almost in tears when i see them 
 from the joy of seeing them not so much from the distress just thought i 'd clarify & gt & gt i give my fiance a hug trying to keep my composure 
 i thank boss man for coming and bringing my fiance 
 boss man can tell i 'm real shook up 
 he did a good job of <unk> my <unk> as we waited to hear back from the police 
 & gt boss man : not quite how you expected to be earning overtime is it 
 we laugh and talk for a while 
 another hour and a half later and police man comes back 
 he looks pissed 
 this worries me 
 & gt police man : <unk> manyinterests 
 & gt me : yes 
 & gt police man : i 'm going to need you to fill out this affidavit describing what happened here today 
 you 're not being charged and are free to go 
 ms. user is being charged with making a false report 
 relief finally came to me and my fiance we hug 
 i begin filling out the affidavit so i can finally get the hell out of there 
 & gt boss man : looks like you got your work cut out for you there 
 & gt me : should n't take too long to put this down into paper 
 & gt boss man : no i mean you 're still going to have to service that laptop you 've been assigned to the call and on site for like 4 hours now it 's a high priority call 
 i stare blankly for a second 
 & gt boss man : <unk> gotcha 
 just kidding - you can do it monday 
 i give him an <unk> face and then we say our <unk> 
 i finish the affidavit and go home wishing i still delivered pizza for a living 
 we ordered pizza for dinner since my fiance did n't have a chance to cook 
 gave the delivery guy a big tip and told him not to quit his job 
 edit : thank you so much for gold 
 my first post in tfts 
 i am truly <unk> i 'm a relative newbie in the land of tech support - started around 6 months ago 
 still that has n't stopped me from running into some real <unk> though i will say that 95 % of my users have been very very good 
 sometimes they do stupid stuff but most of the time they 're apologetic when they 've done something silly and are generally pleasant people to work with 
 except a few 
 so about 3 months ago $ user puts in a ticket 
 she uses a personal laptop for work to remote access into the system and she 's forgotten her password 
 this also happens to be the admin account 
 she is locked out of her laptop 
 now we 're usually an agreeable lot 
 if someone had come to us and said that they had locked themselves out of their personal laptop and they were n't sure how to fix it we 'd help them out 
 probably say it might take us a little while since it 'd be a <unk> time sort of job but we 'd get it sorted for them 
 unless the person in question happens to be a <unk> tool 
 let me set the scene - $ user comes up to my desk five minutes after writing the ticket carrying a laptop bag and immediately i 'm on red alert 
 i know for a fact this is n't a <unk> laptop and i also know this woman is notorious for being a pain to deal with every time 
 my boss sits on the other side of my desk facing me so is easily in eyesight and earshot of everything that 's happening 
 & gt $ user : hi i 've forgotten my password for the admin account on my laptop 
 do you have a record of it 
 immediately i wince 
 of course we do n't have records of the <unk> laptops but i have a feeling she is n't going to see it that way 
 & gt $ me : this is your personal laptop correct 
 & gt $ user : yes 
 but i use it for work 
 so it 's a work laptop 
 you should have the password 
 i wanted to point out how wrong that logic was but decided not to anger the fairly senior member of staff 
 instead i just nodded <unk> as though she was completely correct and offered to help 
 & gt $ me : well i 'm afraid we do n't 
 we might be able <unk> & gt $ user : well that 's ridiculous 
 it 's a work laptop you should be able to get into it for me 
 you set it up 
 & gt $ me : well no we set up the remote desktop application so you could do your work remotely we <unk> & gt $ user : you should have tracked the admin password 
 i know this stuff my husband works in it 
 at this point i 'm just sort of blankly staring at her wondering what i did to deserve this woman speaking to me as though i 'm something stuck on the bottom of her <unk> 
 being new i was already being <unk> into just doing as she said but thankfully my boss is n't so easily <unk> 
 & gt $ boss : excuse me just so i 'm hearing this correctly - you have a personal laptop that you have forgotten the password for and you 're saying this is our fault 
 and instead of asking politely for us to solve this problem for you you 're talking to my staff like dirt 
 he did not say dirt 
 at this point she gets a little <unk> and places the laptop on his desk 
 & gt $ user : well ... can you get me in 
 i really need it 
 my boss looks at the laptop 
 he looks at me 
 he looks at the $ user 
 he looks back to the laptop and carefully pushes it back towards her 
 & gt $ boss : your husband works in it right 
 i 'm sure he can sort this out for you 
 bye bye 
 to this day i do n't think her 'it husband has got into her laptop 
 edit : well this blew up while i was asleep 
 for all those talking about a fix we certainly could have got her in 
 we did n't want to 
 and yes my boss is awesome as are the rest of my coworkers 
 and thank you for my first <unk> tale comes from many <unk> ago when i worked it at a college 
 this was originally going to be a reply to a comment on another story but it wound up being huge so i 'll submit a new post instead 
 i was doing the rounds one day in the admin block only to find an elderly woman leaning right across her desk <unk> at a 17 '' crt 
 i thought she must have been an old hag at first and that was her punishment for upsetting someone in it but i still felt bad for her and asked if she would like me to at least make her font bigger so she could read it from her chair 
 she turned out to be one of the <unk> people that worked there and she never submitted any tickets for anything because she did n't want to be any trouble so i asked my manager if i could take 2 spare monitors over to her desk to assist her work besides leaning across like that all day ca n't be good for you 
 i found 2 24 '' lcd monitors biggest available at the time and took them over to her desk and showed her how to easily switch between monitors for multitasking and window management 
 i left the office feeling good for having made such a difference to someone 's job and making things much easier for her even though it was such a simple task then i got back to my pc to update the job on the system only to find a ticket submitted from the admin block 
 i knew the username well she always submitted priority one tickets for her audio not working hurry 
 you must go <unk> her audio 
 or her mouse stopped working better go plug it back in <unk> 
 turns out her 23 '' monitors were n't big enough not now someone in the office had 24 '' monitors 
 of course priority 1. i had the pleasure of informing her that we had none left in our asset stock and our next asset order was n't for another 3 months so she would have to wait for the order to come through 
 a week later i was doing the rounds again and i saw she had switched monitors with the elderly woman 
 not on my watch 
 i went back to my office to fetch my tools and the <unk> monitor bracket that was taking up my limited space in the storage room glad to get rid of it 
 i made my way back and began <unk> and screwing making sure this bracket was fully secured then began the monitor transfer removing the stand so they were completely useless without the whole bracket 
 as the last cable was being plugged in the monitor thief returned and demanded to know what i was doing 
 & amp gt me : i 'm returning these monitors to the machine they 're assigned to 
 & amp gt her : you ca n't do that 
 she does n't even need monitors that big anyway 
 & amp gt me : actually i have to the asset tags are assigned to that machine so they must stay where they are for security purposes 
 & amp gt her : what a load of bullshit 
 do n't try pulling that on me i 'll be seeing you manager as soon as i 'm done here 
 you just wait 
 & amp gt ceo : what 's all the yelling out here 
 & amp gt her : he took my monitors 
 & amp gt ceo : what are those on your desk 
 & amp gt her : ... & amp gt me : as i was just explaining the monitors i 've just mounted on this bracket are assigned to this machine so she 's not to take them again which is why they 're now a permanent feature of this desk 
 & amp gt ceo : ... did n't we have this conversation a few months ago 
 i told you before to stop helping yourself to all the office equipment because it makes for unnecessary hunting down of asset tags and updating of locations when we have our monthly audits 
 & amp gt her : ... yes sir 
 i then took the opportunity to remind her the ticket system is not to be abused and if she submits a priority 1 for something like plugging in a mouse again i 'll be setting up a script that automatically sets her to priority 5. ceo had a good chuckle and wandered off shaking his head while i left out the opposite door feeling a burning in my back as she stared daggers at me 
 edit : wow this was more popular than i thought it would be 
 i 'll have to dig into the deep <unk> of my mind and bring you guys another story of the same <unk> 
 short but i 'm sure many of you have had the same or a similar experience 
 very brief background 
 i work for a company who does it support for businesses and schools both on site and remote work 
 this <unk> from a user logging tickets on our fault logging system that started off reasonably pleasant but quickly became pretty ridiculous 
 it then led to this phonecall to my boss 
 & gt user : since <unk> attended site and installed the new projector my internet at home has not been working 
 i want someone to come to my house and resolve this issue free of charge 
 & gt my boss : obviously this is not related as the two are in no way linked at <unk> **user <unk> & gt user : of course they are all linked they are all computers 
 how can you be serious 
 you need to resolve this issue 
 & gt my boss : unfortunately that is not our issue and we have are not obligated to provide free home support 
 i can maybe help you through some possible fixes 
 & gt user : but you 're <unk> 
 all it is supported by our contract 
 it was at this point my boss proceeded to sit them down and discuss what is and is n't in their contract 
 safe to say that user has n't called again 
 9 years ago i was neck deep in a project when i get a frantic call from a customer representative 
 our normal mortgage rep was on vacation so they threw $ cuterep in the deep end of mortgage lending despite no training 
 & gt cuterep : <unk> i was doing the paperwork for a home <unk> loan and i do n't know what i did but all the documents are gone and they 're going to fire me and i 'll have to go work at <unk> 's or start <unk> and ... & gt me : well do n't go buy <unk> yet 
 let me take a look 
 i go over but i 'll be damned if she did n't manage to delete all of the mortgage lending <unk> 
 & gt me : give me an hour and i 'll see what i can do 
 i had to drive 30 minutes to where we stored our offsite backup tapes 
 i get back throw the tape in and about 10 minutes later have everything recovered 
 & gt me : ok double check but everything should be back out there now 
 wait ... why are you still crying 
 & gt $ cuterep : it 's just been a really stressful week and i just knew i 'd messed up really bad 
 thank you so much <unk> for everything 
 <unk> would you like to come to my birthday party this weekend 
 9 years later we 're married and have a 6 year old girl 
 so always remember to have good backups and do n't judge a user from your first impression 
 they may just go and turn out to be a smart funny <unk> person 
 edit : whoa this blew up 
 after we started dating a few weeks later she pretty much just moved into my apartment 
 we dated and worked together for about 2 years and on <unk> night 2008 she took a <unk> test before going out with her friends for her birthday 
 we have a nepotism policy at work that management ended up <unk> for situations like this 
 we decided she would resign after her maternity leave was up side note - i still appreciate work for letting her stay on and pay her maternity leave when they did n't have to 
 18 months after our daughter was born $ cuterep and i <unk> in vegas 
 a year and a half later we bought a house and we 're still in love and happy together 
 my very first job was as the help desk for a company of 400+ employees 
 my office '' was literally a converted closet in the back corner of the building and my entire purpose was to sit there and wait for someone to call me so i could assist them with a technical issue 
 when i first started i was paranoid of doing anything wrong which could get me fired so i did n't even use the computer to browse the internet 
 i just sat there each day staring at a phone waiting for someone to call for technical help 
 unbeknownst to me the company occasionally had a surprise half-day '' 
 on a random friday the ceo would email the company informing everyone they could leave at noon and start their weekend early 
 unfortunately since i was new i had not been added to the <unk> '' mailing list and was not informed of this occasion 
 and no one thought to check on the help desk kid sitting in the back closet to make sure he knew to leave early 
 so my first surprise half-day '' was spent sitting in a closet alone staring at a desk phone diligently waiting for a call from someone ... anyone ... when the entire company had left 4 hours earlier 
 i only realized something was <unk> when i walked to my car at the end of the day and the entire parking lot was empty to add salt to my wounds my dad also worked at the company at the time 
 when i arrived home my dad just asked what took you so long 
 thanks dad 
 tldr started job as help desk sat alone in a closet staring at a phone was not informed that the entire company left early my career in it is relatively young 
 prior to this i made lattes and dealt with day to day abuse from cranky <unk> 
 nothing has really changed honestly 
 i got a call from my boss the other day 
 & gt '' hey <unk> one of our new clients is opening an office and they 're going with imacs 
 you 're familiar with macs right '' 
 ah shit 
 i know exactly where this is going 
 & gt '' yeah 
 why what 's up '' 
 & gt '' well you 're kinda the only one at the office who knows them 
 i have n't touched a mac since the first <unk> imacs so i 'm gon na send you out to set things up '' 
 ahh yes 
 the ol putting os x on the resume coming to bite me in the ass '' 
 mind you i do know os <unk> better than i know windows at this point to be fair 
 because that 's what i use at home and have since 2003. so seeing as it 's part of my skill set i head 40 miles out to do their setup 
 upon arrival i 'm greeted by the owner of this particular company 
 & gt '' so we bought 20 new imacs since they 're the best computer out there 
 shit 
 & gt '' and i just need to know this is going to run all of the software we use at our other offices 
 shit 
 & gt '' it 's kinda mission critical these all play nice with our windows machines and do what they do 
 shit 
 & gt '' in fact is it possible to just install windows 7 on all of them '' 
 i 'm flabbergasted 
 this guy 
 this fucking guy 
 he bought 20 27 '' imacs 
 he spent $ 3,000 <unk> <unk> for a tb of flash storage and <unk> of memory 
 and he wants me to basically completely remove any reason for having purchased macs 
 so i stood there for a second and thought you know what 
 i 'm not gon na argue with him 
 i 'm just going to sit here with my head buried in my hands and rub my eyes and think about my life choices 
 i 'm going to stop at starbucks on the way home and ask for my old job back and just forget about all of this tomfoolery '' 
 & gt '' yeah actually we can do that but you 're going to have to buy windows licenses for them 
 that 's gon na run you around $ <unk> 
 plus the time it 's going to take to do the installs and what have you you will probably go over budget '' 
 & gt '' i do n't care these are the best computers money can buy and i want windows '' 
 & gt '' alright 
 i 'll have to make a couple calls really quick '' 
 and i did 
 and we got it all sorted out 
 and the better part of two days was spent loading the machines with windows and the boot camp software 
 aside from the resolution <unk> out at 4k they were coming out great 
 and then another request from the owner 
 & gt '' hey can you make these <unk> like macs 
 they do n't look like macs 
 they look like windows 
 i do n't want our clients to think we 're using windows '' 
 this office is n't a client facing office 
 no one but the employees come in here 
 there is n't a single client that is going to see these machines 
 ever 
 for any reason 
 so i 'm going to try my best to convince him this is a bad idea because i am a rookie and that 's what we do best 
 try to reason with people 
 people that buy $ 3,000 machines to run office and a handful of other applications 
 also i do n't feel like dealing with the inevitable calls and complaints from <unk> these things but that 's neither here nor there & gt '' well any unnecessary skins or <unk> might affect the <unk> and performance of the machines 
 it 'd be best to leave it as it is '' 
 & gt '' these are the best computers money can buy they 're not going to be affected at all '' 
 stop 
 using 
 that 
 phrase 
 & gt '' it 's not about the machines it 's about the software 
 your programs wo n't run <unk> with those skins installed '' 
 ah yes 
 tell him the things wo n't run 
 then he has no option 
 & gt '' well ca n't you program one that will work 
 you 're an it guy you have to know how to program this stuff '' 
 i do n't 
 i have no fucking clue how to do what he 's asking of me and i do n't want to touch it with a ten foot pole 
 & gt '' i 'm sorry but that 's a bit outside my skill set 
 you 'd have to contact a programmer to do it specifically for what you need '' 
 & gt '' do n't you have one at your company '' 
 & gt '' no unfortunately we do n't have any programmers on staff that do this sort of thing '' 
 & gt '' well then ask them 
 someone has to know how '' 
 so i step into the other room and call one of our programmers 
 & gt '' hey $ chiefprogrammer the windows imac guy wants a mac skin on these things '' 
 & gt '' that guy is insane 
 his last lab was a nightmare 
 he kept going on about buying the <unk> machines money can buy and would n't shut up about how much money he spent on the workstations '' 
 & gt '' so what do i do now '' 
 & gt '' put him on the phone '' 
 there is a couple minutes of back and forth between the owner and the programmer 
 he hands the phone back to me 
 & gt '' your programmer said it would cost a half million to write that program and take at least a year to deliver '' 
 what 
 that 's not ... actually that was not a bad move 
 & gt '' yeah it <unk> some serious compatibility issues 
 i mean it could ruin these machines if it 's not done properly '' 
 & gt '' well i 'm not paying that much or waiting that long 
 no one sees these machines other than the employees anyway 
 that 's absolutely fucking ridiculous 
 if apple can make them look like macs i do n't see why you ca n't too '' 
 and that was that 
 he went back to his office i finished up with cable management and the other <unk> and headed back to our office where i promptly went into $ chiefprogrammer 's office 
 & gt '' you told him $ <unk> and a year for that '' 
 & gt '' the only language this guy talks is money 
 you have to reason with people in that sense sometimes 
 just throw outrageous figures and they accept the limitations 
 this guy just needed a *really* outrageous figure '' 
 tl dr : programmer speaks many languages even user 
 **edit : for all of you suggesting a vm do n't worry it was suggested 
 but that 's not real windows 
 it wo n't work with our software '' <unk> any other suggestion i had 
 ** in my last story we met the owner of a particular restaurant where i used to work 
 a particular individual who had a particular <unk> to spending a single penny on anything that she did n't deem absolutely necessary -- and her definition of necessary '' was very very <unk> 
 in that story the cat was let out of the bag that i was good with computers '' so henceforth i became the computer guy and i got tasked with looking at anything vaguely electronic in the restaurant 
 this was n't as bad as it sounded despite our <unk> <unk> and <unk> software running on aging and failing 
 hardware 
 which as previously explained would no longer be serviced by the original vendor after the owner called them up and cussed them out over the terms of the service contract claiming they were ripping her off '' 
 this also meant that other folks who worked at the restaurant brought me stuff to fix 
 this was during the <unk> maybe two years or so after the iphone had been released and during the start of the smartphone boom 
 so i got brought a lot of phones laptops <unk> and sometimes even desktop machines to fix 
 i worked up a <unk> rate for my services so everyone got the same fair deal and i got paid 
 the kitchen staff in particular were always especially <unk> and had were happy to pay me for my trouble 
 but then 
 one day there was a third computer on our counter 
 our usual two <unk> machines of course including the one which was still running with an espresso <unk> full of <unk> weighing down its <unk> heat sink 
 that computer and the owner 's refusal to replace or repair it properly is where we left of last time 
 but next to it was a swanky all-in-one touchscreen terminal running a demo of a new pos package 
 be still my heart 
 an actual <unk> investment 
 i almost could n't believe it 
 but then the inevitable happened 
 & gt '' two thousand dollars '' 
 the owner shrieked to no one in particular as she stormed through the dining room one day 
 she had a freshly torn open envelope in her hand which she <unk> into the cashiers <unk> on her way past 
 i surreptitiously took it and found it was an installation estimate from the vendor who supplied the new pos terminal 
 it had a new printer with it as well presumably which would replace our stone age kitchen ticket printers 
 i noticed it was networked and plugged into our hub with an ethernet cable rather than a <unk> cable 
 & gt '' two thousand dollars for a few wires '' 
 she continued to rant 
 we can do it ourselves '' 
 she poked me in the chest as she said this 
 & gt '' i 'm going to go out on a limb and assume that by <unk> you mean <unk> '' i said 
 & gt '' of course 
 you 're the computer guy right '' 
 & gt '' $ 40 an hour '' i said nonchalantly as possible 
 & gt '' what '' 
 she bellowed 
 beyond ridiculous 
 i already pay you '' 
 & gt '' barely '' i said 
 i work for tips 
 you pay me $ 3 an hour 
 if i 'm climbing around in the <unk> stringing cables all over the place that 's way outside my job description 
 and i 'm not making any tips while i 'm doing it 
 you want skilled work you pay skilled rates 
 just like the kitchen staff does 
 if you want me to do it when i 'm on my shift i 'm staying clocked in too 
 if you do n't want to pay me twice i 'll do it on my next day off '' 
 & gt '' fine 
 whatever 
 do it tomorrow '' 
 & gt '' after we close or what '' 
 i asked 
 & gt she was turning increasingly crimson 
 no right when we open '' 
 i should point out that the entire kitchen which is where all the cables and printers had to go had a drop ceiling from the <unk> 's over it 
 all the existing cables went through the ceiling since the floor was a concrete slab 
 anything i touched up there would trigger a <unk> <unk> 
 & gt '' bad plan '' i tried to explain 
 you 're going to get dust and god knows what else all over an operating kitchen '' 
 & gt '' i do n't care 
 i 'm not coming in early just for wires '' 
 she stormed off 
 well the business license ai n't in my name lady 
 see if i care if a health inspector shows up when i 'm elbow deep in 40 year old drop tiles right over your <unk> 
 i bought a big ol <unk> of cat5 and got chewed out for the expense and a box of <unk> cable ends why ca n't we reuse the ones from our old cables '' 
 and right at opening the next morning i got to work 
 all told it took me three hours to make six cable drops because i had to keep working around the cooks 
 if i were n't doing it in a running kitchen i could have finished in half the time 
 but at the end of the day i <unk> $ 120 and kept the rest of the cat5 
 i forgot to tell you the <unk> behind getting the new system in the first place though 
 at least as the owner explained to me she was convinced money was disappearing from the <unk> and employees were stealing it 
 our old pos system was set up to require manager <unk> out the <unk> for pretty much everything including changing already printed orders for any reason and opening the till without the key ... which was frequently missing 
 the owner had the only override code and she was rarely there so her code was an open secret 
 presumably since she canceled the service contract with the vendor of the old system she was unable to -- or unable to get help with -- changing anyone else 's user permissions 
 the new system was going to solve *all* of our problems 
 it will stop money from getting <unk> from the till it will solve our ingredient waste it 'll scrub the bathroom floor whatever 
 i told her in no uncertain terms this was nuts 
 but i imagine she 'd painted herself into a corner by pissing off the old system 's vendor 
 for what it 's worth the guys from the new pos company spent a lot of time <unk> the system to meet our -- or rather *her* <unk> -- needs 
 this included setting up our menu in the system all the accounting stuff automatic mapping of our delivery area the whole nine <unk> 
 this system also supported <unk> for the time rfid keys which could be used in lieu of passwords 
 i imagine this made the owner 's little ears perk up most of all since it meant she could just keep her key with her and micromanage to her heart 's content without anyone being able to shoulder surf her password 
 the demo terminal was kept on the counter for a few weeks and we were able to play with it make practice orders and also provide feedback to the vendor to help with the setup 
 so far so good 
 i asked the owner when the new system was going to be installed figuring i 'd have to be on hand to help 
 she refused to tell me 
 i found out why on a sunday morning about a month later 
 i arrived at the restaurant a little before opening because the owner had gone on vacation back to greece for two weeks 
 her notoriously unreliable maintenance guy and <unk> was predictably still in bed hung over guess who was actually doing the stealing by the way and thus no one else could open 
 still a little foggy from working until close the night before i was pleasantly surprised initially to find that all of our old computers and printers were gone and replaced with swanky new touchscreen terminals and the new network printers 
 i guess they must have come in after closing last night with the owner and set everything up 
 how kind of her to tell me 
 that surprise became much less pleasant when i booted up one of the machines to discover that it was blank 
 as in it had the software installed but it had n't been configured 
 all of that work we did with the vendor on the demo terminal 
 not apparent 
 our menu blank 
 our map blank 
 our user list empty 
 except for one user with the owner 's initials 
 grand 
 i said a very naughty word and went to the supply closet to see if our old computers were there 
 of course they were gone 
 i phoned the owner 
 no response 
 i left her a voicemail <unk> a few choice words 
 i was just about ready to drive downtown or wherever it was to the vendor 's office and <unk> somebody but i had a restaurant to open 
 my cashiers were starting to show up now and we had a really big problem 
 so having to take orders by hand on paper is not technically the end of the universe 
 occasionally we had to do it during for instance power outages and so forth of course the owner had us working and cooking by flashlight rather than closing temporarily 
 but a bigger problem was that *everything* went through the system 
 this was true with our old system as well 
 it was our punch clock for tracking employees hours and i was n't going to trust that to paper because the owner was already notorious for wage theft and looking for any excuse to cheat people out of pay 
 our inventory of ingredients and purchases from vendors was tracked through it our deliveries tracked and assigned to specific drivers etc 
 even our credit cards were processed through the system 
 in other words we were hosed 
 and since we did n't open until well into <unk> on <unk> i already had customers <unk> up at the door 
 suddenly a lot of <unk> were on me 
 & gt '' what are we supposed to do '' 
 our head <unk> asked me 
 & gt '' take orders on paper '' i said 
 cash only 
 use the old carbon copy <unk> we have under the <unk> 
 just use the damn computers as <unk> for now 
 anybody needs to clock in or out see me 
 i 'll see what i can do about this '' 
 what would i do about this 
 i tried the owner 's phone again and got nothing 
 perhaps stupidly i did not have any contact info for the new system 's vendor because the owner was being so secretive with me 
 i started wishing i kept that estimate she threw away 
 all the times she met with the vendor it was behind closed doors with ... our maintenance guy 
 needless to say he was not answering his phone 
 i <unk> out our second most reliable driver 
 & gt '' you 
 go to bob 's house and wake his punk ass up '' 
 i 'm calling him bob on account of how that 's his name 
 & gt in his best <unk> <unk> impersonation my driver said find him and bring him to me ... '' so the rfid keyfobs the new system used could also be <unk> with a password 
 on a <unk> i tried the owner 's old password which unsurprisingly did n't work 
 on the third attempt i got in though 
 <unk> daughter 's birthday ... backwards 
 the passwords were <unk> only and since the touch screen terminals did n't have keyboards this was obvious enough because when you were prompted for a password it only gave you a number pad 
 it was at least an hour before my driver managed to drag bob <unk> and hung over back to the restaurant 
 in the meantime business worked like this : i using the owner 's admin account holding a paper copy of our menu in one hand added things to the system 's menu in the order they were needed as customers ordered them 
 then one of the cashiers on the other terminal would enter the order and it 'd print in the kitchen 
 in the <unk> seconds between orders i managed to set up pretty much everybody with an employee login and get them clocked in 
 and using the owner 's manager override ability edit their time card to the correct time 
 i figured as soon as i had a chance to breathe after lunch rush i 'd go through and add in anything we missed on the menu and figure out how to get the credit card processing working 
 so eventually bob was brought before me looking very miserable 
 i did n't even have to ask him the question 
 & gt '' so the owner flipped out about paying the new computer guys for the service contract '' he said openly lighting a cigarette right there behind the counter 
 but she did n't want to give back the new computers 
 so they said they 'll take back all the set up stuff they did and she said she did n't need them anyway so they left '' 
 & gt '' and i was supposed to learn this when '' 
 i asked 
 he just shrugged and <unk> off to the back room 
 i was later able to confirm the story from the vendor after i got their contact info from bob 
 the support guy i talked to there was apologetic and very reasonable about the whole thing and once he figured out he was dealing with me and not the owner he even went a bit above the call of duty and helped me with getting our credit card processing set up 
 but i can understand the vendor 's <unk> ... no pay no service 
 no ticket no shirt 
 by the end of the day i was able to get the system fully set up get everyone put in the payroll system and <unk> in and out and get the ingredient inventory tracking working 
 i did n't get a phone call from the owner until the next day 
 obviously i had to give her a brief rundown of what i was able to accomplish 
 as soon as it dawned on her that i 'd done many things like setting up new users which she was promised could only be done by an administrator her she went ballistic 
 never mind all the other problems that this <unk> plan of hers caused her only concern was having complete and total control of the system while everyone else had none 
 & gt '' you <unk> my system '' 
 she shrieked at me through the phone 
 & gt '' no '' i said i saved your business '' 
 i hung up on <unk> i am an i.t specialist at a small company and we often get samples of furniture that is to be shown to the directors via a piece of software that was created in house before i started working there 
 the program simply allows for someone me to add an image of the sample and then the program will send an email to the director and tell them to view the image on the program 
 it 's tedious but only has to be done every so often 
 so we just got some new samples into the office and before i got chance to take a picture and upload it to the program the office manager send a picture of them to one of the directors via text 
 he did n't tell me about doing this he simply did it 
 when i <unk> the images to the program and the director got an email i was asked to bring the samples to his house 
 i started to move the samples at which point the office manager realised what has happened and proceeded to explode at me telling me this program i made was useless and <unk> his work even though i did n't make it 
 he told me to take the samples to the director and never come back because i was fired 
 i told the director this when i got to his house and i also told him how the office manager had spent 3 hours out of the office to buy a football shirt 
 the director looked furious told me to go back to the office and he would follow he went in before me and is now currently down the hall screaming at the office manager while i type this up 
 feels good 
 tl dr : office manager fires me over program i did n't make he gets a <unk> <unk> from director for trying to fire me and also for being out of the office for 3 hours to buy a football shirt 
 **update 1** first of all i 'm so shocked at how much this has blown up 
 may not be considered blown up for some but this now has more up votes than all of my other posts combined 
 a lot of you have been saying to start logging <unk> dirt on the manager and i 've been logging what 's been going on since 
 i 've also just managed to get access to his emails so i can start to mess with him to take his mind of me if i need to 
 so far what he has done is just ask me stupid things like 'why is my laptop not turning on 
 when it 's out of battery and not plugged in 
 i tell him this and he <unk> like it was n't the correct answer 
 more to come soon 
 **update 2** yes i am british 
 **update 3** so i took your guys advice and <unk> the whole going through his emails thing 
 he also seems to be being friendly with me 
 i was stuck in <unk> yesterday and could n't get back to work in manchester and he 's been cracking jokes about it 
 **user** : i 'm locked out **me** : ok what 's your name 
 **user** : jane b 
 <unk> multiple jane b 's on the system* **me** : what 's the b stand for 
 **user** : ... i do n't know what you mean 
 it finally happened 
 i literally asked a user their name and they said i do n't know '' 
 this is a tale about bravery 
 bravery in the face of <unk> 
 bravery of those small few <unk> that serve their <unk> masters so that they can feed themselves their <unk> and their children 
 those men and women who listened understood and resolved an issue of monstrous <unk>

 after 45 minutes of music 
 **tech 1** : & lt speech & gt **me** : & lt account info & gt **tech 1** : how can i help you 
 **me** : i have been having a very high ping to the internet after about 4pm till about 9pm everyday since i got your service installed 
 i have tried restarting the modem the router and my computer 
 **tech 1** : please restart your computer 
 **me** : ok. but i have already done that 
 i actually had restarted my computer but i did it again anyways 
 **tech 1** : i understand but we need to make sure that this does n't fix it 
 **me** : well i get these high pings from all five of my computers not just the one i am working on right now 
 **tech 1** : um how do you have five computers using the internet 
 **me** : with my router 
 **tech 1** : uh ... a what 
 **me** : a router 
 **tech 1** : sir we do n't support non-standard equipment 
 **me** : excuse me 
 10 more minutes goes by as i disconnect my router directly connect my computer to the router and power cycle the modem twice such that my pc 's mac address would get registered with their system relevant 
 the high ping remains and i eventually get the tech to say the magic words : **tech 1** : it looks like we are going to have to send out somebody 
 **me** : thank you 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- next monday the tech arrives and we go down to the drop 
 i had not been present for the installation 
 the drop was in a locked basement inside of a locked cabinet both of which will be relevant later 
 the <unk> was truly <unk> 
 the single <unk> line that came in from the street was split 48 times 
 none of the lines were labeled 
 there were 9 splitters involved 
 we spent the first 15 minutes yelling at <unk> 4th floor window to exterior basement door to figure out which line was mine through the process of disconnecting one connection at a time 
 mine ended up being the forth split down 
 <unk> & gt <unk> & gt <unk> & gt 3way- & gt 3way- & gt me which i had split again with a <unk> 
 one for cable one for internet 
 **me** : well what can we do about it 
 **onsite tech 1** : i dont know 
 **me** : it works in the morning and late at night 
 **onsite tech 1** : it is probably because when people get home in the evening they turn on their <unk> and you are getting interference 
 **me** : so what can we do about it 
 the onsite tech closes and locks the cabinet 
 **onsite tech 1** : nothing 
 it is a wiring issue on the premises 
 we are not responsible

 week 3 thursday 
 still have a ping of <unk> 
 after 30 minutes of elevator music 
 <unk> 
 **tech 2** : & lt intro & gt what can i help you with 
 **me** : i have had a very high ping to the outside world between the hours of 4pm till 9pm rendering my internet unusable 
 i am interested in obtaining a partial refund for the time 
 **tech 2** : i am sorry to hear that sir 
 would you please reboot your computer 
 **me** : this is not an issue with my computer 
 comcast does not have a large enough drop for the apartment building i am in 
 **tech 2** : i am sorry to hear that sir 
 we need to go through these basic troubleshooting steps to see if we can <unk> the issue 
 for the next twenty minutes i play repair man 
 eventually the tech once again says the magic words 
 **me** : can i schedule the tech to come between 4pm and 9pm 
 **tech 2** : very well sir 
 you will have to wait until next thursday if that is the time slot you want 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- week 4 thursday 
 onsite tech 2 arrives around 4:30pm 
 perfect 
 after explaining the issue and what the last tech had said he checked the signal in my apartment 
 **onsite tech 2** : lets go look at the box downstairs 
 after unlocking the basement and the cabinet he lets out a low whistle 
 **onsite tech 2** : which one is yours 
 **me** : this one 
 i point at the line that goes to my apartment 
 **onsite tech 2** : alright so here is the issue 
 you have way too many splitters between your line and the drop coming in 
 i am going to replace the ends on your line to ensure we can get the best possible connection and then i am going to check the pole 
 we can run a new drop but that could take up to six months 
 at this point the tech looks at me 
 **onsite tech 2** : i am not allowed to <unk> these splitters because they are the owners property and other customers utilize these lines 
 and now i realize he is staring deep into my soul 
 **onsite tech 2** : the customers with these things do not have internet and only <unk> to basic tv 
 here he <unk> to several of the lines 
 he lets his hand come to rest on a filtered line 
 i blink 
 it is connected directly to the first splitter 
 **onsite tech 2** : they require much less signal 
 it is going to take me 5 minutes with my <unk> <unk> and <unk> to replace this tip 
 then i will be on the pole for twenty minutes 
 then i will come back to your apartment to check your signal again 
 i am sorry but i am **not** fixing this for you 
 i simply <unk> 
 i blink again 
 twice actually 
 the tech turns his back on me and starts removing my line from the splitter to replace the tip 
 i back out the basement door and bolt upstairs 
 i pull out my <unk> set and grab my <unk> 
 i run back downstairs just as the tech leaves the basement 
 he does n't close the door 
 i wait until he walks out the front gate 
 inside the basement i find the cabinet is closed but unlocked 
 quick quick quick i am taking my line and switching it with the filtered line on the first splitter 
 after everything is tight i close the cabinet and run back upstairs 
 the tech true to his word showed up at my door twenty five minutes after this all started 
 i had already reset my modem and had a <unk> ping to google 
 success 
 after testing my line ran with acceptable numbers 
 **onsite tech 2** : i am glad that replacing the tip on your line improved the signal to such an extent 
 i am going to go lock up the cabinet now 
 and he was gone into the night 
 i really honestly truly wish that this was the last i would have to see him 
 but it was n't 
 no 
 it can never be simple with comcast 
 my connection had improved considerably 
 a vast majority of the time i was receiving my advertised speed 
 i could <unk> to my <unk> content 
 the only problem i had was when i would attempt to connect to a server in southern california 
 you see anytime between roughly 4pm and 9pm i would have a ping of <unk> to any server south of san jose 
 this would n't normally be a problem for average web browsing but i also happen to be a <unk> 
 and for online gamers latency can be the difference between life and death 
 how did i know that the problem was in san jose 
 traceroutes 
 tons of them 
 automatically generated every minute every hour every day 
 the issue appeared to be that the peering between comcast and level 3 in san jose consisted of two 56k modems and smoke signals 
 <unk> of average latency times over the course of the day showed two <unk> 
 a small one in the morning as people woke up for coffee and internet and a longer one in the evening when people got off of work and decided it was time for a good <unk> 
 i decided to do <unk> with some friends from around the bay area 
 apparently comcast routed everything from the entire bay area through that <unk> peering arrangement in san jose 
 this was confirmed by onsite tech 2 the third time i met him

 **tech 3** : & lt intro & gt how can i help you 
 **me** : i have an issue where when i connect to some servers south of san jose i get high pings and it is difficult to enjoy my games at those pings 
 it is only during high traffic times and i have the traceroutes that describe the issue 
 **tech 3** : will you please restart your computer 
 **me** : look i know what the issue is 
 it is not with my computer i can demonstrate that it is a problem with comcast 's network 
 **tech 3** : i am sorry sir but we must go through these steps to ensure that it is not your equipment 
 often times restarting your computer will fix many problems 
 **me** : i know 
 i have restarted my computer many times 
 trust me 
 i have traceroutes that identify the issue 
 **tech 3** : you have what 
 **me** : traceroutes 
 **tech 3** : uhh ... i am going to elevate you to tier 2

 **tech 4** : & lt intro & gt how can i help you 
 **me** : & lt explains the situation & gt **tech 4** : can you please restart your computer 
 **me** : no 
 look 
 i have traceroutes that identify the issue 
 & lt explains about san jose & gt **tech 4** : sir after reviewing the network status board it does not appear that there are any issues on our network 
 this is most likely an issue on your end 
 **me** : look can i send you the traceroutes 
 **tech 4** : the what 
 **me** : & lt growling & gt traceroutes 
 they show the path that your connection travels between your computer and the server you are attempting to reach 
 **tech 4** : ... i am going to transfer you to another tech 
 please hold 
 30 seconds of music 
 **tech 5** : & lt intro & gt how can i help you 
 **me** : i have traceroutes that identify a connection between the comcast network and level 3 in san jose as the source of an exceptionally high ping that makes it difficult to play games online 
 **tech 5** : interesting ... i am going to send a tech out to your location to see if it is in relation to your earlier support tickets 
 **me** : ... i can plainly see that i get a sub <unk> ping to everywhere else in your network before the san jose hop 
 **tech 5** : how about monday at 10am 
 **me** : ... really 
 **tech 5** : yes 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- week 8 monday 10am 
 onsite tech 2 shows up and smiles at me 
 i try to tell him everything that is going on 
 **onsite tech 2** : let 's go down and look at your line again 
 i am worried he is going to say something about the fact that i moved my line 
 he opens up the cabinet and <unk> 
 **onsite tech 2** : i <unk> which one was your line 
 which one is it 
 i identify my moved line 
 he comments on the fact that it seems to be in an <unk> position and should n't be the issue 
 at this point he says he is going to go up on the pole and do some monitoring 
 for the next two hours his van sits outside the apartment complex 
 he comes back and informs me that he will be unable to fix the issue at this time because he can not identify anything other than the fact that the lines in this area are old and need to be replaced 
 he said that might happen within the next two to ten years 
 as he leaves **onsite tech 2** : keep calling 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- for the next two weeks i call every other day and get the run around 
 they are refusing to offer to send a tech out because the last report identified no issues 
 i am not willing to pay the <unk> dollars to have a tech come out if i request it 
 every time they insist that the network is operating normally and does not have any issues 
 finally in the middle of week 11 i get escalated and after what feels like the hundredth time they tell me everything is fine 
 **me** : the fuck it is 
 i can prove it is n't 
 **tech # 20 <unk> : i am going to transfer you 
 **me** : to who 
 nobody you transfer me to listens to what i have to say or understands what i am telling ... & lt immediately music cuts me off & gt 15 minutes of music later tech 5 answers the phone 
 **tech 5** : & lt intro & gt how can i help you 
 **me** : & lt i attempt to explain everything again & gt **tech 5** : we are going to send out the field tech again 
 **me** : again 
 this is n't going to fix it 
 **tech 5** : i know 
 **me** : what 
 **tech 5** : after he is done call this number # # # - # # # # 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- week 12 monday 4pm 
 onsite tech # 2 shows up 
 we talk 
 he goes up on the pole 
 he sits in his van 
 he <unk> around the neighborhood and checks various other drops 
 eventually he comes back to my door 
 **onsite tech 2** : were <unk> 
 **me** : how much 
 **onsite tech 2** : all of it 
 **me** : what 
 **onsite tech 2** : bay area 
 all of it 
 six months until the money people will even talk about buying more bandwidth 
 **me** : six months 
 **onsite tech 2** : yup 
 **me** : why when it <unk> everyone 
 **onsite tech 2** : most people never notice 
 most people do n't care 
 **me** : what can i do about it 
 **onsite tech 2** : keep calling 
 **me** : why 
 **onsite tech 2** : they only spend money to fix things if there are enough calls logged about an issue 
 the number tech 5 gave to me turned out to be the number to his line 
 for the next two months i would call him every week and onsite tech 2 would come out and sit in his van for two to three hours 
 then one day the call went a little <unk> 
 **tech 5** : & lt intro & gt 
 how may i help you 
 **me** : i am still having the same problem with the high latency out of san jose 
 **tech 5** : i am **not** going to help you with this 
 **me** : excuse me 
 **tech 5** : the network is <unk> as it is *intended* 
 **me** : uh ... **tech 5** : we do not officially support 3rd party devices like your router 
 & lt he has never brought this up before & gt **me** : um ... why not 
 & lt getting suspicious & gt **tech 5** : 3rd party devices like yours are able to change their mac addresses and we need to know that your mac address will not change to verify that you are the correct customer 
 & lt this is obviously bullshit ... but why & gt **me** : i do n't understand but ok ... what should i do about this issue with .. & lt he cuts me off & gt **tech 5** : i am **not** going to do anything to address this 
 the network is working as *intended* 
 & lt someone must be listening into the <unk> & gt **me** : ok. **tech 5** : please call the help line at <unk> # # # - # # # # if your issues persist 
 & lt and the line goes dead 
 not like he hung up just <unk> & gt 10 to 15 seconds later there is a dial-tone 
 i check my <unk> logs 
 just about 30 minutes before my call i see that my connection is no longer being routed through san jose 
 i have <unk> pings to every server i can try 
 tl dr isp 's are corporations driven by <unk> but there are always technicians at these <unk> who know what they are doing 
 they know the situation is fucked up 
 they know the ridiculousness of the problem 
 sometimes a problem is a problem because of the poor ethics of the people in the suits 
 sometimes good techs have to work at <unk> corporations to feed their families & lt i intentionally left this out for anonymity purposes & gt 
 edit : formatting 
 sorry first post to reddit 
 edit 2 : thank you to everyone 
 a big thank you to the people who gave me reddit <unk> one happened about a month into my first it gig for a major company was freelance before 
 i 'm visiting the hq from my branch office to meet the rest of the team for the first time and get the full training on the co 's systems 
 on my last night before my flight back home i get one of those <unk> 're new so lets see what you do with a crazy <unk> requests from my super 
 i go upstairs and there is this lady shouting about how she just ca n't stand to have other people touching *her* computer 
 she is having such a meltdown that she 's pretty much driven all of her fellow humans & gt 10 <unk> away and they are keeping their distance oh dear 
 i attempt to get a description of what happened from her telling another tech had been to her desk earlier that day and had <unk> all her files 
 i look at him poor guy keeping a safe distance with with all the other refugees and ask him what he did 
 apparently he had originally been called because her pc was slow he had looked around and found the usual monster stash of temporary files registry <unk> you know the stuff <unk> <unk> out with minimal fuss 
 he had also noticed that her recycle bin was <unk> with some 11 gb worth of files you probably see where we 're going by now 
 so he like any tech <unk> by that much bloat emptied it 
 turns out the lady had been <unk> her work by <unk> the delete <unk> 
 upon being asked why the hell she thought that was a sound strategy for saving important documents in nicer language of course she said well it 's the easiest way to do <unk> i only need to hit one button i know where they end up and i knew i could always get them back 
 i started to explain to her that doing that was like parking your car in a scrap yard and then getting <unk> when the guys who work there send it the the <unk> in nicer language of course 
 i quickly gave up fished out my handy portable <unk> usb and spent an extra hour and a half recovering files that she could remember while she insisted on acting like her actions were remotely logical 
 so this happened back in august when north and south korea fired a few rockets back and forth 
 i had been stationed here for 3 weeks when <unk> put up those giant speakers that play <unk> and <unk> <unk> got all pissy and shot a few rockets at them and <unk> <unk> 
 well i just so happened to be stationed here when all that kicked off and was working nights <unk> 
 not any more 
 i get the call around 4pm to come in it 's urgent we need all hands on deck to get the general 's phones and what not up 
 okay normally our day shift would handle it but with the act of <unk> everyone and their mother is getting called in and i get tasked to the 3 star 's room to set up his iptv in the bunker 
 is it up yet '' 
 the colonel asks me 
 again 
 and again 
 and again 
 no sir '' i 'm jamming away at my desk configuring the new switch and scope for his office 
 everyone is freaking out it 's the apocalypse and he needs his systems up and running now and the colonel is making sure i know that 
 finally get the switch up and running with the colonel breathing down my neck rack that bitch in the <unk> closet patch everything back to his office all with mr. nosey right behind asking me when i was going to be finished every step of the way 
 i finally get everything set up in his office phones are up all his different networks are <unk> up and ready to go his iptv is live 
 the man is set 
 finally after i finish this i am pouring sweat because it is hot as hell in korea in august and we are not allowed to have cars while we are stationed here so i had made a nice long walk to work the three star comes in and sees my sloppy mess and the full bird standing beside me 
 he takes one look at me and tells me that i look like hell ca n't disagree with that then asks me one question 
 so does this mean i can watch football in my office now with the iptv '' 
 i 'm a little taken back by that considering the current events that had taken place 
 i was n't used to the <unk> between the two countries so was a little worried 
 <unk> yes sir should be good to go '' 
 hell yeah appreciate it '' 
 and that was the first and only time i have talked to the three <unk> fan of this subreddit 
 have n't seen a story like this posted but i 'm sure this is a common <unk> in our field 
 i 'll try to keep the <unk> details to a minimum to protect the guilty 
 about a year prior to this story $ company had created an energy conglomerate of sorts - instead of towns and cities buying power straight from the power company they 'd buy through $ company 
 because they were buying in bulk '' $ company would get a discount on all that <unk> juice and pass some of that discount onto the towns in the conglomerate 
 i was the new guy in it and i had finished all of my assignments so i went around to different employees asking what i could do or make to make their lives easier 
 turns out the current it staff was pretty <unk> trying to <unk> all the old stuff so my offer to make new stuff quickly made me a favorite among the employees - well all but one 
 the power company did n't like the idea that they were selling the same amount of power but now at a lower price 
 they had a tool to check account information month by month power usage on and off peak price per <unk> hour etc but the tool requires you to enter the account numbers one at a time presumably to slow down anyone like us who wanted to manage multiple accounts 
 anyway i started asking one woman if she had any computer troubles and she started going on and on about how difficult her job was 
 it boiled down to her keeping an excel sheet of all of the account numbers for every account in every town or city in the conglomerate and a column for every piece of information the web app would give you 
 she 'd copy the account number into the web app hit go then copy each number into the excel sheet 
 there were hundreds of accounts 
 it took her 3 months to finish a single month 's data retrieval 
 i took a look at what she was actually doing and found that when she typed in an account number the web app would just use php 's $ <unk> to craft a url which included that number 
 i wrote a script that made a url for every account number then scraped the html for the different pieces of data on the page 
 i also dealt with various bugs in their system i had to add a delay if you checked pages too often it would effectively start blocking you either to prevent this behavior or because i was <unk> their system 
 anyway about an hour of programming then three hours of letting the program run and i had automated this woman 's three month <unk> 
 we had our weekly meeting and i showed the woman her boss and my boss the tool 
 i presented it while happily smiling in much the same way that a sad person would frown 
 everyone was excited by the massive drop in workload ... except the woman whose job i apparently just automated 
 it turns out that what i thought was a description of a difficulty was actually her way of <unk> '' about the difficulty of her job like a surgeon might tell you about a recent heart <unk> that he fixed blindfolded while playing <unk> that was the only thing she did for the company 
 she had no <unk> skills and spent the last year training herself in the muscle memory of the locations of the copy and paste options were on the right click menus ctrl+c & amp amp <unk> would have changed her life as well 
 she was not pleased 
 she was even less pleased when she was fired the next week after her boss had failed to find something else she could do 
 tldr : i turned <unk> into daily human into script happy into sad and a full salary with benefits into <unk> 
 and i never saw a penny of the money i saved them because i was <unk> for a well known it company customer comes in for their appointment with a laptop that 's made out of aluminium with a very visible dent by the charging port 
 & gt hello how can i help you today 
 & gt right ... basically i was using my laptop last night doing some work went to go plug it in and after around <unk> mins the charging area on the side here started melting on my lap i had to pull out the charging cable and now it 's like this i know it 's out of warranty but i 'm sorry i think it 's unacceptable for it to melt on me ... *i pause for a moment look at the machine then back up at him* & gt it melted 
 & gt yes melted you can see it here *points to the charging port area where its <unk> & gt right urm are you sure 
 did you go to hospital 
 *i go onto google and type in aluminium melting point '' * & gt yes i 'm sure no i chucked it on the carpet before it touched me so i 'm ok why 
 *i show him my tablet with the google result of <unk> <unk> & gt well just a few things first in order for it to melt it 'd have to get up to this temperature but in addition to that the plastic at the back of your ethernet port which is next to it is untouched and if you chucked it on the carpet i 'm pretty positive your house would have burnt down are you sure it melted 
 <unk> very young child comes <unk> in with his mum* & gt oh daddy has the man said he can fix the computer i dropped 
 man how i cried with laughter after that <unk> 
 edit - lol that blew up <unk> in <unk> i worked the phones for a <unk> that provided outsourced tech-support services for an industry giant in the realm of american multinational computer technology corporations '' 
 my <unk> numbers were never very good and i was constantly being told to bring my call times down from the <unk> minute mark to under 16 as per the service agreement with said corporation 
 while most of my co-workers had no problem dumping their callers as soon as possible earning a big pat on the back from the floor managers i was not able to just push my clients back into the endless cycle of <unk> minute wait times 
 my <unk> resolution rate of 90 % or better however was always at the top of the chart 
 nobody gave a rat 's ass about that though 
 for anyone that has been in my shoes you 'll agree that trying to actually *fix* a problem in under 16 minutes is pretty difficult 
 add the fact that most customers vent on you for about 10 minutes before you can start to help them and there is n't much that you can do if you are in the business of actually supporting the system 
 so i made the decision to ignore my <unk> as much as the managers would let me and just try to fix everything as quickly as i could 
 there were times when they would just hover and stare at me if they saw that my timer was over 
 one particular day i end up on a call with a nice elderly woman 
 she was 75 and had received her computer as a christmas gift from her son who had put the service account in her name 
 what her son <unk> to do however was get her a warranty that included service to go along with her replacement parts 
 in <unk> through the log of her ordeal with our technicians '' i find that i am her <unk> call to support in 2 days 
 she had originally called to ask about error messages that she was receiving and had been taken through <unk> <unk> system restore the dreaded <unk> <unk> windows me no less and finally a motherboard replacement 
 how she was not filled with rage and fury is still beyond me 
 instead of the <unk> tirade that i had come to expect muriel was very pleasant 
 i just received your <unk> and i am ready to go '' 
 it took a moment for it to sink in but it was n't long before the realization hit 
 i had to walk this lady through a motherboard install 
 while it occurred to me that most of my co-workers would have gone as far as to just dump the call by hitting the release button on their phone i felt obligated to put an end to this saga 
 muriel we are going to need a <unk> <unk> for this 
 do you have one handy '' 
 i have one right here '' 
 she was ready to rock 
 while she was waiting in the queue she had managed to <unk> all of the external cables and get the case onto her dining room table 
 i opened my <unk> <unk> <unk> of the shift 
 it was on 
 she followed every instruction with <unk> and passion as if she had been preparing all her life for this moment 
 i could hear her <unk> and occasionally cursing under her breath as her <unk> old fingers <unk> for dropped screws in the bottom of the case 
 i could mark the end of most steps with the signature <unk> '' of a card or cable being <unk> free of its slot 
 others she would confirm with a simple ok got it 
 what 's next '' 
 when the pci cards went back in i would add make sure it 's seated nice and securely '' 
 to her refrain it 's in there '' 
 45 minutes later the tower was back under the desk for the first of what i figured would be many attempts at getting the system to fire up 
 the managers were <unk> nervously trying their best to signal me to finish the call 
 i smiled and waved 
 ok muriel let 's try the power button 
 be sure to let me know what you see on the screen '' 
 i listened closely and prepared to count the post beeps 
 one beep 
 what do you see muriel '' 
 there was some white writing on a black screen but now it says windows me '' 
 that 's a great sign 
 is the light on the floppy drive lit '' 
 in the thousands of times i had re-seated a floppy cable my success rate at getting it the right side up the first time had to have been less than 10 % 
 it was for a second but it 's off now '' 
 <unk> one boot 
 impossible 
 i had her look through the device manager for <unk> '' <unk> '' for which there were none 
 i had her launch her office applications and open a few of her documents without any issues 
 play an audio cd 
 check 
 i even went as far as to have her test her internet connection aol dial-up which required i call her back 
 no problems there either 
 i was in awe 
 we had just completed an entire motherboard replacement with 100 % accuracy in 45 minutes 
 sometimes it would take users 15 minutes to find the my computer icon 
 muriel this has been the single greatest call i have ever been a part of 
 you can now tell your friends that you have assembled a computer from scratch '' 
 she <unk> 
 i had a lot of fun but i hope you do n't take it the wrong way when i say that i hope to never have to speak to any of you ever again '' 
 **tl dr : i walked an old lady through a motherboard replacement in 45 minutes 
 ** edit : you guys are awesome 
 i am truly humbled 
 if i would have known i would have said muriel one day i will post on reddit about this and technicians <unk> will cheer 
 during my uni days i felt i needed to have a proper job on the side particularly one that i would n't ashamed of telling people about 
 up to that point all my jobs had revolved around annoying others e.g 
 telemarketing doing survey 's on the street things like that 
 now i wanted to do something useful that people would actually appreciate so i applied for a job at the university 's tech support team 
 i in no way had sufficient skills or experience to deal with tech support issues but i was hired anyway and learned a lot as i went 
 there was a professor of one of the <unk> departments who was infamous for constantly ringing up and get really agitated / condescending about all kinds of things that were supposedly wrong with her computer 
 of course the first time she called they immediately <unk> her to the new guy : me 
 she was really worked up and told me i had to come over immediately '' 
 i asked her what the problem was and she yelled : my computer is infected with a virus 
 it 's <unk> my privacy by showing my password to everybody '' 
 i had no idea what it could be but i was pretty sure she was not even capable of getting a virus installed <unk> or not 
 so i went over there to see what she was going on about 
 when i got there i did n't see anything out of the ordinary on her screen 
 so i asked her to follow the same steps that caused the issue before and this was the result : * to quickly get to <unk> university webmail she had placed a shortcut to the web page on her desktop 
 * she would double click the shortcut icon but at such a slow pace that the clicks were registered as two individual clicks instead 
 * of course the first click caused the shortcut icon to be selected while the second click made its caption text <unk> 
 * now focusing on the her own fingers and ignoring the screen she assumed the login page had loaded and that she could start typing her password to log into her mail account 
 * as she typed her password she would replace the highlighted shortcut caption text with her password and press enter intended to submit the login form but actually confirming the caption text edit 
 * and lo her password was displayed on screen for all to see 
 she looked at me <unk> as if she had just proven a discovery that had somehow slipped by our team 
 all of a sudden i felt i was going to be alright at this job despite my lack of experience 
 edit : <unk> short one that i 've just experienced and had to share 
 i work for a local authority and our most frequent user issues come from social workers 
 i did n't have any contact with people from that profession before i took this job but they all just seem to be ... stupid 
 not just computer illiterate but in general not a very bright bunch 
 as evidenced by this exchange 
 & gt **sw** : hi i reset my password yesterday but it 's not working today 
 & gt **me** : that 's fine i can just reset it 
 ... ok that 's done 
 your new password is just <unk> that 's with a capital p. & gt **sw** : <unk> <unk> ok ... password ... 1 ... with a capital 't 
 & gt **me** : err ... no 'p 
 puh puh 
 as in 'password 
 & gt **sw** : 't then 
 & gt **me** : ... there is no 't in 'password & gt **sw** : oh yeah right enough 
 at first i thought he was joking with me albeit badly but he got really worked up at having to repeat himself 
 *edit* i fail at formatting *edit2* guys i think we all just need to agree that p for password p for <unk> and p for <unk> are all the same p. also i 'm never getting in a pool with any of you 
 *edit3* as has already been suggested roughly 400 times he was not <unk> man the it help desk for the faculty of medicine in a university 
 as the buildings we support are fairly spread out we try to do as much remote support as we can 
 we therefore have <unk> as a part of our standard image 
 this morning $ user called up asking to have skype installed on her computer 
 it was a desktop so she did n't have admin privileges 
 no biggie 
 i ask her for her ip address 
 since most of our users draw a blank when i ask this i then guide them through checking it by hovering their mouse over the vnc icon in the task bar 
 our repeat offenders however know the drill and sometimes will give the address to us straight away 
 great <unk> time 
 i remote in and install skype 
 while still connected she asks me a question about her webcam 
 as i 'm replying notepad opens in the remote session 
 inside notepad the following appears 
 who is this 
 what are you doing to my computer 
 i demand to know who you are and where you are connecting from 
 turns out my dear friend $ user had written down her ip address on to a sticky note three months ago thinking that it would never change 
 i had just freaked out some poor staff member by taking control of their mouse and keyboard while they were in the middle of writing their <unk> 
 oops 
 i quickly found out $ user 's real ip address installed skype and ended the call so i could find out who the other staff member was and contact them to explain 
 i then had to deal half an hour of ranting about how bloody insecure our system is if just anyone can connect at any time do n't we have anything better to do breach of privacy etc 
 <unk> this sub really dies during the weekends 
 i 've mentioned my grandmother in the comments before 
 i thought that i 'd share a short story about her this lazy sunday 
 my grandmother is <unk> yo and looks like a typical sweet old lady 
 she is also really small 
 since she is that old she has been around for the entire <unk> of modern computing and is thus naturally very good with computers 
 why this does n't seem to apply to other old people is beyond me 
 a couple of years ago my aunt took grandma to the hospital for a routine checkup 
 my aunt waited outside the room as grandma was examined by a doctor 
 after a while a nurse came out of the room and rushed past my aunt only to return with another doctor a moment later 
 both disappeared back into the room without a word 
 just as my aunt started to wonder what was going on the nurse came rushing out again <unk> yet another doctor 
 my aunt started to worry what medical crisis could possibly require three doctors 
 luckily the nurse did n't close the door properly the last time so my aunt decided to take a peek inside 
 grandma was sitting on the bed surrounded by the three doctors who were all taking notes 
 & gt grandma : ... do n't go for the cheapest models they break down quickly and the software is harder to use ... she was teaching the doctors how to <unk> old picture slides and what scanner to get 
 at the time grandma was spending a lot of time scanning slides which she apparently had mentioned to the first doctor 
 the doctor and her two colleagues all had major collections of picture slides but had no idea that you now can scan them yourself 
 they were pretty amazed 
 edit : since this story got popular i called my aunt to confirm because i wrote this from memory 
 apparently the actual quote was even better : & gt '' listen doctor do you even know what a scanner is 
 some days i find myself questioning whether the end <unk> the means 
 if a lie improves the lives of all parties involved is it not in the end a good thing 
 can this <unk> be <unk> or is it one of the small degrees by which a man inexplicably slides towards the <unk> 
 & gt **boss : ** i just had $ <unk> in my office 
 did you tell her it would take *a full <unk> to install a critical update on her computer 
 & gt **me : ** words to that effect may have been said yes 
 & gt **boss : ** is n't this the update that took *five <unk> including reboot on my computer 
 & gt **me : ** yes 
 & gt **boss : ** then what are the other 55 minutes for 
 & gt *we stared each other down over the last cup of coffee neither willing to give the other any grounds 
 * heh & gt **me : ** how much is five minutes 
 & gt **boss : ** almost nothing 
 but that does n't answer my question ... & gt **me : ** but it does 
 five minutes is almost nothing 
 *and that 's the problem 
 * to you and me a task that takes five minutes is a good thing 
 it 's done quickly 
 you show up get stuff done and bob 's your uncle mum 's the word and drop <unk> are real 
 but to someone who has spent the last three years convinced her monitor is a touch screen a five minute task is something that can be put off <unk> 
 if i tell her it 's a five minute job she will keep me from doing it right up until i have to put on my <unk> <unk> and dive into <unk> mass of excrement 
 & gt **boss : ** but if you tell her it will take a full hour ... & gt **me : ** ... she 'll find the time to let me do it because it 's important 
 & gt **boss : ** and she 'll be happy because you came in under your estimate 
 & gt **me : ** exactly 
 & gt **boss : ** all right whatever 
 can you make some more coffee 
 & gt **me : ** sure just give me an <unk> is happening right now 
 client came in wants a website have the design <unk> so we skip the first few steps on the workflow 
 his design is in photoshop files and our guys are <unk> it into html <unk> are coding it etc etc 
 everything fine and a few days later we upload it to a test site for the client to approve it 
 we walked <unk> some days of ridiculous demands all coming down to his design being <unk> and not really working for him 
 but since we are the good guys we are changing things on his demands 
 the interesting things started the next morning 
 & gt **client** : the website is not ok at all 
 when i view it on my iphone it looks all different 
 & gt **my boss** : this is normal - we had to fit the elements somehow to fit smaller <unk> 
 it is responsive website after all 
 & gt **client** : no i do n't want it like that 
 make it look 1:1 as the provided design 
 & gt **my boss** : you understand the design you provided is made for <unk> right 
 it ca n't <unk> to smaller screens like on a tablet or on your phone 
 & gt **client** : i do n't want it <unk> 
 i want it to look 1:1 
 & gt **my boss** : ... this ca n't happen without having the website being unreadable on smaller screens 
 you wanted us to make a responsive website right 
 & gt **client** : of course i wanted responsive 
 just do n't change anything on it 
 & gt **my boss** : what does <unk> means for you 
 & gt **client** : it means i can open the website on my iphone 
 & gt **my boss** : you want to open it on your iphone but how would you view it there 
 only a small portion of the website will fit your screen 
 you will have a massive horizontal and <unk> scrollbars and the font size will be absolutely tiny 
 & gt **client** : yes like that 
 all normal websites have scrollbars 
 i want scrollbars 
 update : right now my boss just finally fired the client 
 it went like this : & gt **client** : the site is not good again 
 i can view only a portion of it on my screen 
 **boss** : yes because your design is <unk> wide and this is the design you approved and wanted to do it exactly 1:1 with frozen elements 
 **client** : it is not looking good see for example site x 
 how are they doing it 
 **boss** : site x uses narrow <unk> centered design yours is way bigger than that 
 you ca n't have it to <unk> fully on smaller screens 
 it is technically not possible with the design you approved 
 **client** : what do you mean <unk> possible 
 do n't tell me it is not possible i see it done on site x 
 this went for a couple of minutes then a few <unk> were exchanged stating that we are unprofessional and not a serious <unk> 15 years ago my boss asked me to set up an april fool 's joke script to run when people log in to our internal application 
 it has survived several server <unk> and is still running today and still getting people who forget about it

 i would get calls from all sorts of people from office workers to <unk> to software developers 
 of the whole year i worked there one particular call stood out to me the most 
 $ hugeorganization obviously had rules about not letting users share their passwords and if we found out this was happening we were supposed to quietly lock out their account after the call was over 
 one day i get what appeared t be a standard call from a user 
 he needs help with his program that he 's using 
 he has n't rebooted the computer yet so i have him do that real quick for me 
 when he goes to log into the computer i hear a couple beeps over the phone but we hear weird noises all the time so i disregard it 
 so i <unk> into his machine and do some basic troubleshooting with the program and after a few things i have him open the program and log into it 
 when he goes to login he places his cursor in the username field i hear the beep again and the field fills out immediately 
 password does the same thing 
 what the heck 
 & gt me : what are you doing to login 
 & gt user : oh i got tired of typing in my information so i printed it out as a barcode and put it on my desk 
 i scan it with the barcode gun on my computer 
 & gt me : wow 
 never would have though of that ... this guy’s idea was so awesome i just didn’t have the heart to screw him over just because the rules say 
 and plus it’s not like his password is actually <unk> <unk> plus who can read barcode 
 tl : dr – genius warehouse worker never has to type his password again by printing it out as a barcode 
 short story time 
 my gf and i had been dating for awhile so it was time to do that whole hey come meet my family so they can judge you '' thing 
 which to be honest is still fairly terrifying as an older <unk> 
 about halfway into dinner her dad starts complaining about his phone <unk> new technology this ... damn $ <unk> that ... back in my day yadda <unk> ... turns out his touch screen had stopped working - win 8 phone ... surprise 
 - and the company had told him over the phone he was going to have to come in and get it replaced at the low low cost of 200 bucks ... gf mentioned i knew a thing or two about tech because as we all know being the person known for being techie '' automatically gets you <unk> out as tech help to <unk> strangers in a line at the grocery store and that i should have a look at it ... no problem '' says i of course still trying to make a good first impression ... two minutes of <unk> to pull up which keys to press to get his phone to do a <unk> and it works perfectly 
 best part - he turns to me and says son you can come over and drink my beer and watch hockey on the big screen any time you want '' 
 my office had one of its lights out which made it slightly gloomy 
 the gloom cast a shadow over half my face as i spoke i decided that was acceptable 
 the light stayed broken 
 the head of marketing had entered my office in dramatic fashion 
 he’d swung the door wide jumped through the opening and rushed to the desk 
 slamming down a mouse and glaring into my relaxed posture with an accusatory stare 
 i decided i wasn’t a drama fan 
 & gt me : that’s a mouse 
 i decided clear <unk> statements are the opposite of what a good drama <unk> would do 
 they like to stay in the realm of <unk> 
 & gt headmarketing : no ... ... ... ... ... head of marketing stopped 
 <unk> out the silence between us 
 leaving a long pregnant pause 
 & gt headmarketing : that’s a <unk> mouse 
 i picked up the offending <unk> and examined it closely 
 i gave a few <unk> at the wire then smiled broadly 
 & gt me : so it is 
 head of marketing looked confusedly at my actions 
 i internally <unk> my opinions on the situation perhaps this could be a comedy yet 
 & gt headmarketing : i want a <unk> mouse 
 last week when i went up to accounting they’d already received wireless mice 
 in what world does <unk> get wireless mice but designers do not 
 & gt me : apparently this one ... no wonder head of marketing is so dramatic he thinks he’s a designer 
 i smiled at the thought of rectifying this obvious oversight 
 & gt headmarketing : you can’t <unk> *us* with wires 
 why do accountants who use keyboards all day get wireless whilst those of us who actually use our mice get wired 
 & gt me : the world is a strange place 
 accountants <unk> by the wires of their mice can work from wherever they want but alas the marketing department least loved of all the departments are chained to their desks 
 <unk> to the wired mice they so <unk> on 
 & gt headmarketing : are you ... 
 are you <unk> me 
 i realized i’d probably gone a little far 
 trying to hide the smile i continued 
 & gt me : lets just see how long this cord is 
 i stretched the cord out on the desk 
 its total length was around 5 feet 
 & gt me : so you need wireless mice so you can work ... at greater then 5 feet away from the computer 
 & gt headmarketing : it’s not so much the distance as it is the wire 
 it gets in the way 
 you can’t expect good designs and clean <unk> to come when the artist is continually moving cords 
 it breaks the flow 
 it breaks the flow 
 i looked again closely at the offending wired mouse it was surprisingly good quality 
 unlike most mice at work it had a high dpi 
 replacing this mouse with the low quality wireless junk we had would actually be a downgrade 
 & gt me : listen this mouse it’s better dpi then anything we offer 
 a higher dpi means ... & gt headmarketing : <unk> will get me my wireless <unk> not only had head of marketing cut me off he’d also grabbed the mouse away from me 
 i watched in shock as he <unk> over my desk 
 & gt headmarketing : go get me a wireless mouse ... drama thats clearly all he wanted 
 i’d tried for comedy i’d tried for <unk> 
 no 
 he wanted drama 
 & gt me : no 
 let me explain exactly why i won’t do that 
 head of marketing grabbed the <unk> off my desk and in one quick <unk> cut the cord on the mouse in his hand 
 in his moment of victory he smiled down at me 
 i sat in my chair oddly impressed he’d actually just cut a cord in front of me 
 i decided i’d had enough of drama 
 i waited 
 it was a long pause before he spoke again 
 & gt headmarketing : *oh no 
 * looks like i need a new mouse 
 perhaps you could go get me one 
 i’d prefer wireless 
 & gt me : i’m afraid as i was trying to explain 
 we’ve none left 
 also you just destroyed property in front of me 
 headmarketing didn’t seemed <unk> at all by this he looked like he just wanted to leave 
 he spotted a very old mouse sitting next to an ancient computer grabbed it and started walking off 
 **** about twenty minutes later i got a call 
 & gt headmarketing : this mouse doesn’t have the right cord thingy 
 & gt me : doesn’t it 
 that’s weird 
 i’ll get you a new one 
 i went searching around the department for the worst mouse 
 i finally found one 
 it was an old ball mouse with a usb input 
 its rollers were as dirty as sin the entire ball continually stuck at one point or another 
 even better for reasons no one could fathom the cord was only 2 feet long 
 & gt headmarketing : thanks so much ... head of marketing took stock of the mouse i was attempting to give him 
 i plugged it into the back of his computer and the mouse only made it half way to where his mouse pad was normally placed 
 i moved the mouse pad 
 & gt headmarketing : what the 
 this mouse has a tiny cord 
 & gt me : i know 
 it’s <unk> <unk> claim to <unk> comes from a few years ago 
 i was working 2nd line support at a company making hotel and hospitality software room <unk> databases point of sale stuff etc 
 the point of sale pos stuff was written in <unk> and was basically garbage 
 the pos hardware itself was a pc with a <unk> touchscreen and a cash drawer 
 the cash drawer was always fun to set up and then setup again when the settings were inevitably lost 
 we 'd connect in over vnc and then send a selection of commands to any com ports on the pc until the drawer popped open 
 from memory there were <unk> possible command strings and and <unk> com ports 2 physical <unk> through usb converter if used 
 needless to say this took some time and we had to be sure someone was nearby when testing as there was never a response to a command and the drawer could be full of cash 
 so there i was talking to a fairly reasonable bar manager at lunch time trying to sort out his pos which suddenly would n't open the cash drawer 
 i did the usual thing of letting him know not to <unk> off leaving an open drawer full of cash and to let me know when the drawer opens send command ... nothing send command ... nothing send command ... nothing send command ... nothing ... send command ... 
 <unk> '' 
 that was n't usually the response i got when i fixed something 
 after a few seconds the bar manager told me through <unk> teeth that the drawer had popped open right into his <unk> 
 **tl dr** i punched someone in the nuts over the internet 
 living the dream 
 oh my 
 gold 
 thanks kind stranger my mother despite being in her mid 60 's is awesome with computers 
 she 's a public librarian and is often at the wrong end of users questions 
 i came home for a quick mother 's day visit and she told me this gem : user : i ca n't copy this highlighted section 
 this mouse must be broken 
 mom : just press the control and c keys at the same time 
 yes that 'll copy it 
 now hit the control and v keys at the same time 
 user : v 
 why not p 
 mom : v stands for <unk> so when you paste it it 'll stick 
 user : <unk> ok 
 that makes sense 
 tl dr- my mom is amazing 
 many years ago someone decided that all our servers would be named after green things and all our networked printers would be named after movie stars 
 so we had servers names envy <unk> hulk <unk> etc 
 and printers named <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> etc 
 one day i received a call from someone who was upset about the name of the printer in her new office 
 let 's call her crazed new office worker cnow 
 & gt djxiii : it servicedesk djxiii speaking 
 & gt cnow : hello i 'd like to request that the printer in our office receive a proper name 
 the one it has now is offensive 
 & gt djxiii : a networked printer 
 which office are you in 
 & gt cnow : i 'm in the academic and career prep offices 
 i do n't know why our printer is named this way 
 in my old office we had a nicely named printer named after meg <unk> 
 i do a <unk> and see that the printer in her new office is named garland '' after judy garland 
 & gt djxiii : yes all our network printers are named after <unk> 
 do you want the one in your area named after a different <unk> 
 & gt cnow : i think they must have missed ours 
 it 's named <unk> 
 ** i do n't know what that is supposed to mean but i have <unk> <unk> and i know what nads are 
 it 's definitely inappropriate 
 & gt djxiii : i think you are just reading it wrong 
 the name of the printer is judy garland or just garland for short 
 & gt cnow : thank you for you time 
 *click* i have often wondered if she had <unk> or if it was just a case of being a bit overwhelmed with the change of office 
 one of our network guys started using <unk> as his <unk> handle not long after that 
 tl : dr user <unk> name of printer and thinks it is offensive 
 edit : great <unk> 
 i 've earned a <unk> tag 
 never <unk> the power of nads 
 edit2 : quote of the day 
 *wipes a <unk> hello again tfts 
 so today i finally had a <unk> moment of putting a customer squarely in his place and i thought i 'd share 
 <unk> : i work at a large isp that deals mostly with rural american areas 
 & gt angryman : i ca n't connect to anything in my house 
 your internet does n't work 
 this service is awful 
 hmm ... sounds like his wifi is n't working 
 we 've got ta verify that his internet is still up and running at all and then check the modem 's firmware 
 & gt uwbw : okay sir let 's start with this ... do you currently have a computer plugged into your modem 
 & gt angryman : yes of course it is 
 i have a special computer for my special programming 
 & gt uwbw : okay good 
 so let 's see if we can get to <unk> on that computer 
 & gt angryman : ... & gt uwbw : sir 
 are you able to get to <unk> & gt angryman : why the **** do i need to go to google 
 & gt uwbw : well sir i need to see if it 's your wifi going down or your actual internet connection 
 & gt angryman : fine ... silence reigns for a while as i absentmindedly watch one of the tvs in our center play an old <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 after about three minutes of silence i check in with the guy 
 & gt uwbw : sir 
 are you able to access <unk> & gt angryman : listen punk i have a degree in programming 
 i know that my internet is n't working okay 
 i 'm not gon na do your dumb troubleshooting just fix it 
 & gt uwbw : sir with all due respect i- & gt angryman : what 
 i bet you do n't know a thing about computers 
 do you have a degree in computer programming 
 huh 
 do you 
 & gt uwbw : yes sir 
 & gt angryman : ... what 
 & gt uwbw : yes sir i do have a degree in computer programming and computer science 
 & gt angryman : ... oh 
 and he shut the hell up after that and let me do my job 
 yay 
 edit : wow this really blew up huh 
 thanks for all the support guys 
 it 's moments like these that make this job for me : p also for those of you wondering it 's a computer science minor 
 i just <unk> it like that so the guy was firmly put in his place 
 communication major for the rest of you <unk> me state this plainly and clearly for everyone : there is nothing that will <unk> and destroy a project with a greater efficiency than a project manager 
 in my 20+ years of doing this sort of thing i have never found a project manager that can manage a project and i 've found quite a few that ca n't even manage their own lives 
 i am <unk> % convinced that if all the people who 's only job is project manager '' were gathered up and put on a small <unk> island then had a nuclear weapon dropped on them they would survive for two reasons : 1 the only thing to survive a nuclear <unk> would be <unk> and pm 's and 2 the bomb would never actually <unk> due to the project managers <unk> the explosion for a few weeks while they try to get a few nuclear weapon <unk> involved to discuss the explosion with the bomb in a conference call that the bomb was forced to attend and during that meeting the pm 's had some questions that could n't be answered by anyone on the phone so they 're going to setup another call next tuesday at 11 and send the invite to the people that need to be there to answer those questions but before the tuesday meeting the pm 's spoke with the question <unk> during an email chain containing <unk> people and they are now confused by the word <unk> '' because they were under the impression that we were going to be <unk> '' the bomb and now they need to rewrite the project plan with this new information and they 'll attach the plan to a new meeting invite so we can go over the plan to make sure that it 's correct and by the time that meeting starts the bomb 's batteries will have died and it will be <unk> useless 
 the only thing worse than a project manager is a project manager that refuses to do anything about the project being <unk> 
 since <unk> i have been working on a project to archive a bunch of data 
 this requires creating 3 or 4 new <unk> statements and opening some ports on the firewalls 
 we have a <unk> meeting on <unk> and fridays scheduled for 1 hour in which we 're supposed to discuss the project we 're working on 
 there 's two pms involved in this project because we split it into two parts 
 <unk> we 'll call her pebbles '' is a complete moron 
 before she became a pm she worked in hr and this the first project she 's managed alone 
 she 's never worked in it and does n't know anything about it 
 she 's also the person that emailed me this with 11 people cc 'd : & gt <unk> thanks for attending the call today 
 i have a couple questions that thought would be better answered offline so we did n't make the meeting go over 
 you said in the call that you needed to poke a couple holes in the firewall '' 
 since you 're not onsite who are you going to get to create the holes and are they going to fill the holes back in after we 're done with the project 
 how long does it take to make the holes and how long to fill them 
 are you poking holes so we can run cables and if so do i need to get our electrical contractor involved to run the cables for you 
 since this is a firewall would n't it be a fire hazard to have holes in it 
 let me know so i can add it to the project plan and meeting minutes i 'll be sending out '' 
 i shit you not ... she really did ask that 
 pm # 2 we 'll call him bamm-bamm '' has a very unique skill 
 he 's the only man in the world that can talk for an entire hour and never say anything 
 his favorite phrase is so let me get this straight ... '' afterwards he will repeat everything the person just said but he will take 8 minutes to say something like so you need to open ports on the firewall before we can move any data '' 
 it 's not that he talks slow quite the opposite he just does n't say anything of substance 
 it 's hard to describe but imagine having a gun to your head and the person holding the gun told you that you had to describe how to walk across a room but you had to speak in your normal <unk> and if you repeated yourself or stopped talking in the next 30 minutes he 'd kill you 
 that what this sounds like ... lots of <unk> words and fluff that add absolutely nothing to the conversation other than to make the 10 minute call last the full 60 minutes scheduled 
 bamm-bamm has also never worked in it and requires extensive <unk> for everything 
 stuff like what do you mean <unk> 
 can you explain <unk> to me 
 oh it 's encrypted 
 how 
 does the other engineer know how to use the sftp 
 have you tested this in the lab environment '' 
 anyway back to the story at hand 
 this project was supposed to be completed by may <unk> now it appears that it wo n't be complete until the middle of july 
 it took me 3 months to get the other side to do the required changes routing statements <unk> rules for the machines on both sides to communicate 
 i spent two weeks trying to troubleshoot an issue with the servers not communicating only to finally get the dba on the other side to share his screen with me while he was trying to connect and saw that he was using our <unk> '' name to connect rather than the public ip addresses i gave him 
 he then stopped because he 's never used an ip to connect before and did n't feel comfortable doing it so he had to wait until someone over there could edit the hosts file on the server so he could use the <unk> name rather than the ip 
 this database admin had no idea what dns was or how it works 
 when i attempted to contact pebbles and bamm-bamm 's boss about how they were destroying this project she got involved and screwed it up even worse 
 what is it about large companies that they think they can hire people to do a job they do n't know how to do and it will all turn out peachy in the end 
 why would you hire someone that 's never worked in it as an it project manager 
 would you hire a <unk> that ca n't <unk> 
 would you hire a blind race car driver 
 it’s easy to forget in these modern usb days that in simpler days there was no device detection or <unk> 
 you plugged something into a serial port or <unk> port configured the computer for the same <unk> the device was expecting and we were off 
 ah those simple glorious days 
 the serial port was indeed universal before it became the universal serial bus 
 but one class of device hasn’t forgotten those days - networking equipment 
 all serious routers switches and firewalls come with a <unk> baud rs232 serial port for configuring them 
 this may sound silly to people who grew up with usb as a standard but by the time you need access to the serial port of a network device you *really* need it 
 no drivers no compatibility just access 
 and for something like <unk> configuration it’s perfect 
 enter the modern age 
 serial ports on desktop pcs slowly fade into the history books and that <unk> <unk> adapter is all but forgotten .. but not for some 
 as these started to disappear from laptops ones that still had a physical serial port became highly sought after 
 the prolific <unk> converter was around but drivers were lacking and buggy at best unusable at worst 
 it was 2010 and i was still clinging desperately to my old work laptop 
 it had everything i needed - a serial port a gigabit ethernet port and wifi but the battery life was <unk> the case was cracked and it had not been <unk> in some time 
 the only thing i used it for was when i had to go downstairs to the datacentre to reconfigure something 
 and today i needed to reconfigure something 
 that’s when *it* happened 
 my laptop lost a battle with a bottle of water and was permanently dead 
 then it occured to me this is really stupid 
 i kept an entire computer for the sole purpose of being a serial port adapter 
 how wasteful and more importantly how <unk> able to be kept in my <unk> 
 what if i could use my phone as a serial port 
 it was a tiny *nix computer 
 i already had a terminal program on it 
 i searched and googled and searched and googled but no such device existed 
 that’s when i decided to build my own 
 my <unk> iphone had a 30 pin connector and i never knew what they were for so i set about doing some research into what they did and how people connected things to them 
 what i found was impressive that connector had audio in audio out usb <unk> video three lots of power and some mysterious ports labelled <unk> and <unk> 
 could it be 
 could the iphone have a serial port already that i could use 
 i’d been <unk> that i’d need to port osx prolific drivers to ios but could it really be as simple as just wiring them up 
 i bought a <unk> board from an electronics store online and that night plugged it in fired up <unk> a terminal emulator and started messing with it but no matter what i did i couldn’t get anything to happen 
 that’s when i threw the <unk> on - it wasn’t rs232 but it might have been <unk> a <unk> version of the serial protocol 
 hell it was worth a shot 
 some more research and another trip to the electronics store 
 i picked up a <unk> <unk> chip which <unk> <unk> to rs232 a bunch of <unk> and wired it up 
 i connected it to the <unk> power output of the iphone 30 pin wired up the ground connected the <unk> <unk> pin to ground and then put the rx and tx on stuffed the whole thing inside a case and plugged it in and it worked 
 holy crap 
 i had never been so excited in my life 
 i was configuring my <unk> home router with my damn phone the next day i wrote a small post on my technical blog and then posted a link to a network operators group mailing list to share my discovery and posted a wiring diagram of how to do it the whole thing blew up like crazy 
 my article was <unk> hundreds of times 
 it got <unk> 
 it got featured in <unk> 
 people asked me to test it on an ipad so i did i got contacted by journalists 
 at this point i was starting to get a little nervous 
 this was in no way approved apple hardware and you had to <unk> the phone to get access to the serial port <unk> this was long before the <unk> it legal to <unk> debate was finished and i knew that apple had denied others use of the serial port for this exact thing 
 and without knowing it i’d made <unk> news that it was not only possible but posted a full set of instructions on how to do it 
 but as the days and weeks rolled by and nothing but requests to buy them came in i started to relax 
 i learnt pcb design and made <unk> 
 i <unk> the device to 1/4 its original size 
 i looked into manufacturing in australia but it was too expensive 
 i checked out the possibility of getting them made in china but no-one wanted to build the whole thing 
 it was only <unk> cases or assembly not all three 
 then *it* happened 
 a journalist contacted me to ask me what i thought of the security flaws in the iphone 
 i didn’t really know what he was talking about so i played it cool for a while until i had to ask him what the <unk> he was talking about 
 hackers had discovered a <unk> <unk> that could be activated at boot time .. using the serial port 
 my heart <unk> into my throat 
 my <unk> product that i was still promising to sell could be used to expose major vulnerabilities in the iphone 
 any and all chance of not getting a cease & amp <unk> letter from apple disappeared in an instant 
 i removed any mention of selling the devices from my site and <unk> the article as a <unk> <unk> then intentionally reversed the tx and rx pins in the schematic to prevent it from working for plausible <unk> 
 i kept my iphone serial port in my bag for years as a useful tool until i finally got a <unk> macbook pro which was small and light enough to live there instead and now that the prolific drivers didn’t suck i had no need for it anymore 
 i disassembled the <unk> and returned the electronics to my spare parts pile where they still live today 
 but for one <unk> moment i was internet famous the best <unk> of <unk> a past life i was an <unk> technician 
 i had quite a few interesting experiences good bad and otherwise 
 a few of them i can even share with all of you here 
 about ten years ago as a lowly <unk> tech i was told to <unk> the pilot first <unk> ever on the circumstances of a recurring problem with one of their systems 
 while delving into the how and when of the issue with one of the crew members the electronic <unk> officer $ edub pulls me aside and to ask me a question 
 his awkward nervousness was apparent 
 after about five minutes of beating it around the <unk> he asks his question 
 “i am not sure that my $ system is working correctly in offensive <unk> he says to me 
 there is no <unk> <unk> on $ system 
 there is a <unk> switch with four positions off <unk> test and <unk> 
 i inform him that there is no offensive mode 
 that that was the off as in offline position and that if the system is not powered on then that position is working as intended 
 instead of accepting that he is wrong $ edub becomes <unk> 
 he does not believe me 
 obviously if there is a <unk> position that means <unk> mode then there must also be an offensive mode off 
 he then proceeds to <unk> with the rest of the aircrew 
 they come to his <unk> only to <unk> him 
 after another <unk> minutes of disagreement the senior pilot suggests we go out to another jet and see who is right 
 they all watch as i go through the power on process which requires i drag a heavy power cord from the generator to the jet check breakers and finally flip the required switches 
 no one helps 
 once fully warmed up we check the systems 
 we flip the system to <unk> as part of the warm up cycle 
 ready lights come on 
 he flips it back to off the lights go out 
 $ edub turns to me with a self satisfied look and shouts “see 
 ” right in my face 
 i reply that this is functioning as designed 
 of course he won’t accept it 
 we move to another jet 
 different jet same results 
 at this point i am tired of <unk> up power and shutting down these <unk> 
 the aircrew have had their fun 
 now it is time for me to have mine 
 i suggest that we look at his operations manual 
 he didn’t bring his today 
 i am not surprised 
 one of the other crew members has one 
 i look up that system and guess what 
 off powers the system down as in turns it off 
 i point this out to him 
 he complains to my boss about my <unk> attitude 
 this story is dedicated to you <unk> the intern 
 <unk> have been changed to protect the <unk> around 2005 i worked for a major computer manufacturer doing consumer technical escalations 
 when you were so upset about your computer that you wrote to the corporate office i was one of the people you spoke to 
 i pretty much had leeway to do whatever it took to resolve the customer 's issue whether it 's issuing a refund sending a new computer giving away upgrades etc 
 however when it came to purchasing items from the company we had to go through the normal consumer channels to do so 
 if we had a problem with our purchases we also had to go through the same routine as anyone else in order to prevent abuse like improperly getting upgrades and the like 
 often times this meant that you 'd be routed to a call center in india 
 usually support was fine but just like anywhere else sometimes you have a bad <unk> 
 i ordered a refurbished pda online because they were on heavy discount 
 i had always been curious about them so i figured i 'd <unk> 
 i get the device that week and i 'm <unk> 
 until that is i try to plug headphones into the device 
 no sound 
 the headphone plug actually <unk> in the jack 
 i shine a flashlight into the jack ... there 's literally nothing in the jack 
 either the jack broke or there was n't one soldered on in the first place 
 i was surprised that this got past quality control 
 so on the phone i go calling tech support 
 i get india : & gt hello thanks for calling & lt <unk> & gt this is melissa '' how can i help you 
 & gt & gt hi i bought a refurbished pda from you 
 i receive it and there 's no headphone jack -- there 's a hole where one is supposed to be 
 & gt <unk> ... so you have a problem with sound from the headphones 
 have you made sure that the device is n't muted 
 & gt & gt yes ... it 's unmuted but i do n't see how that 's going to help the fact that there is no jack on the device at all 
 & gt yes sir ... mmm ... can you please turn the device off then back on and see what happens 
 & gt & gt sure 
 <unk> <unk> it 's back on 
 there 's still no headphone jack 
 & gt uh huh ... okay thank you sir 
 it seems like the settings might be corrupt 
 i need you to power the device down and when you turn it on please hold the button ... & gt & gt wait are you telling me to do a hard reset to bring the device back to factory defaults 
 how is that supposed to make the headphone jack appear 
 & gt <unk> ... well sir we wo n't know until we try 
 & gt & gt ... do you understand what i 'm telling you 
 we can do all we want with the software but physically there is no jack to plug headphones into 
 & gt ok. so shall we proceed to resetting the device to defaults now 
 she 's not getting this 
 i ask to speak to her supervisor 
 she puts me on hold comes back and tells me of course he 's not available 
 this is n't something you 're normally supposed to do but i pulled up my device 's serial number in our internal ticketing program 
 i see that she has already written up call notes and put a resolution in of customer had no sound 
 ensured device was unmuted settings now correct call resolved '' 
 oh *hell* no 
 she comes back on the phone and says & gt okay sir if we do n't reset the device we ca n't troubleshoot any further 
 is there anything else i can do for you 
 & gt & gt yes melissa '' or is it <unk> 
 i 'm a corporate escalations <unk> i just looked up this case in the ticketing system and it says you told me to reset my audio settings that i 'm already off the phone and the issue is resolved 
 you do realize that <unk> logs is a <unk> offense right 
 & gt um ... i ... uh ... & gt & gt please put your manager on the phone so that he can set up an exchange for this device 
 seconds later someone else is on the phone confirming my address 
 2 days later i have a replacement device that actually has a headphone jack 
 i know i might get some flak for coming down on a front-line tech so hard threatening firing for what she did 
 but i worked every day dealing with customers who got the same kind of runaround i just was n't going to let it stand 
 <unk> what makes this especially bad is that per our pda support process doing a factory reset on the device is something you 're supposed to walk the customer through but then you end the call so that they can finish going through the first time setup '' process 
 that process takes around <unk> minutes doing routine stuff like entering your name wifi information etc 
 once a customer does that they 're supposed to call back 
 not only would the factory reset not solve my problem it was obvious that she knew a factory reset would get me off of the phone 
 a bit over month or so ago we set up a virtualized <unk> for a customer where they connected over remote desktop services if they needed to interact with the server software running there 
 everything had ran smoothly ever since the initial setup but today i received a call from the customer 
 the customer was really frustrated as they needed something done fast and the ms own mac client just gave errors about trust issues to the server 
 not fluent with mac i still decided to poke around with teamviewer and soon discovered that my colleague who had set up that specific mac had installed microsoft remote desktop from the app store and left a note for the customer to use that instead of the remote desktop connection which also was on that computer 
 turns out the customer had been on a 2 week vacation and had forgotten about it 
 i demonstrated how to use the correct software over teamviewer and was preparing for the usual closing complaints about lost work time lost money difficult it stuff and so forth 
 then it happened 
 like a unicorn with <unk> <unk> spots : & gt client : i 'm so sorry for wasting your time 
 i now remember reading the note and using the correct software but i just had forgotten all about it during my vacation '' & gt me : long pause not believing what i hear & gt client : hello '' 
 & gt me : uh ... <unk> absolutely no problem '' & gt client : oh and just bill me for the time thank you '' & gt me : okay thanks and bye '' i remember my mother reading me about people <unk> when i was a kid but honestly this must 've been the first time i 've actually heard it 
 i tip my hat to the customer 
 you were <unk> <unk> mother has for a long time been wanting some sort of streaming device for her house 
 however her home internet kind of ... <unk> so i 'd <unk> her for a while 
 she 's periodically called her isp and had them troubleshoot and has been told that the highest speed she can get in her area a fairly popular <unk> of the largest city in our state is <unk> 
 they seemed to get things sorted out a bit better and last time i was there i ran some <unk> to show she was actually getting about <unk> down so i mentioned that maybe she could stream video after all 
 she went to get a <unk> but could n't get it set up on wireless downstairs - she said something about the connection not being strong enough 
 and really the connection in that room does suck 
 so she went to buy a wireless <unk> for that room and got it set up by herself 
 then she bought an <unk> and got that set up by herself too 
 *seriously - she did n't even call me to find out the ssid and <unk> key 
 that information is written on a <unk> on her fridge and she must have remembered where it was 
 * she 's discovered youtube and is planning to set up a netflix account 
 you go mom caller : yeah i 've got a new iphone 6 and it 's always really hot to the touch 
 also the battery wo n't hold a charge 
 i do n't even use it much throughout the day but it 's always dead by about <unk> me : ok can you go into the battery usage section and tell me what 's using up most of your battery 
 caller : it says home & amp lock screen has used 55 % of my battery over the last 7 days 
 me : uh ok. that 's really weird 
 do you have any unusual screen <unk> or anything like that 
 caller : no it 's brand new 
 i have only changed a couple of the settings on it 
 me : like what settings 
 caller : oh i enabled a security pin and made it so the screen is always on 
 me : the screen is always on 
 caller : yeah the screen kept automatically shutting off after 5 minutes so i went in and told it to never shut off 
 i like to set my phone up on my desk and use it like a clock 
 me : & lt sigh & gt ... .this story was previously killed by the <unk> 
 i am guessing it was because i was ranting 
 so no ranting 
 just a story of a user poking holes in personal email security 
 ***** i have completed some online training for <unk> administration 
 this was nice as i have been doing it for months <unk> on <unk> 
 for this hr requests the training 
 our hr helper <unk> a list of people to do the training then registers them online 
 i am told to go see her to provide some details 
 less than a minute into the conversation : & gt **hrh : ** “and your email address ” & gt **me : ** “fb @ <unk> & gt **hrh : ** “no your personal email <unk> & gt **me : ** * er ok * “fb @ <unk> & gt **hrh : ** <unk> password ” & gt **me : ** “what password ” & gt **hrh : ** “the password for your personal email <unk> & gt **me : ** * wut

 you just need an initial password 
 just type password123 
 that will work i <unk> later i get a nice automated email on my personal mobile : welcome # <unk> # blah blah etc your username is : fb @ <unk> your password is : password123 you will be asked to change your password when you first log into our system 
 i type a polite email to <unk> manager explaining <unk> misunderstanding and requested that the spreadsheet be <unk>

 ” * pocket of brain cells sacrifice themselves to protect those that are left * ***** **edit : ** my first tfts quote of the day 
 thank you all 
 started working at a computer repair shop there will probably be more stories to come but here 's my first interaction with a crazy lady cl 
 i do phone repairs at my work and some lady brought in a phone with a cracked screen 
 it was n't really too big of a crack just a scratch across the middle but whatever it 's her money 
 she comes in with her son probably around 10 and gives me the phone 
 here 's how the conversation went 
 cl : can you fix my phone 
 me : sure lem me take a look *i run a quick diagnostic call the store test the speakers etc 
 notice her home button does n't work very <unk> me : okay it looks like everything is working fine but i noticed your home button was acting weird 
 were you aware of this 
 cl : yes it does that me : okay just wanted to make sure 
 sign here and i 'll get you checked in 
 the repair will take about a half hour 
 after she signs i get started 
 the screens we have come only with the lcd <unk> and glass so i have to transfer the speaker camera home button and <unk> cables over 
 about a half hour later she comes back 
 me : hello i have your phone right here 
 i got the screen replaced and it works just fine now 
 cl : <unk> it out* my home button does n't work did you break it 
 me : no it was like that before the repair remember we discussed that 
 cl : no you broke it 
 me : ma'am we went over this after i tested the phone out 
 we do do home button replacements but we do n't have the parts in stock right now 
 do you want an estimate 
 cl : no you broke my fucking phone 
 i spend 100 fucking dollars and this is what i get 
 im gon na sue you and take everything you have in this store 
 me : see right here on this paper you signed where i noted the home button problems under prior issues '' 
 you knew before it was broken do n't try to pin this on us 
 if you want i can get you an estimate for a new button or you can speak to my manager but he wo n't be back until tomorrow 
 cl : well im not paying for it then 
 me : okay okay i 'll take a look at it again *cl hands it to me looking smug 
 i put it in display case behind counter and lock it 
 * me : you can either pay for the screen or i can take it off and give you your old one back 
 a business does a service and in return they get payment that 's how it works 
 *cl considers her options then finally <unk> fine take it off '' i spend another half hour putting the old screen back on and call her back 
 cl : about time you finished you should know i 'm giving you guys a bad review online 
 me : <unk> you do that 
 as she walks out i muster up the biggest grin i can manage and say have an absolutely wonderful day miss '' 
 she gives one last scowl and leaves 
 **edit : ** woah gilded in 5 minutes 
 thanks whoever did that so this tale starts with an irate customer and ends with confusion which i guess could be said of most tech issues 
 so to go back a pissed off client of ours calls and explains he is having trouble with an area of our website that he is accessing via his imac 
 ok. we go through all the usual fixes and still the client is unable to access it 
 he gets more pissed off 
 we have a test machine in the office and we try to recreate the issue but can not 
 which <unk> him even more so we ask him to send us a screenshot so we can see it and verify 1 this guy is actually following our instructions 2 he is actually having the issue as he describes 
 at this point both the client and us are pissed at the situation and the client reluctantly agrees to send us a screenshot 
 me : sir since we ca n't recreate the issue on our end i 'm going to ask you to send us a screenshot of the screen which you 're having problems with 
 can you do that for us '' 
 client '' *sigh* yes fine 
 i 'll send you a screenshot '' me : do you need me to walk you through the process '' 
 client : hardly ... '' so we wait for the screenshot and it does n't show up 
 a couple of days later i receive a piece of mail which i open and after a minute of confusion break into laughter the client 's screenshot '' that he sent consisted of a <unk> representation of what he was seeing on his screen 
 he even <unk> in the desktop icons i typed this before remembering i had the <unk> sorry about the confusion and wrote me a message outlining the situation 
 he had used a <unk> to draw the <unk> of the screen ... <unk> to say i had to call him back to walk him through the process but goddamn it i 've never laughed so hard in my life 
 not to mention the fact that he had to pay for a stamp to mail it to us ... <unk> adding screenshot *edit2* holy smoke front page 
 that 's pretty cool 
 *edit3* gold 
 thank you & gt me : sorry for your wait sir 
 my name is <unk> name <unk> how can i help you 
 & gt caller : i think there 's something wrong with my computer 
 & gt me : can you describe what it 's doing 
 & gt caller : it works just fine for awhile and then the screen turns blue 
 & gt me : is your monitor failing 
 & gt caller : no the computer 's broke 
 & gt me : okay what happens after the screen turns blue 
 & gt caller : some letters flash and it restarts 
 & gt me : does it say an error has occurred and windows has been shut down '' 
 & gt caller : yeah do you know what that is 
 & gt me : it 's called a blue screen of death in <unk> terms 
 there 's not -- & gt caller yelling : <unk> 
 & gt me : sir 
 & gt caller : my damn daughter and her fancy degree 
 she told me that 's what the problem was because college smarts and i bet her she was wrong 
 something 's wrong with the world when a kid knows more than her parents 
 & gt me : <unk> silence* & gt caller : can i charge you for this 
 & gt me : for what 
 & gt caller : for making me owe her 10 bucks 
 & gt me : ... .um no 
 & gt <unk> proceeds to hang up mumbling more about kids these days 
 * tl dr : dude bet his daughter that his computer was n't <unk> because he thinks something 's wrong with kids having college degrees and then asked if he could charge my company the 10 bucks he now owes her for her being <unk> was brewing at the restaurant 
 & amp nbsp this actually was n't much of a surprise 
 trouble was always brewing at the restaurant as a result of the regular operating procedure 
 procedure which i once again point out usually revolved around the owner refusing to spend a penny on anything regardless of how necessary it was 
 therefore we also had a couple of instances of promising <unk> trouble 
 ticking time <unk> 
 you know the drill 
 one of these was our new touch screen point of sale system 
 this was a very complicated all singing and all dancing hardware/software solution from a fairly large and well known vendor 
 which i 'd spent an entire panicked sunday re setting up from scratch after the owner freaked out on the vendor over cost fired them before they finished the setup and then buggered off on vacation to greece without telling anyone ... after <unk> our old point of sale system 
 here 's a refresher 
 did i mention the old point of sale system had to be replaced because she 'd done exactly the same thing to its vendor and they refused to support us anymore 
 because i feel like that pattern is an important thing to remember 
 & gt '' they 're just after my money '' 
 she often <unk> to no one in particular 
 installation contracts service contracts updates 
 it 's all a scam '' 
 very little the owner ever said did n't come with an exclamation point at the end of it 
 & amp nbsp speaking of getting ripped off the key <unk> behind replacing our old system was her <unk> belief that money and ingredients were being stolen from the restaurant 
 the new register system had very <unk> inventory ingredient and employee tracking features that she was convinced perhaps by enthusiastic <unk> that the supposed <unk> could be solved via software 
 i pointed out more than once that the constant <unk> in the books probably had more to do with the secretive and <unk> creative <unk> '' she used to systematically rip off her employees of owed tips and wages plus <unk> attempts to con her vendors 
 plus the fact that her maintenance man -- who had a long and <unk> history of <unk> drug abuse theft paranoia and general <unk> -- also had keys to the building *and* the safe and was the only other person aside from her who ever had <unk> access to the restaurant 
 i did n't need a pipe and a <unk> glass to figure out where any stolen money was going at any rate 
 the long and short of it was that *everything* was recorded in the system 's audit log 
 we 're talking <unk> levels of detail 
 every individual pizza topping added and removed to every order was tracked 
 which employee login was being used on which register 
 what the <unk> amount the <unk> entered was and how much change they were supposed to give 
 the length of delay between completing one order and entering another 
 how much time the operator spent on the credit card screen 
 i 'm surprised she did n't want us to serial number the damn pepperoni 
 chief among the owner 's ridiculous ideas about cash register security was that practically nothing should be able to be done on a register without requiring a manager override 
 this extended from logical things like the ability to enter <unk> to <unk> things like the ability of most employees to clock in and out 
 need to remove a dish from an order before submitting it to the kitchen because a customer changed their mind 
 manager override 
 need to add to an order already placed 
 manager override 
 want to view your own logged hours 
 manager override 
 etc. etc 
 & amp nbsp there were only two users who had manager permissions : the owner and me 
 and as soon as she figured out how to do it she revoked my access 
 this caused a fair few problems because everyone in the restaurant was using my override to you know get actual work done 
 anytime anyone needed to do *anything* they needed either me or the owner 
 so guess whose initials were all over the audit logs 
 yours truly 
 i caught a lot of static because of this 
 the owner loved her audit logs 
 she barely knew how to do anything else in the system except set up and change user accounts e.g 
 hiring and firing people and looking at the logs 
 and printing out the logs and waving them in people 's faces while getting angry over <unk> <unk> 
 another feature of this system the owner loved were the rfid keys 
 every terminal had a little usb thingy on it with a pair of sockets into which you could plug rfid keyfobs 
 you could use these in lieu of override passwords or any employee login and as long as you had one plugged in any override prompt would be skipped using the credentials of the account associated with the most <unk> key plugged in at the time 
 the side effect of this that the owner loved the most was that it prevented people from figuring out her password since she never had to enter it 
 the main weak link in this plan was the fact that the owner was only around about two days a week tops 
 when she left she took her key with her 
 why would she leave it lying around 
 anyone could do anything with it after all 
 the other weak link in this plan was that she could never remember her password because she rarely had to enter it 
 she also changed it frequently because unsurprisingly her current password got passed around the kitchen with lightning speed whenever anyone figured out what it was 
 i 'll bet a lot of you have already figured out how this story ends 
 we were engaged in a battle of <unk> 
 the restaurant staff just wanted to be able to clock in and out when the owner was n't around and were complaining to me since i 'd worked magic by setting the system up in the first place when no one could do anything 
 the owner 's <unk> paranoia led to her locking everyone out of everything and she could n't be made to see how this made doing business very difficult 
 then the inevitable happened 
 & amp nbsp & gt '' my password does n't work '' 
 the owner bellowed at me one day 
 & gt '' where 's your key '' 
 i asked from the kitchen 
 i was trying not to roll my eyes 
 i really was 
 & gt '' i ca n't find it 
 i think someone stole it '' the owner said 
 & gt '' i find that highly unlikely '' i replied 
 & gt '' fix it '' 
 she ordered 
 & gt '' ca n't '' i said sounding more than a little smug 
 & gt '' what do you mean you ca n't '' 
 & gt '' i used to be an administrator just like you 
 but you changed my account 
 now i ca n't change anything 
 i ca n't even clock in without your key remember '' 
 & gt '' that is because everyone was using your account for everything '' 
 & gt '' and that '' i said was because you locked everyone <unk> out of everything '' 
 & gt '' they are stealing from me 
 <unk> orders 
 changing money 
 i ca n't let them do anything in the system '' 
 & gt '' and if you 'd left people able to do their own work on their own account you 'd be able to tell who was doing this <unk> instead of seeing my initials all the time '' i concluded for her 
 gears were turning very slowly in her head 
 & gt '' what do we do now '' 
 she said 
 & gt '' call the vendor '' i suggested and shrugged 
 damned if i was letting this become my problem again 
 ultimately the owner called the vendor and after they were done <unk> at her they changed some <unk> <unk> support fee reset her password and mailed her a new keyfob 
 besides her <unk> about it for ages the main implication of this was that payroll was inexplicably delayed '' because she claimed she was locked out of the system for too long 
 in reality i think it was less than 12 hours 
 the other <unk> of this was that i overheard the owner 's new password 
 this was rapidly getting out of hand 
 for the next month and a half or so the restaurant ran like clockwork 
 the owner had fished her wish and after changing her password yet again no one was using it to do <unk> things like clock in and out or add pizzas to orders 
 she <unk> down on user permissions even harder 
 for about a day at one point you even needed an override to enter in a new order 
 but employees were <unk> in and out <unk> even when the owner was n't there 
 orders were getting written served assigned and delivered 
 modifications were being made to tickets on demand and the owner 's audit log was filling up with pages and pages of flawlessly executed orders with ingredients moving in and food moving out in perfect <unk> 
 meanwhile my paychecks -- and only <unk> paychecks -- were getting increasingly past due 
 everyone had their pay delayed by about two weeks following the password disaster but mine was going on two months and still missing 
 i started job hunting in <unk> while living off only my tips 
 i can only assume that this was a combination of <unk> for not being able to magically solve the owner 's password issue and thus costing her an expensive service call plus the <unk> suspicion that the reason everyone was having such a peachy time with the computer system was somehow my doing 
 well 
 & amp nbsp & gt '' again with this password '' 
 the owner shrieked 
 she 'd made a rare appearance at the restaurant one night 
 her office had a little window that overlooked the kitchen so everyone could hear her yelling 
 sometimes it was at employees 
 usually these days it was at the computer 
 & gt '' get in here '' 
 she ordered me 
 & gt '' have you finally found my paychecks '' 
 i asked <unk> 
 & gt '' i do n't know what you 're talking about '' 
 she said <unk> 
 & gt '' sure '' i said 
 & gt '' this thing 
 does 
 not 
 work '' 
 she screamed 
 & gt '' that 's your old key '' i pointed out 
 the one that was stolen '' all those weeks ago 
 & gt '' no it is n't '' 
 she insisted 
 & gt '' yes it is '' i said 
 it 's green 
 the new one is blue 
 but just put in your password '' 
 & gt '' that does n't work either '' 
 she complained 
 & gt '' you forgot it again '' 
 & gt '' no 
 i did n't forget 
 it wo n't work '' 
 & gt '' call the vendor then '' i suggested and started to walk away 
 & gt '' absolutely not 
 that cost me two hundred dollars last time '' 
 & gt '' well '' i said <unk> i have no idea what you expect me to do about it 
 tech support is above my pay grade 
 i set your system up once for free before you locked me out and i 'm not touching it again without pay 
 and considering you have n't paid me my normal hours in two months i 'm not pressing a single button until you settle up for both '' 
 she glared at me in silence for a while 
 & gt '' order up '' 
 came the call from the kitchen 
 i shrugged and walked away 
 the next day the owner presented me with a <unk> of cash <unk> about $ 150 
 & gt '' here '' she said 
 your damn money 
 ridiculous holding me for ransom 
 everyone has their hands in my pockets i see 
 so fix it '' 
 i carefully <unk> up the bills before putting them away 
 & gt '' all right '' i said 
 but i never promised i could do anything about it 
 bring it up '' 
 she bought up the change users '' screen on one of the cash registers and tried to open her own account 
 the usual manager override prompt popped up 
 & gt '' let 's try this '' i said 
 carefully deliberately i entered a password 
 6 
 6 
 6. the prompt went away 
 next to me the owner was rapidly turning crimson and then purple 
 i quietly <unk> out of the room before she exploded 
 & gt ** '' what 
 ** she shrieked 
 the dining room went silent 
 stunned <unk> dropped their <unk> 
 what was <unk> 
 ** '' & gt '' number of the beast '' i said <unk> sticking my head <unk> the door from the kitchen 
 & gt '' whose password is that '' 
 she demanded 
 & gt '' dunno '' i said 
 presumably the beast himself '' 
 & gt '' ridiculous '' she spat 
 how did you do that '' 
 & gt '' do what '' 
 i said innocently 
 she stormed off to her office for the rest of the night 
 i did n't see her again until closing time 
 & amp nbsp she cornered be just before i walked out the door 
 & gt '' i want you to take that thing off my <unk> '' she demanded 
 & gt '' and i need you to pay me my back wages '' i responded casually 
 she did not respond 
 so i went home 
 & amp nbsp the next morning when i walked in the door i was immediately approached by bob our previously mentioned <unk> unreliable maintenance man 
 he handed me another <unk> of cash that was roughly equivalent to the amount of my outstanding paychecks 
 needless to say the owner was not evident 
 & gt '' she wants you to fix the computer thingy '' he said 
 & gt '' and where is she '' 
 i asked 
 bob just shrugged 
 i tried the owner 's cell phone and she picked up before the first ring was finished 
 & gt '' you got your stupid money yes '' 
 she asked accusingly 
 & gt '' yeah it looks like it 's all here '' i said 
 & gt '' are you happy now 
 now i want that beast thing off my computers '' 
 she barked 
 & gt '' you do realize it 's the sole reason your business has been <unk> for the last two months right '' 
 & gt '' i do n't care '' 
 she barked 
 delete it '' 
 & gt '' i think i 'll pass '' i said 
 as a matter of fact as of thirty seconds ago i quit 
 you have your password back i 'll let you take care of it '' 
 i had to hold the phone away from my ear with the <unk> of cursing that came down the line after this 
 & gt '' you are not allowed to quit '' 
 she finally finished 
 & gt '' i 'm not sure you 're understanding how <unk> employment works '' i said 
 i was quit when i came in here and i 'm twice as quit now '' 
 surely the reference was lost 
 more <unk> followed so i put her on speaker 
 & gt '' ... and you are huge <unk> and i hope you rot in hell 
 you owe me 
 you ca n't quit 
 i <unk> you '' 
 i leaned against the soda machine while this was going on pretending not to pay attention 
 all work had stopped at the counter 
 customers were staring 
 & gt '' uh who 's that '' 
 one of the customers asked 
 & gt '' the owner '' i said 
 & gt '' oh '' he said 
 and then walked out without ordering 
 & amp nbsp i would like to say that i followed that customer out the door to <unk> applause from the kitchen and <unk> 
 company shirt thrown one way rfid keyfob the other out the front door with both middle fingers in the air as the music <unk> and the camera <unk> out 
 roll credits 
 but of course it does n't happen that way 
 instead i handed bob a shopping bag full of all my company shirts and my rfid key before quietly leaving out the back door 
 he caught up with me in the parking lot as i was adjusting my tie 
 cigarette hanging out of his mouth as usual 
 & gt '' where the hell are you off to '' 
 he asked 
 & gt '' work '' i said 
 & gt '' did ... did you plan all this '' 
 & gt '' i *always* have a plan '' i told him 
 that was the last day i ever set foot in that place 
 & amp nbsp i still have some friends who work there 
 every once in a while i ask how things are going at the restaurant 
 to this day the beast still <unk> the computer system 
 the owner has never deleted him even though technically she could 
 every time someone needs to clock in write an order or add extra pepperoni to a pizza god <unk> the beast is there watching over them 
 making the audit logs look pretty and turning the gears of business 
 protecting everyone from the owner 
 bringing up <unk> that have been tampered with when the labor board comes knocking 
 and in an extraordinarily <unk> way ensuring that the system is working as it was originally intended 
 everyone is happy 
 well <unk> <unk> you lovely people 
 standard disclaimer for all of my stories : i am not it 
 i know how to use google and i enjoy pc gaming 
 this is sufficient for me to become the default it '' guy for friends family and occasionally colleagues 
 one thing i do n't do anymore for any cost is support friends of friends or friends of family 
 or friends of colleagues 
 you get the idea 
 i used to support anyone and everyone who would ask for me and was willing to pay my price <unk> and reasonable fee or a steak dinner 
 this is a tale of why i stopped that 
 also the no '' s in this story are not an <unk> it went down on the client 's end exactly as <unk> 
 back story : friend of a friend runs a small dry cleaning business 
 she had been doing her books entirely on her home pc in excel 
 for whatever reason she wanted to start doing her books at her place of work and thus she needed a business computer '' 
 enter : me <unk> <unk> after listening to her list of needs i pointed her to a very nice rudimentary hp at best buy that was well within her budget and did everything she needed it to do run ms excel 
 and it even came with a copy of microsoft office not the trial version i made sure of that so it really was ideal for her use 
 i set everything up for her and transferred files over from her home pc to her new work pc 
 by which i mean i moved one 32 kb <unk> file via usb 
 the usb is important 
 see she never once mentioned needing internet connection for her work pc and i never asked 
 i figured it 'd be <unk> that way anyways 
 a week later i get a call : & gt owner : hi i ca n't check my emails '' 
 & gt me : oh odd there might be a brief internet outage in your area you might want to wait 30 minutes or so 
 if it persists give your isp a call '' 
 thirty minutes later & gt owner : it 's been thirty minutes my internet still is down so i called comcast 
 they 're saying they ca n't find my account information anywhere '' 
 & gt me : odd you did n't change providers did you '' 
 & gt owner : no 
 nothing 's changed since you set everything up '' 
 aside : i also set up her home pc about a year prior with comcast internet and so i assumed this was all regarding her home pc 
 also it 's worth noting that her home was 5 minutes away from my home while her business was a good 40 minute drive & gt me : ok it 'll take me 5 minutes to get there i 'll swing by '' 
 & gt owner : happily oh are you in the area 
 good '' 
 & gt me : ... yeah i 'm at home '' 
 & gt owner : i 'm at work '' 
 & gt me : realizing the miscommunication ohhhh i never set your business computer up with internet because you never mentioned it 
 if you want internet you 'll have to contact comcast directly '' 
 & gt owner : no '' 
 tone had grown very <unk> & gt me : ok. i can call them and set it up for you 
 standard rates apply since i 'll be the middle man here '' 
 & gt owner : no '' 
 & gt me : huh 
 '' sorry i did n't get that 
 what are you saying no to '' 
 & gt owner : i 'm not paying you again 
 i paid you once to set up my this computer and you did n't finish the job '' 
 & gt me : you paid me to set up your computer 
 i did exactly that 
 you never mentioned needing or wanting internet '' 
 & gt owner : no '' 
 & gt me : ... no to what '' 
 & gt owner : no '' 
 & gt me : ... <unk> so i 'm going to go now '' 
 & gt owner : no '' 
 & gt me : good bye '' 
 hangs up 10 minutes later & gt owner : calls back '' i need internet '' 
 & gt me : ... yeah i heard you you need to call comcast '' 
 & gt owner : no '' 
 & gt me : ok i 'll call comcast for you '' 
 & gt owner : good '' 
 & gt me : after you pay me my fee '' 
 & gt owner : no '' 
 & gt me : no '' 
 & gt owner : no '' 
 & gt me : no '' 
 & gt owner : no '' 
 & gt me : maybe '' 
 by this point i had stopped being angry and i was wildly confused and more than a little amused 
 & gt owner : no '' 
 & gt me : bye '' 
 & gt owner : no '' 
 i hung up on her 
 30 minutes later i kid you not ... & gt owner : no '' 
 & gt me : seriously '' 
 & gt owner : yes '' 
 & gt me : yes '' 
 & gt owner : no '' 
 eventually i tired of this and just blocked her number 
 never spoke with her after that incident though our mutual friend later told me that when she becomes extremely angry she often just repeats no '' like a robot stuck in a loop 
 so it was n't just me then 
 tl dr : owner uses <unk> mode 
 it 's not very effective ... thanks to <unk> for the suggestion hi /r/talesfromtechsupport 
 i started helping with tech support at my job last week and immediately realized why the company helpdesk is doing everything to be as <unk> as possible 
 i got a call from a lady at our marketing department saying she had a problem with a browser 
 & gt **me** what 's the problem 
 & gt **marketing lady** i need you to come down here to help & gt **me** ca n't you just tell me what 's wrong 
 & gt **marketing lady** no i need you to come i sigh put down the phone and make my way over there 
 to my horror there it is on her screen - a shiny internet explorer window full of <unk> toolbars 
 & gt **me** so what 's wrong 
 & gt **marketing lady** i have ads constantly popping up everywhere despite the fact that i have <unk> on & gt **me** * internally : there 's <unk> for ie 
 * do n't you have firefox installed 
 it 's supposed to be on every computer at this company 
 & gt **marketing lady** yeah but i like internet explorer more 
 & gt **me** <unk> okay it might be some kinda adware - have you checked your computer for viruses 
 & gt **marketing lady** no i ca n't 
 & gt *i get the feeling that i do n't want to know the answer to my next question 
 * & gt **me** why 
 & gt **marketing lady** i do n't have any antivirus software installed 
 & gt **me** what 
 we have a <unk> licence for <unk> software* who set up your computer 
 & gt **marketing lady** no no it was installed when i got the computer but the notifications were annoying me when i tried to install things 
 dear full-time tech support workers i <unk> you for your patience 
 it truly is <unk> <unk> tfts 
 so here 's the deal i work for a parking company and their pc 's were quite dated i 'm talking made for windows xp dell optiplex pos not point of sale systems 
 well they did n't have extended service through microsoft and their antivirus eventually ran out 
 <unk> does n't support xp anymore and the it guy said it would be fine since their behind a firewall 
 exact 
 words 
 <unk> a virus infected one of the desktops 
 stored itself on the shared drive infected the crappy server they had and infected the other two desktops on the network 
 it dude freaks out starts raging on my bosses and locks down the network after replacing all 3 desktops and <unk> the drive 
 that was a bit overkill but <unk> i 'm just an <unk> 
 the new desktops from <unk> come in dude locks down the network so there 's no internet access 
 this is crappy since our time clock <unk> every night to a different system in a different part of the city and we need access to the internet for our event calendar 
 so my boss asked dude to come fix it 
 he did the whole <unk> order thing and convinced our upper management that they needed to buy extra stuff 
 my boss stepped in and said f-that 
 friday night after work i spent an <unk> configuring their desktops updating the server and adding the proper addresses in the firewall to let things communicate with the outside world 
 it guy was pissed and threatened to cancel his contract his boss bitched him out and gave them a discount and replaced him with a new guy who appreciated what i did 
 they even offered me a job 
 anyways today i come to work and go into the office to clock in 
 a fallout <unk> collection is sitting on my bosses desk i ask who 's is that '' 
 my boss has this cheesy <unk> upper management asked what would be a nice gift and told me to go buy you something 
 they wanted to give you a bottle of jack but i figured this would be cooler for you '' 
 i also got a free day of work on my paycheck 
 edit : pic of the <unk> collection customer : you guys were the last ones to touch my computer and now it 's not working 
 me : ok let me check our tickets to see what was done 
 ok the last visit we made to your office was 18 months ago 
 customer : that seems correct 
 you guys were here and then it stopped working 
 me : so this computer has been sitting unused for a year and half 
 customer : no i use it every day 
 me : but you said we were the last people to touch it 
 customer : your guy was the last one to touch it who knew what he was doing 
 i do n't know what i 'm doing so i really do n't count that 
 *this story takes place during the period known as last week '' in the frozen <unk> of a land known as canada 
 the hero of our story had been battling a herd of wild <unk> for days and now found himself on the losing side 
 * my daylight alarm clock <unk> me with <unk> sunlight as it often does 
 i rolled over and muttered a curse at it however the only sound that came from my mouth was white noise 
 crap i 'd completely lost my voice 
 i was also sick as a dog coated in <unk> 
 definitely one to call in.. well text 
 no problem '' my boss replied take all the time you need '' 
 yay 
 exactly 23 minutes later i had another message 
 i know you 're sick but we need you to come in 
 now '' 
 thanks boss 
 but i was curious about what precipitated this request so i said i 'd stop by 
 by the time i showed up the workday had been going for about an hour or should have been half the office was at a <unk> 
 my boss pulled me to one side and handed me a list 
 everything 's broken '' 
 she said 
 i tried to <unk> out a question but i could n't even manage a whisper 
 instead i had to resort to <unk> with my majestic eyebrows 
 <unk> 
 * i gestured 
 yes everything '' 
 she replied without missing a beat 
 start with the printer '' 
 now you might think being that sick at work with that much crap hitting the fan is a bad thing -- i certainly did -- but it 's actually <unk> 
 <unk> one* wants to bother you when you look like something scraped off the <unk> of a boat 
 i checked the first item on the list 
 printer ca n't print anymore '' 
 <unk> right let 's have a look 
 * as i entered the room people <unk> like oil from dish soap 
 i looked at the printer and <unk> out a laugh among other things 
 someone had accidentally paused it as evidenced by the blinking pause '' <unk> 
 next on the list 
 computer ca n't print anymore '' 
 thankfully pushing resume solved this issue too 
 server wo n't restart '' 
 i thought this would have been at the top of the list but whatever i did n't write it 
 turns out the ups died an <unk> death that very morning 
 and on it went for about two <unk> hours 
 somehow nearly every electronic device in the office managed to get sick along with me 
 my boss came to the same conclusion so i think it was only half a joke that i 'm not allowed to leave anymore 
 tl dr : beware the <unk> so the previous tale happened a few weeks ago and after the awesome response i got from you guys i called up $ friend to get an update 
 the investigation ended a few days after the charge was reversed and the investigation found that there was no wrong-doing in the part of the company but their lawyers suggested a change in their terms of service 
 the lady later called back crying because she took out a bank loan to pay for the server and had no way to pay it back without the profit of the pottery company which is why she had to reverse the charge 
 the call was being recorded and she <unk> all that so the recording was given to the police and the fraud charges were dropped 
 my friend asked her why she got such a big server and apparently she thought that <unk> of ram meant that 1 person could access the website at once so she wanted 250 to be able to get onto it at once 
 in the end no real harm was done to the company beyond legal fees which were paid by the woman since she <unk> declared fraud and the initial deployment cost of the server 
 she was obviously placed on the <unk> list of the <unk> want to say i just found this sub and love it 
 i created a google sheet for our head of principals so that he could track the ordering of it equipment and share it with our in school techs 
 i wrote a small script that sends any info to another sheet so the techs only see what they need to and to sort by column 3 1 2 in that order 
 it works well and i am happy with it 
 he shares this document with his secretary who works in our it department 
 i came in one morning and 7 people were around her desk because she is saying nothing has worked for 30 minutes 
 no matter what she types it does n't appear 
 7 it people 1 google sheet 
 i walk over and look she has grey cells and guess what 
 she had grey font 
 7 it people couldnt see the font colour 
 ah edit : my first post made it to front page ... im <unk> out and want to say thanks to all of you 
 i look forward to enjoying many a tales from the <unk> 's story reminded me of my own experience with please hurry '' 
 i do n't work in tech support ready your <unk> i 'm a developer 
 i 've had plenty of roles that have involved doing stuff outside by job due to a combination of <unk> company and 'all computer work is the same 
 anyway i was working for a small web dev company that sold software to the public sector 
 it was all about public engagement so we had some enthusiastic clients who really wanted to use it and others that did n't really care as long as they were <unk> to care 
 this particular month we 'd been adding a few features for our first client in a new country even though it seemed to be one of the box-ticking clients it was a good excuse to get the features ready for the serious users 
 it got to the day before launch and i was told to put the site live on the internet 
 i asked for the hosting details and was told that the only decision made was to use <unk> 
 so i start putting together the machines we 'll need and i ask about budget 
 none 
 there was literally no hosting budget at all so convinced this client was about the fact it was a box-ticking exercise 
 i asked if we could ask the client for something in writing about how little traffic they were expecting and got back maybe two or three sessions a day 
 we 're only <unk> it in one place '' 
 so fine it 's their money i put it on a small instance and go home 
 true i had the next day off but what could the harm be 
 it 's only going to be mentioned in one place they 're expecting a dozen or so sessions all day if it 's slow we 'll <unk> it a bit and we 'll have data to show to the client that it 's needed 
 the next day i 'm at home watching tv having not long woken up and i get a call 
 get in here now 
 fires '' 
 sure i say i 'll hop in the shower and head over to the office i 'll be there in an hour 
 not soon enough 
 skip the shower we do n't mind we 've sent a taxi 
 get in now '' 
 fine 
 i get in the taxi to go half a mile to the office 
 the first thing i see when i get in is three people starting <unk> instances as quickly as they could 
 the hosting budget had been increased by this point to be effectively unlimited 
 you see it turns out that the client 's session estimate was a little off 
 they were right it was only announced in one place however that one place was a speech 
 made by the country 's head of state 
 on television 
 and covered in the morning news on all channels 
 it all worked out in the end but it involved working until 4am <unk> all the performance fixes we could think of until the site was stable enough to turn off the additional instances added during the day 
 you 've never configured <unk> until you 've done so with representatives of the executive wing of a foreign government shouting we 've got a patient who 's bleeding 
 what are you going to do to stop the bleeding '' 
 at <unk> tfts 
 never posted here but my dad told me quite a good story from his days in tech support and i could n't help but share it 
 so back in the 80 's my dad worked for a company that gave tech support to offices so they would n't have to hire a designated it guy 
 one day he got a call from a client who claimed she lost all of her work at lunch every day 
 my dad clearly did n't believe her so he went to the client 's office the next day and followed her daily routine 
 throughout the morning she did her work and saved it on a floppy disk all good 
 then came <unk> oh boy 
 my father said to the client <unk> it 's lunch what do you do '' 
 the client then took out the floppy disk and <unk> it to her filing cabinet using a magnet 
 ** it took him a while to explain to the client that magnets mess up floppy disks and any kind of computer hardware 
 edit : this is like 2 months later so not a lot of people will see this but thanks for all the likes 'n stuff 
 my dad was n't as excited as i was with an oh cool '' representing his amount of excitement for the support it got 
 but for me thanks for all the support and especially anyone who posted a comment got some good stories and laughs out of them 
 *i work for a company that is contracted to provide government support 
 we have many contractors but government employees <unk> us about <unk> as such they feel they can act and treat us any way they like 
 * i am sitting in the call center about 90 minutes prior to the end of my shift 
 i get a call from a particularly nasty customer & gt **rik : ** $ supportdepartment how can i help you 
 & gt ** $ customer : ** yeah your ticketing system is broke 
 & gt **rik : ** give me just a moment let me take a look at it 
 *i log in verify i can submit resolve <unk> and modify tickets 
 i check the srm <unk> and <unk> 
 nothing is <unk> 
 * & gt **rik : ** i ca n't see any issue on my end can you tell me the exact error you 're seeing 
 & gt ** $ customer : ** yeah it 's $ <unk> & gt **rik : ** ah i see 
 i just so happen to know how to fix that 
 can i remotely access your machine 
 *he agrees i do so 
 i modify some of the ticket details and do a <unk> on the ticket itself 
 i notice he is requesting three separate actions and he is trying to assign it directly to a technician which is against policy 
 * & gt **rik : ** sir this will have to be submitted as three tickets 
 & gt ** $ customer : ** why 
 i 've always done it like this 
 & gt **rik : ** you 're requesting work on three machines 
 that is three tickets 
 in addition you can not directly assign it to a technician 
 that 's done on our end 
 that 's the policy 
 & gt ** $ customer : ** well i 'm not changing how i do it 
 *i look over to my supervisor who happens to be in the room 
 i inform him of the situation 
 he tells me to enforce the policy which is to inform the customer that his actions are not <unk> and will be cancelled if he submits it 
 * & gt **rik : ** sir while you have the ability to assign the ticket to a technician that technician might not be available 
 just because he is the one that responds the majority of the time does not mean he will always be available 
 in order to provide you with quick and consistent service we assign the tickets to the technicians based on their workload and current <unk> 
 if this ticket is submitted and directly assigned it will be cancelled 
 also this must be submitted as three tickets or else it will be cancelled as well as an improper submission 
 *my supervisor is next to me and gives me a thumbs up 
 i finish the call disconnect from his machine and walk over to my supervisor 
 & gt **rik : ** well that was fun 
 & gt ** $ supervisor : ** let me know what happens 
 chances are he 's going to submit it anyways 
 *i check and sure enough that technician has a new ticket assigned 
 i cancel the ticket sending the customer an email cc 'd to $ supervisor $ shiftlead and $ departmentmanager 
 i get a call from him about five minutes after yelling at me for <unk> his ticket 
 i send him a copy of our policy which is n't new and tell him the specific paragraphs that were violated 
 he hangs up <unk> 
 i then see another ticket assigned to the same tech from the same person with the same exact request 
 this is cancelled and emails are sent again 
 this happens twice more that shift 
 the next morning i arrive at work and see that he waited for me to leave before doing it again 
 the technician has already begun working on this ticket so i can not cancel it 
 * *i open outlook and find an email from $ departmentmanager with $ supervisor and $ shiftlead cc 'd 
 the email is a meeting location and time 
 all four of us arrive at the meeting location when $ departmentmanager suggests going outside for the conversation 
 we go out to the smoking area where $ supervisor and $ departmentmanager start smoking 
 i start <unk> and $ shiftlead looks a bit <unk> as $ shiftlead is the only one that does not <unk> 
 i fill in all three of the saga between $ customer and myself 
 * & gt ** $ departmentmanager : ** well that explains why he filed a complaint against you 
 & gt <unk> $ supervisor : ** he did what 
 & gt ** $ departmentmanager : ** yep 
 said you were rude unprofessional and obscene 
 he also said you had a <unk> tone 
 & gt ** $ supervisor : ** that 's a load of bullshit right there 
 i was standing right next to him and told him what to say 
 he was lucky he did n't have to deal with me because i 'm tired of his shit 
 & gt ** $ departmentmanager : ** and that 's why we 're out here in an <unk> environment 
 instead of the conference room where i 'd write your ass up for that 
 *we all laugh a little because that week was so stressful we were all about to crack 
 finally it all gets sorted out 
 $ departmentmanager says he will contact $ customer 's supervisor regarding the issue 
 $ shiftlead leaves and goes back to work 
 the three of us still <unk> outside for a few more minutes 
 $ supervisor and i discuss ways to prevent the situation from happening in the future 
 i suggest revoking his ticketing credentials and have him use the srm as normal customers do 
 i go back to my desk and modify the $ customer 's account in our ticketing system to reflect the changes 
 ten minutes later i get another <unk> & gt **rik : ** $ supportdepartment how can i help you 
 & gt ** $ customer : ** yeah your ticketing system is broke 
 & gt **rik : ** what seems to be the issue 
 & gt ** $ customer : ** i ca n't submit tickets i can only request services 
 & gt **rik : ** we have recently revoked submission rights from everyone but department heads and technicians 
 if you submit a service request a ticket will be generated and routed appropriately 
 & gt ** $ customer : ** very infuriated who are you to tell me what i can and ca n't do 
 give me ticketing rights or i 'm going right to your boss 
 & gt **rik : ** ca n't do that sir 
 if you have a complaint i suggest contacting your department head or the $ <unk> 
 the customer hangs up and i do n't hear anything for another hour 
 out of the blue a knock lands on our door 
 our office is restricted to authorized personnel enforced by rfid access cards 
 only technicians have authorization to enter this room as well as most management 
 i answer the door with my foot braced against it 
 the customer attempts to push his way through me and fails 
 when that occurs he begins screaming 
 during his tirade a few people had stopped to watch 
 i still have not let him in the office 
 we then hear a voice that was quite loud and quite pissed off 
 & gt <unk> : ** what is going on here 
 *he turns and i poke my head out the door 
 not two feet away is a very tall very pissed high ranking official 
 his uniform instantly gave away who he was 
 $ customer stops mid-sentence and turns white 
 * & gt ** $ <unk> how about we continue this conversation somewhere more appropriate 
 my office 
 five minutes 
 bring your leadership i do n't care what they are doing 
 *i find $ supervisor and $ departmentmanager interrupt the meeting they are having and inform them of what occurred 
 both follow me to $ official 's office 
 in that office we find $ official $ <unk> $ customer $ <unk> and a few other people i do n't recognize 
 the conversation gets very brutal very quickly 
 $ official has to silence everybody and then he looks at me 
 * & gt ** $ official : ** <unk> what was that about 
 *i tell him and stumble over quite a few of my words i have really bad <unk> i take <unk> for and finally get the whole story out my body shaking 
 i feel <unk> and certain i 'm going to lose my job 
 $ official <unk> me and my leadership and we walk outside 
 we start <unk> and wait to see the result 
 fifteen minutes later $ official is standing outside the building holding it open while two security guards walk $ customer outside and to his car 
 they remove his id access cards and give him a box of all of his stuff from his desk 
 * ever since then most of the people that work here have begun treating us like people 
 apparently the government never knew how bad we were being treated but they put a stop to it after that 
 this was n't the first time something like this had happened but i have n't heard anything close to this happen since then 
 i did a lot of unpaid it work in high school and was fairly knowledgeable so when i got to college in 2005 <unk> to my university 's help desk seemed to be a logical choice 
 since it was my first professional '' interview i was really nervous about it 
 before now i had just worked retail and as a line <unk> at a local <unk> ... two jobs basically given to me with no real interview 
 when i arrived for my interview it was in one of the it conference rooms ... very professional very business like 
 the gentleman interviewing me wore a suit and had a stone cold <unk> face 
 sitting across from me after a quick <unk> of names he started the interview by saying i 'm a user my computer does n't work 
 fix it '' 
 he just sat there staring at me ... no computer in sight 
 i said well what exactly is it that you 're trying to do that wo n't work '' 
 use my computer 
 it wo n't work 
 fix it '' 
 he said still <unk> 
 what 's displayed on your monitor at the moment '' 
 i asked 
 i do n't know that that means 
 my computer is n't working and i ca n't check my email or grade student assignments 
 fix it '' 
 i just kind of stared for a moment ... kind of in shock at how the interview was going but realizing this was probably a fairly common user interaction 
 is ... is it plugged in '' 
 i asked no sure of what else to do with no actual computer in this <unk> and fairly high stress at this point interview 
 my <unk> looked at me grinned <unk> reached across the table to shake my hand and said you 're hired you 'll do well here '' and then got up and walked out 
 another person came in shortly after and asked me to fill out a <unk> 
 and that 's how i got my first real '' it <unk> boss runs the it department with ... what 's stronger than an iron fist 
 an <unk> bear hug 
 today i found out just how harsh he can be when crossed 
 phone call comes in 
 i take it it 's a relatively speaking small company calling us 
 me : this is <unk> how can i help you today '' 
 them : we lost some data 
 a surge protector failed and all the disks in an array got fried 
 we were using your hard disks model number redacted 
 we 'll need $ number new disks of that model number '' 
 me : sure we can ship you $ number new hard disks '' 
 i type in the order 
 them : do you do data recovery '' 
 boss <unk> in on the line 
 we do in fact do data recovery 
 the cost is $ cost '' 
 them : that 's too expensive 
 can you do it for $ lower cost '' 
 boss : no 
 the cost is $ cost 
 we will be glad to do it for that price and we will put it as a top priority if you ship us the damaged disks '' 
 them : we really ca n't afford that '' 
 boss : fine 
 we 'll be happy to ship you $ number new disks then '' 
 them : you are being totally unfair 
 we 're a small company we ca n't afford to pay $ cost for data recovery '' 
 boss : we have to charge $ cost to cover the time and expense required to recover the data '' 
 them : expletive you you <unk> expletive '' 
 boss : as of now we are terminating your business association with us 
 we will ship you the replacement disks 
 i wish you good luck in the future 
 goodbye 
 i was tech support for a nation wide hair <unk> company 
 hair <unk> are not the most tech savvy people 
 & gt stylist : hi tech support some random buttons were accidentally hit on the keyboard and it locked our door 
 & gt me : ... ..i 'm sorry can you explain that again 
 do you mean the computer is locked 
 like its on the <unk> screen 
 i was thinking the windows key + l was hit 
 & gt stylist : no a <unk> bottle was knocked off the shelf and it hit some buttons on the keyboard that made the door shut and lock 
 we just had it opened 
 after the bottle fell the door automatically closed and we heard a click sound like a lock 
 & gt me : well i can tell you right now no combination of keys on your computer is going to physically shut and lock a real door 
 do you have keys for the door 
 & gt stylist : we do n't have any keys and there is no <unk> anyways 
 wait one of the other stylist said she saw which part of the keyboard the bottle hit and she is going to try dropping the bottle on it again 
 & gt me : no do n't do that it 's not going to work ... ... too late she had put the phone down and i could heard the <unk> in the background 
 bam bam 
 no its still locked 
 try it again '' 
 & gt me : hello 
 do n't ... do n't do that 
 please stop that 
 bam bam bam bam & gt me : <unk> 
 i could still hear them in the background 
 bam hey it worked that time 
 it 's unlocked now '' 
 & gt stylist : ok we got it unlocked now it just took a few tries 
 & gt me : that worked 
 & gt stylist : yeah we 're good now thanks 
 turns out a mop had been placed on the inside corner of the closet and when the <unk> bottle fell it caused the mop to fall across the back of the door 
 shutting and holding it in place 
 dropping the bottle cause the mop to move again 
 a few years ago i took over a sysadmin job at a <unk> because my predecessor was sick and there was no estimate on when he 'll come back 
 he came back a year later and was fine the system was in a catastrophic state and i had to <unk> most of the servers over the summer and upgrade the 15 year old software that was running the school 
 this included deleting the old active directory domain and users and basically <unk> the whole school 
 a few weeks after school started again a senior came to me and said in a kind of angry voice : & gt excuse me when will my domain admin account work again 
 i ca n't log on to the new servers '' 
 i thought i <unk> him or he meant his local machine or something but he was serious 
 the old admin had <unk> no technical skills and just learned how to use some systems but he gave selected students <unk> admin <unk> so they can manage the system also the file servers with the teachers files on them for him and also once a year log onto every computer and install windows updates by hand yes once a year when i told the <unk> about the whole thing she was furious and when the original sysadmin came back he was n't put in it anymore and i still manage that <unk> few weeks ago one of my users was surprised by a loud noise '' at a job site and dropped a large container of coffee directly <unk> her laptop 's keyboard while the laptop was on 
 it 's been my experience that if *any* liquid is dropped near a laptop it <unk> finds its way into the laptop - it 's like a law of nature 
 it should be noted that i quite literally just deployed this laptop user had it no more than 3 weeks total 
 anyway i called the <unk> & amp discovered that our warranty does n't include <unk> - accidental damage protection - and i 'd have to send it back to them & amp get a quote for repair 
 i remembered reading this on tfts some months back and decided to try it out 
 i added three large bags of swedish fish to the laptop box <unk> $ 10 total & amp shipped it off for repair 
 i 've been expecting an email from the <unk> about it for a few weeks but received nothing until yesterday afternoon - the reason for service in the email was marked as ca n't power off '' even though i <unk> stated that it was a liquid damage '' issue ... they replaced the mobo & amp ram and updated the bios for basically free well three bags of candy 
 everyone in my group thought this was absolutely hilarious 
 honestly i 'm surprised that it worked 
 **tl dr** : candy makes you dandy 
 thanks for the gold friendly redditor 
 i work in it security and am rolling out <unk> compliance at a customers location 
 we 're in the <unk> phase where we bring on complex password requirements screen lock <unk> etc 
 i get a call to help a user out who was missed on the list of users at a location to get the new requirements 
 so of course i call to help him out : & gt me : hi user it appears you were missed on the rollout of the new security requirements i 've added you to the security groups 
 we need to change your password i 'm going to remote in and be there if you need me 
 sounds good 
 & gt user : yep come on in 
 i remote in 
 & gt me : great 
 now i 'm going to need you to log out and log back in so you can choose a new password 
 user logs out 
 & gt me : okay now enter you current password and you should be prompted to change it 
 & gt user : actually i do n't need to enter a password 
 i found a way to bypass the password by just clicking the circle with the arrow on it next to the password field 
 & gt me : oh really can you show me how you do this 
 & gt user : sure 
 user clicks the login button with no password and gets the password change prompt 
 i then realize the user has no password on his account 
 & gt user : see is n't that neat 
 good thing you guys are bringing in better security 
 & gt me : that 's what we are here for sir 
 now lets get you that new password ... so this just happened literally just happened 
 i walk into my neighborhood bar and they had just had a five minute power loss 
 it looks like everything came back up except for the pos terminal behind the bar 
 looking at the case from my <unk> it 's a <unk> 's dell desktop 
 i <unk> over to the <unk> friend of mine and ask in my best john <unk> voice can i be of assistance ma'am '' 
 she is on the phone with the manager trying to get the thing started and says sure go ahead and try '' 
 the screen has frozen on a keyboard not detected error you know press f1 
 i 've got this 
 walked into their office and unplug the first keyboard i see and walk back out with it 
 plug it in f1 and we are in 
 did n't even need a ps/2 to usb adapter 
 of course it 's xp 
 everything fires up but some terminal windows come up with a message of transaction logs not found '' 
 the system reboots 
 as patrick <unk> would say in his best captain <unk> voice damn '' 
 ok i think i 've got this 
 our company like so many others will milk old computers for as long as they can seriously why not 
 all our old computers that are not on ups give us hell on loss of power 
 go into bios settings and the computer has reverted to 2003. tell the computer it 's 2015 and it fires up no problem 
 the bar explodes in a standing <unk> as drinks are flowing once more <unk> are placed on my head the mayor actually in the bar she 's a regular commands a <unk> in my honor and i am told that the bar is buying my drinks tonight 
 glad i 'm not working <unk> since my last story was <unk> taken down i dug up another one from my memories 
 two years ago a teacher at my school who is <unk> tech-illiterate needed some help with her ipad 
 she told me that it would n't turn on so i asked to see it 
 there were no visible signs of damage 
 i asked her when it broke and she told me that it had broken over winter break when she was in hawaii 
 i asked her if she knew what happened to it and she said to me : & gt $ teacher : well i dropped it in the sand on the beach 
 and 
 there was n't a single grain of sand ... & gt skateguy2000 : i do n't see any sand on it or in it 
 how did you get the sand out of it 
 & gt $ teacher : i walked down to the water and rinsed it off silly 
 wut 
 & gt skateguy2000 : you mean you wiped it off with water or you actually rinsed it in the ocean 
 & gt $ teacher : i <unk> it in the water and rinsed it off 
 is something wrong with that 
 & gt skateguy2000 : actually yes 
 something is wrong with that 
 you ca n't put your electronics in water 
 she looked at me like she had just witnessed a murder 
 & gt skateguy2000 : water <unk> electricity and the electronic parts inside the ipad that are n't supposed to touch will make electrical contact and it will break 
 & gt $ teacher : but i 've washed off my phone and laptop before 
 i stared at her for a few seconds 
 then i looked at the ipad 
 then back at her 
 & gt skateguy2000 : it 's a miracle they survived that 
 you should n't do that in the future 
 she walked away in silence 
 sometimes people just need some common sense talked into them 
 **edit : ** holy shit this blew up thank you all so much 
 **edit 2 : ** to everyone who keeps talking about <unk> and <unk> water i know about all that stuff 
 i just was n't going to explain all of that to her for fear that she would misunderstand and make the same mistake again because generally water is not something you want around and especially inside your <unk> guys 
 so i posted this about two years ago but had to remove it 
 i 'm <unk> it again because you liked it so much 
 a bit of back story i work at an isp that deals with fixed-wireless and satellite internet to reach rural customers 
 i do tier 2 support for all 9 platforms that we offer 
 for those of you not familiar with the technology used here 's the breakdown fixed-wireless fw technology uses a <unk> system where our customers have a <unk> on their roof basically their modem which is connected to a power over ethernet adapter <unk> that gets a signal from a tower in the area ... essentially just an over <unk> router that sends the signal <unk> <unk> or <unk> away 
 satellite internet works the same way as your tv satellite but in <unk> 
 simple enough 
 not for some ... as you can imagine both of these <unk> for providing an internet connection can have a few draw backs like weather line of sight and best of all the the customer <unk> with the equipment 
 this story involves one of the fw systems that we have and a customer that is fairly new to the whole high speed internet game '' & gt me : thank you for calling megacorp technical how can i help you '' & gt customer : yeah we just got megacorp installed today and it wo n't work '' & gt me : okay ma'am let 's see what we can do after looking into her modem i see that it is online and should be working properly okay ma'am do you connect to the internet wirelessly or by an ethernet cable '' & gt customer : how can i tell '' 
 & gt me : well do you see a small black power supply that says <unk> and has a green light 
 if you follow that cable can you tell me what it 's plugged into '' 
 & gt customer : it says <unk> '' & gt so i get the model number and google a picture of it & gt me : okay ma'am that black box with the silver trim and the green lights it might be warm to the touch ... do you see what i 'm talking about '' 
 & gt customer : oh yes i see it '' & gt me : perfect i want you to unplug it '' & gt after asking her to unplug the router she gets up and starts walking i then hear something fall on the floor ... a <unk> or a knife maybe ... i start to get worried & gt customer : okay it 's unplugged '' & gt i look at my screen and can clearly see that our modem still has an ethernet link & gt me : ma'am i still see that the router is plugged in ... what did you unplug '' 
 & gt customer : it says <unk> '' 
 & gt awkward silence ... & gt me : umm ma'am did you unplug your <unk> '' 
 & gt customer : no i unplugged my <unk> '' & gt another awkward silence ... & gt me : '' umm okay ... may i ask why '' 
 & gt customer : you told me to unplug my black box with the silver trim green light and it ... '' & gt me : it 's warm to the touch yes ... i apparently <unk> audibly enough that people around me heard and poked their heads up ummm can i get you back over to where your modem is and out of your kitchen '' 
 tl dr- asked customer to unplug her router after giving a description and she unplugged her <unk> this is my second one today <unk> 
 but they 're both fairly short so i figured i could get away with posting another 
 we got a support request in our ticketing system <unk> mailing list '' today that i thought was particularly <unk> 
 & gt subject : * '' how do i get this script to work 
 * & gt body : '' i 'm trying to use this script : <unk> to script <unk> but i keep getting this error message 
 <unk> to run script : have you checked the preferences : allow scripts to run '' setting 
 '' * my coworker turned around gave me a look of disbelief and replied to his email <unk> the end of the error message verbatim as his only response : * '' have you checked the <unk> : allow scripts to run setting 
 * the user 's reply 
 & gt '' wow that worked 
 how 'd you figure it out so quickly '' 
 tl dr - reading and breathing at the same time is <unk> : i do inbound technical support for a large company that sells electronic devices including phones and computers 
 one day i get a call from an elderly woman $ elderly who has <unk> overseas and is currently living on her daughter’s $ daughter property 
 $ elderly’s phone and tablet have been giving her some error messages when she tries to access the internet 
 & gt ot me : thanks for contacting large company my name is oz_town how can i help you today 
 & gt $ elderly : hi ot i have a phone and tablet with me and i can’t get them to access the internet anymore 
 would you be able to help me 
 & gt ot : sure give me some background information regarding the issue and i’ll see what i can <unk> & gt $ elderly : ok well up until this morning they worked fine 
 i was able to access my email account and browse google but then this morning i get an error can not connect to network” 
 i contacted my wireless carrier back in overseas country but they referred me to you <unk> *it’s unlikely her <unk> would have been <unk> a cellular network especially with international roaming charges 
 so fair <unk> & gt ot : hmmm ok now i’m assuming you’re using a home wifi network to connect these devices to the internet correct 
 & gt $ elderly : yes i think so but it’s weird because all the other phones and computers are working 
 my daughter and her kids haven’t had any issues 
 *it’s extremely unlikely that two devices blew their wifi connections at the same time so i <unk> deeper into possible issues with their home <unk> & gt ot : insert generic home network troubleshooting questions here 
 *suddenly $ daughter’s voice comes over the line 
 * & gt $ daughter : this is $ elderly’s daughter i’m not sure why you’re <unk> our wifi network is the problem my mother’s two devices are the only ones having issues 
 everything else works fine 
 *sigh* & gt ot : i understand but before i go any further i just want to double check a few things 
 can you bring up a webpage on your phone 
 & gt $ daughter : i’ve already told you our devices are working it’s just my <unk> 
 what ... i’m getting can not connect to network as <unk> 
 * <unk> sigh 
 at this point most users get the message and see where i’m going with this* & gt ot : can you turn off your phone 's wifi and try the webpage on cellular data please 
 <unk> and behold it works on cellular data but not on wifi 
 * & gt $ daughter : well now that means three of your devices don’t work this is ridiculous 
 it’s clearly an issue with them because i have multiple computers in the house that still work fine on the same wireless network 
 i was just on facebook before 
 & gt ot : are they connected to your network wirelessly or via an ethernet cable 
 & gt $ daughter : everything in my house is wireless that’s why i’ve told you it’s an issue with your hardware 
 * $ daughter had mentioned her computer was a desktop 
 even in the 21st century it’s unusual for a desktop to be connected wirelessly so i obviously did not believe her 
 * & gt ot : sure i believe you 
 what i would like to do is for you to go to your computer and test a website for me again 
 *she huffs and begrudgingly walks over to the computer* & gt $ daughter : it works fine 
 i told you 
 & gt ot : so just to be 100 % certain you have not plugged an ethernet cable from your router into the ethernet port on your computer 
 & gt $ daughter : how many times do i have to tell you 
 this computer is wireless 
 the only cables plugged in are for power the monitor and keyboard/mouse 
 & gt ot : would you be able to double check the back of the computer 
 just to be sure 
 & gt $ daughter : this is ridiculous i’ve said it 5 times there’s no ethernet cable plugged in 
 *i make up some bullshit to convince $ daughter to <unk> & gt ot : ok gotcha however sometimes a cable can press against the ethernet port which can cause network issues on other devices connected to the same router 
 could you have a quick look for me 
 *cue 10 seconds of shuffling the desktop around* & gt ot : so what can you see 
 any cables pressing against it 
 & gt $ daughter : there’s an ethernet cable plugged in 
 *and there it is 
 finally i am victorious 
 time to let this user know who is in charge now 
 * & gt ot : sorry *the line cut out for a <unk> could you repeat that for me 
 & gt $ daughter : there is an ethernet cable plugged into the ethernet port 
 *i could practically hear her grinding her teeth in the background* & gt ot : so the computer is *not* connected wirelessly 
 & gt $ daughter : no 
 unfortunately as most of you fellow techs know users will almost never admit they were wrong and this was the best i could get 
 finally i was able to troubleshoot the wifi network and determine that it wasn’t able to establish a connection to whatever provider she was using for internet 
 i verified the devices had no hardware issues then told her to contact said provider for further support 
 i spent a few years on help desk for an airline before becoming a software dev 
 i’ll never forget my first call from $ pilot 
 & gt $ me : thanks for calling help desk how can i help you '' 
 & gt $ pilot : you guys keep breaking everything '' 
 & gt $ me : what 's wrong '' 
 & gt $ pilot : nothing is working 
 maybe if you did your job this would n't happen '' 
 i don’t let people treat me like that but i was more interested in his problem - because if a critical system was down we need to know 
 he finally calmed down a little 
 my co-workers started looking at me 
 & gt $ me : ... so what 's not working '' 
 & gt $ pilot : i ca n't login to my e-mail 
 why did you break it '' 
 & gt $ me : we did n't break anything 
 i just pulled up your account 
 it got locked out due to bad password attempts '' 
 & gt $ pilot : listen 
 if you want it fixed just say the word and i 'll call my son 
 he works for microsoft 
 i’ll have him drive over there so this won’t happen again 
 he 'll get everything fixed for good '' 
 & gt $ me : that 's not necessary 
 all we need to do is change your password '' 
 & gt $ pilot : but my son works for microsoft '' 
 i give him his new password and he promptly hangs up 
 i find out this user is constantly in trouble with hr for putting down employees but unions make it difficult to do anything about it 
 bonus : <unk> two months 
 payroll gets new software that only works on windows 
 $ pilot calls in wanting us to install it but only has apple devices and complains about the compatibility 
 you don’t know how bad i wanted to say “but your son works for microsoft ” tl dr : user locks out his account due to bad password attempts blames helpdesk and <unk> to send his son over to fix it 
 i worked tech support abroad and we had a boss that was something out of the ordinary 
 we did 1st and 2nd line helpdesk work in our respective native languages 
 our <unk> bbbbb for big bad badass bastard boss did not speak our language so he was useless for day-to-day operations but man was he ever <unk> for handling the internal troubles 
 the man was in his 40s fat short <unk> and bearded 
 he was so <unk> that he could make <unk> <unk> cry 
 he was <unk> honest straightforward and called bullshit when he saw and heard it 
 naturally the management hated him 
 he had however saved their <unk> <unk> more than once and with his complete disregard for their opinions on him his knowledge and experience they could not get rid of him 
 he also had the <unk> silk tounge i have ever seen from a tech guy 
 small ugly and fat and balding he still chatted up the most beautiful girls on account of his tounge and being the most confident bastard ever 
 i still <unk> to be like him not completely but in many things and i learned a lot from him 
 here are some war stories from the 18 months i spent at that <unk> place 
 **team meeting 
 ** bbbbb brings up a powerpoint presentation with lots of <unk> sound colours and short snippets of text 
 bbbbb : <unk> sorry 
 that was the presentation for management '' 
 bbbbb brings up another presentation with lots of text and <unk> 
 me : you have a different presentation on the account for management '' 
 bbbbb : yes you have to 
 management is retarded 
 consider them <unk> sheep to be <unk> in the right direction 
 and if they get this presentation they go <unk> pretty colours 
 and i can get what i want 
 if i show them your presentation they 'll get bored and annoyed that they do n't understand and decide against what i <unk> out of spite '' 
 <unk> collegue : hey do you know that your boss is staring at a door '' 
 me : what '' 
 collegue : yeah he has spent at least 10 minutes just staring at a door '' 
 me : really 
 he must be waiting for someone '' 
 collegue : he 's standing a metre away from it staring at it '' 
 me : i am sure there 's some <unk> ... '' collegue : who knows 
 ask him when he comes back 
 anyway i have work to do 
 see you '' 
 another 15 minutes pass and then bbbbb shows up 
 bbbbb : hi <unk> 
 what 's up '' 
 me : trying to get a hold of customers that wont answer their phones as usual 
 what about you '' 
 bbbbb : i just spent 45 minutes staring at door '' 
 me : what 
 why '' 
 bbbbb : i wanted to talk to the manager inside 
 i knocked he told me off saying 'i 'm busy 
 so i waited outside until he came out pointed at him and said 'now you 're not busy now we deal with this 
 poor guy probably just wanted to use the <unk> '' 
 me : ... '' 
 <unk> our own equipment 
 ** we worked 2nd line helpdesk and as a part of our instructions we were to have dual screens one to remote take over the customer 's system on one to have our own systems on this was standard on all help desks even 1st line in our native country but not where we were working now 
 we got brand new <unk> to replace our crt screens in 2005 
 with and started fighting about the graphics cards 
 bbbbb thought we could just open the computers and put in a new one stationary ones so it was easy 
 asset management threatened that we would lose support 
 we said hey we are 2nd line windows support we can support our own computers 
 asset management then said we would void any hardware warranty if we opened the computers 
 so that was that 
 instead we purchased silly expensive crappy usb graphics cards at least 20 times the cost of a basic graphics card capable of having two screens and <unk> them in our lockable drawers waiting for our second <unk> 
 and waited and waited 
 after several months bbbbb went more or less ballistic 
 new equipment was arriving every week but we did not get anything of it 
 instead it was used to replace old crt screens at the sales department 
 so he went after a manager about it 
 bbbbb : so when is my team getting their second screens '' 
 manager : well we have other needs to prioritise right now '' 
 bbbbb : so you are saying we are not getting them '' 
 manager : it has worked fine for two months already has it not 
 i do n't think you really need them '' 
 bbbbb : we have the budget for it '' 
 manager : well going under budget is a good thing '' 
 bbbbb comes back furious and <unk> a plan 
 using his silk tounge he chats up the girl in the reception and gets her to agree to call him before she calls asset management next time there 's a delivery 
 bbbbb : come on you <unk> 
 time for <unk> and <unk> 
 follow me '' 
 me : what 
 what are we doing '' 
 bbbbb : you shame your <unk> - i would have said <unk> and they would have had their <unk> out 
 we 're stealing our second screens of course '' 
 me : very well '' 
 so we went there took screens off the pile of delivered equipment and ran back with them 
 as we are <unk> them the manager comes running 
 manager : what are you doing '' 
 bbbbb : installing our second screen '' 
 manager : you have not been assigned this equipment '' 
 bbbbb : oh i did not know that 
 well we have the budget for it so you can just order some more screens right 
 no harm done '' 
 fighting bbbbb over this when the screens were already in place he had registered them in the asset management system they were in operation and we had the budget was too much for management so we got to keep the screens 
 <unk> it <unk> for <unk> 
 ** the country we were working in used the euro and we all got lots and lots and lots of useless 1 and 2 <unk> copper coins commonly called brownies and change everytime we bought something 
 i managed to use most of mine when i was riding the bus 
 you could only use 5 <unk> and bigger in the <unk> machine so the smaller ones were useless and lots of people assembled large amounts of them 
 so for fun and giggles we started paying <unk> to each other as we passed each others desks 
 basically just dumping whatever brownies you had at hand when you passed to the <unk> of the one sitting there 
 then a poor guy went back home for an extended weekend came back and found his desk covered in brownies 
 most of the building had seen them accumulating on his desk and took the opportunity to dump their change there as well 
 there were easily <unk> coins on his desk 
 he sighed and cursed a bit when he got back 
 then he got a really slow case - some of the users on his account <unk> local admins and now and then they would get a case with a computer completely filled with spyware and malware 
 he told the user to go home after lunch connected to his computer and started the cleanup 
 being bored just watching the status bar <unk> its way through the cleanup he started sorting piling and <unk> the coins on his desk 
 after a while bbbbb passes by sees on the screen that he is working nods and keeps walking 
 after a short while he returns and points to a small <unk> of coins 
 bbbbb : that is one euro is n't it '' 
 collegue : yeah why '' 
 bbbbb throws a <unk> bill on the desks and proceeds to <unk> in five piles of coins with a <unk> smile 
 collegue : nice 
 but what are you doing with the coins '' 
 bbbbb : the girls at the cafeteria fucked with me yesterday 
 i 'm going for a coffee '' 
 <unk> well 
 ** me and bbbbb are part of a documentation group 
 management recently changed the document standard for no real reason at all so we need to lift everything we 've done to the new format 
 manually as they do n't provide any kind of <unk> with the new format 
 bbbbb : management 
 i swear to god if i could see their <unk> genepool ... '' me : they do n't have a genepool 
 they have a <unk> '' 
 bbbbb : ... '' me : what '' 
 bbbbb : i have taught you well young <unk> '' 
 <unk> what we want 
 ** a team meeting discussing the latest ideas of <unk> from management trying to <unk> the disaster it would bring 
 bbbbb : ... alright then we have a good plan '' 
 collegue : yeah then we get exactly what we want '' 
 me : <unk> <unk> covered in honey '' 
 collegue : no i ... '' he goes silent for a second thinks and then breaks up in a big smile 
 yeah '' 
 bbbbb : i really like how you think <unk> 
 let me google that 
 <unk> '' 
 <unk> that is <unk> we also had a software distribution team that was <unk> due to <unk> changes 
 it also continued to work together with the team in the home country for several months since they had a long notice time 
 so there was work for 3 people and there were 8 persons doing it 
 one of the guys at our place got bored got a new job and gave his 4 week 's notice 
 since there were so little work and the other 3 guys were not fully trained yet as they got too little work to do to properly train he and them agreed that he would not do any work for the 4 weeks notice time 
 so he installed world of warcraft on his machine and sat there playing for 4 weeks 
 bbbbb who knows the situation walks by and spots the collegue playing wow 
 bbbbb : what are you doing '' 
 collegue : playing wow '' 
 bbbbb : what level are you '' 
 collegue : 32 '' 
 bbbbb : haha i am better than you '' 
 he then proceeds to walk off 
 edit : <unk> ago i worked for a company that sold <unk> software 
 our product scheduled staff according to <unk> need employee <unk> and business rules 
 it was pretty neat it could store data to a number of <unk> including a proprietary database format on a local drive 
 we had one client that chose to use the latter database format while they were in beta testing 
 i taught all the employees involved in the project how to do everything and things went well at first 
 one day about halfway through beta their database started getting corrupted frequently but with no <unk> pattern 
 i was at wit 's end and the clients management was starting to doubt our product so naturally i was worried 
 we had great recovery tools and never lost data but it was a serious <unk> 
 after a lot of back & amp forth with questions i went back to roots troubleshooting 
 the client 's rep and i had a call in which we walked through a typical day 's procedures for data <unk> <unk> and running reports 
 everything she did was 100 % correct so i was baffled why we were having problems 
 until she interrupted me saying * '' hold on the screen is scrambled up 
 * i replied saying what do you mean scrambled up '' 
 she replied * '' oh well when the elevator goes by the screen gets all mixed up with static 
 * and oddly enough the data file was corrupted once again 
 skip to the punch line : they moved my rep 's desk next to a large electric elevator and the <unk> interference was <unk> her computer 
 i told her to move the pc to a less <unk> noisy location and after one more data recovery there were no more issues 
 sometimes location is as important in it as it is in real <unk> tfts remember my last story about the girl who brought me her monitor instead of the pc 
 today i had a similar situation 
 last week i sold a new imac to one of our customers because he did n't want to deal with viruses anymore bullshit i know 
 and since he already had a macbook he did n't want me to install it at his home 
 today he called in furious anger : me : hello this is ... customer : how dare you ripping me off like that 
 me : good day sir you do n't mind telling me the problem before you scream like a maniac 
 customer : you know exactly what you did you ripped me off 
 i have all the right to scream 
 since he did n't bother to tell me his name i looked up his phone number in our <unk> and saw that i sold him an imac a week ago me : if i have to guess there 's something wrong with your imac 
 customer : damn right there 's something wrong with my imac 
 you did n't give me the whole thing 
 me : how did n't i send the whole thing 
 customer : you just gave me the freaking monitor 
 me : have you tried to plug it in and turn it on before 
 customer goes away from the phone i hear the typical apple boot sound and the customer hangs up the phone ... tl dr : customer thought i was ripping him off by just sending the monitor he ordered an <unk> quick story that happened today this is my second day of my first it job 
 serving a local <unk> 600+ users 200+ computers you get the idea 
 i was minding my own business patching in the new office space when a my work phone called 
 **user** & gt i ca n't teach like this <unk> working the screen is black 
 i need you here now '' 
 **xnikxx** & gt '' sir what room are you located in '' 
 **user** & gt room 34 i need you here now '' 
 **xnikxx** & gt and are you talking about the smartboard or the monitor for your pc '' 
 at this point the user hung up i begrudgingly made my way to the room 
 by the time a couple of minutes max i 'd got there this user had called <unk> times each time telling me to hurry up 
 i walked into the room saw the board was working just fine and observed the monitor which was being mirrored by the smartboard mind you had not jug lead connected 
 at this point the user was already agitated and i did n't really want to make him seem incompetent in front of his class 
 **xnikxx** & gt when did you first notice the issue with the monitor '' 
 **user** & gt it started just before i called you the cable at the back was irritating me i kept <unk> it so i took it <unk> 
 i had to explain to a teacher that it was a power cable the issue started the moment he unplugged it and somehow he did n't put two and two together 
 **edit** tried to fix the formatting the best i can sorry about that 
 this was from several years back when i was working as roaming tech support for a number of urgent care facilities 
 management had come up with a brilliant way of <unk> a few extra dollars from <unk> generating more revenue by selling a computer clean up & amp maintenance '' package 
 basically this meant i would run updates by hand use $ <unk> to clean up temporary files and if need be i would open up the case and vacuum out some dust 
 monday morning 
 a new client so i decide to hit their office first 
 new clients just love when it shows up first thing 
 makes them feel important 
 the manager at $ <unk> thought herself quite tech-savvy 
 i 'm moving from computer to computer and there were about 17 at this one location doing my thing 
 it usually takes me about <unk> minutes to get everything cleaning and updating before i would move on to the next 
 $ manager would follow me around from computer to computer all the while giving me <unk> style commentary tips and play by plays 
 everything is going swimmingly 
 the office staff loves me 
 i 'm being charming chatting with the nurses while working on the computers 
 * '' you can type without looking 
 cool 
 * says $ cutefrontdeskgirl 
 yeah 
 cool 
 as i get to the last couple of computers i 'm thinking that i just <unk> this first visit 
 that 's when i hear $ manager come stomping down the hall 
 & gt ** $ manager : ** what did you do to my documents '' 
 & gt **me : ** i 'm sorry 
 i have n't touched any documents '' 
 *thinking on my feet i immediately follow that up with * let 's go take a look at your computer 
 i 'm sure they 're still there '' 
 we get to her computer she <unk> into the keyboard loudly her four character password 
 & gt ** $ manager : ** i do n't know what you did but you need to fix it 
 all of my documents are gone '' 
 without asking her to move i reach for the mouse and open the my documents '' folder 
 there are dozens of files and pictures mostly of one of those little <unk> dogs - fitting 
 i look at the folder confused and then back to the manager 
 & gt **me : ** sorry are these not the documents you 're referring to '' 
 & gt ** $ manager : ** <unk> <unk> no 
 not those documents '' 
 she <unk> the mouse from me and to my disbelief double clicks on the recycling bin 
 & gt ** $ manager : ** i had dozens of documents in the recycling bin 
 i need those files '' 
 dumbfounded i say nothing for probably 20 seconds as i look from her <unk> stare to the computer screen and back 
 & gt **me : ** so ... you keep your documents in the recycling bin '' 
 & gt ** $ manager : ** i 'm not an idiot 
 my normal documents are n't in there 
 just the ones that we reuse all the time 
 like the patient sign in forms and things like that '' 
 it hits me like a ton of bricks 
 she thinks that the recycling bin is for recycled '' or reuse '' documents 
 & gt ** $ manager : ** why on earth would you delete my documents '' 
 an hour later and a <unk> later her documents were back 
 i moved them into a new folder and spent the next 30 minutes trying to explain to her that the recycling bin '' was for deleting documents 
 $ manager being tech-savvy as she was held her ground and <unk> refused to believe me 
 it was n't until $ cutefrontdeskgirl came over and agreed with me that she finally <unk> 
 context : i work at a wireless phone service and i 'm the highest level of tech support 
 *customer calls in pretty <unk> me : hi sorry for the long wait how can i assist you today '' 
 customer : are you a supervisor 
 i specifically need to talk to a supervisor in billing support '' 
 me : no ma'am i 'm in tech support are you having a technical issue or a billing issue '' 
 customer : why are n't you a supervisor '' 
 me : umm i guess because i did n't apply '' 
 at the time my supervisor was listening to the team 's calls and happened to be listening to mine 
 he almost fell out of his chair laughing 
 i kinda got in trouble for saying that but i could n't resist upon such a ridiculous question 
 hey <unk> i 'm back with a story that happened recently 
 it started with a guy who looked like he was maybe in his fifties but generally pretty nice as he approached the tech support counter 
 he was with a woman who seemed a lot younger and they smile and set a new lenovo laptop on the counter explaining that they want to hook it up to a projector 
 i tell them that their laptop has an hdmi port so all they 'll need to do is grab an hdmi cable which can be found in several places in our store 
 the man seems confused and pulls out a packaged adaptor one end usb 
 & gt man : well we found this 
 can we use this '' 
 i explain that no that particular adaptor wo n't work it wo n't transfer over the picture 
 i explain that the only port for this on his laptop is an hdmi and if the projector for some reason does not have <unk> he can get an adaptor to go to vga 
 at that he nods and says that he wants to use vgu '' that he has to all the devices he has has these <unk> '' and nothing uses hdmi 
 he wants to know how he can use a vgu '' port on his laptop 
 & gt me : sir your laptop does not have vga 
 you can get an adaptor but it 's a lot more efficient to get an hdmi cable '' 
 & gt man : okay well sweetie no one uses this hdmi '' in the real world 
 everywhere has vgu '' 
 i understand you like your high tech stuff but the world real does not use hdmi '' 
 i literally stared at him as he ranted for the next 5 minutes about the real world not using hdmi 
 it was condescending enough i stared at him let him finish and just said okay '' 
 that seemed to alert him that maybe he 's being a jerk and he <unk> for <unk> me about it it 's just that really no one uses hdmi '' 
 <unk> thanks mister it 's a wonder how i got this job 
 good thing i have smart clients like you to <unk> me on my job 
 the entire time the woman he 's with is rolling her eyes as he rants and finally speaks up 
 & gt woman : she 's saying this is what is going to work with your computer 
 this is what you get for buying something new 
 new things use hdmi 
 our projector has hdmi your stuff is old let 's go get a cable '' 
 i think i fell in love 
 regardless the man stops ranting about the real world '' and is dragged off to go get a cable 
 **edit : wow 
 was not expecting the response that i got here thank you guys 
 as a note i understand that a lot of places still use vga 
 that 's fine 
 what i was pointing out was that he brought his laptop to me to ask how to connect it and then ranted and <unk> when my answer used the hdmi port his laptop had and apparently his projector has as well 
 while it 's fine that some places still utilize vga it 's ignorant to assume hdmi is unused as he was trying to say 
 hdmi is in the majority of consumer products such as tvs and laptops and is <unk> in business devices as well 
 not everyone has made the switch but the real world '' does in fact use hdmi 
 ** <unk> : quote of the day 
 thank you again 
 i 'm happy to see that me venting about work has been so well received 
 <unk> to work at $ company who built and maintained all the electronics for $ <unk> i get a call from one of our field techs one evening 
 this is <unk> may i have your store number '' 
 fieldtech : yeah hi i 'm going to need a new atm sent over to store xyz this one is shot 
 sure i can help with that which parts were you needing replaced '' 
 fieldtech : no i ca n't fix it ... i 'm going to need an entire unit 
 now at this point i 'm confused because the entire system is <unk> so we can replace broken parts individually 100 % of the time - regardless of the issue 
 sir we do n't replace entire units just the parts 
 i can send you are many parts as you need however just submit a ticket with the list and i 'll get it approved '' 
 fieldtech : no this thing is shot i ca n't fix it 
 they need a new one 
 frustrated i try a new approach 
 ok if you would like i can get someone from level 2 on the line to help you troubleshoot these issues '' 
 <unk> : no they ca n't help me it 's shot 
 just send a new one 
 by this time i 'm pretty irritated the guy works for our company as a direct hire - he knows the rules ... this is n't a thing 
 once again we are unable to send out a new unit ... but let 's start from the beginning 
 can you describe for me the specific problems you are experiencing so we can diagnose the point of <unk> '' 
 fieldtech : it 
 is 
 shot 
 like six times wait ... it suddenly dawns on me like ... bullet holes '' 
 <unk> : yes 
 someone shot up your atm with bullet holes 
 suddenly every head within 6 <unk> pop up over the <unk> like <unk> 
 fieldtech : yes that 's what i 've been trying to tell you this whole time 
 i 'm uh ... going to put you on hold for a second to get manager approval '' 
 i put him on hold bypass the curious faces and walk over to my supervisor to relay the story 
 tech 123 is on the phone with a shot atm and wants a replacement '' without looking up he waves me off we do n't do that and he knows it - make him fix it '' 
 i grin and pause for dramatic effect until he looks up at me 
 actual bullet holes '' he jumps up and races over to my desk 
 apparently some <unk> up guy <unk> in late one night and could n't make his card work so he pulled out a pistol and emptied a clip into the atm and left 
 about half the bullets went wild into the wall and other surrounding machines which were owned by other providers 
 my boss had to hold a special meeting with engineering to explain the unusual circumstances since the cops would n't let anyone touch the current one while it was considered evidence '' 
 never found out if they caught the <unk> i should share another story from a few years ago 
 this one is a happier story though to lead into the new week with 
 so a few years ago we had some political event in the city 
 because of all the foreign <unk> and so on it was decided that the city was essentially on a public holiday for one day only as parts of the city would be shut down 
 this meant that we were getting a paid day off even though we were far away from anywhere affected so a lot of us were looking forward to it 
 the friday before the day off a monday some of us were having after work drinks in one of the common areas and the sales manager asks a serious question : who is working from tech support over the shut down '' 
 only the city is shutting down 
 the rest of the country still needs support 
 a few moments before he said this i had seen my coworker leave for the day 
 i also knew my boss and supervisor lived over an hour away and could already tell that because i lived ten minutes away i was going to be the likely candidate 
 my manager immediately decided that this had to be decided now and i was called into his office to discuss this 
 he knew i had no plans for the day from an earlier discussion but was n't going to screw me over in leave time either 
 he offered that if i came in he 'd give me two and a half days off in place of my standard day off 
 we also knew that it would possibly be quite so he told me flat out to bring in video games books etc to keep myself <unk> 
 i made the deal agreed to come in and even got money to order pizza 
 so far the deal was a good one in my mind 
 on the day i had to work i enjoyed a five minute drive to work all green lights no traffic 
 a parking space right out the front and then sat in a dim office for a few hours not being sure where the light switches were 
 i wandered around a few times i got maybe five calls that day and was pretty sure i was the only one in the building 
 i 'm basically sitting there earning a half week free holiday by playing <unk> 
 about midday the managing director turns up 
 i realise this when the lights all turn on and he finds i 've been sitting in mood lighting for the past few hours 
 we chat back and forth a bit he has come in to catch up on some paperwork and go about our business 
 after an hour or so he starts to get bored and begins wandering around the building we 've only been there a few months if memory serves me right and he was prone to go exploring 
 he appears while im becoming the <unk> of chickens with a very serious expression 
 <unk> i 've found something and need your help '' 
 ok what 's up 
 he produces from the other side of the partition a few bags of crisps i found these on a shelf in the storage room 
 they expire a few months from now 
 if we leave them there they could go off and someone could get sick 
 for the good of the business we should eat these now '' 
 i have no problem with this plan 
 also this orange juice '' 
 a tray appears with a dozen or so <unk> from where the crisps were 
 i believe i can help with this assignment 
 good 
 i knew i could count on you 
 i 'll do my share as well 
 remember if this food is left in a few months it could be an oh & amp s issue '' 
 he returns to his office with his own drinks and crisps 
 for the next few hours i basically <unk> to the tech <unk> stereotype drinking <unk> drinks and eating junk food 
 every so often he comes to <unk> on my progress offer a fact from under the lid of an orange juice bottle and generally tell me i 'm doing a good job 
 later that day he appears with more food and drink and asks if i want some as i had said i was catching up with friends that night and he thinks they can help with this dangerous matter 
 yes yes they can 
 also as thanks from the company have these <unk> shirts '' 
 wait are you just <unk> the marketing stash 
 these are for an old promotion but there is nothing wrong with them 
 they probably forgot about them '' 
 cool 
 free clothes 
 as i 'm leaving i stop by his office to say thanks and goodbye 
 he waves goodbye and says in the <unk> tone just remember you may have saved some lives today '' 
 i laugh and leave 
 all is good 
 a few weeks later people are sorting out after work drinks and at some point he must have been asked what happened to the crisps and juice 
 the first i hear of it is when he leads someone from marketing to my desk makes me stand up and says lives were in danger 
 this man is a hero 
 and leaves with no more explanation 
 tl dr. ate junk food management claimed i saved lives because of it 
 edit : well this seems to have got a lot of interest 
 i 'm pretty shocked 
 also thank you for the gold <unk> i 'm just upstairs on middle management 's floor to grab a usb stick when i hear someone cursing 
 it 's the internet product technical director a weird job description 
 technically nobody is directly under him but anything that has to do with the internet at our telco falls under his broad purview 
 i know for a fact he 's incredibly well paid 
 i 'm admittedly not his biggest fan 
 & gt bytewave : what 's wrong '' 
 & gt ipd : i fucking closed a tab with a <unk> words text i was about to send on internal forums 
 <unk> 
 there ought to be a confirmation prompt when you close a tab '' 
 ... & gt bytewave : you use firefox right '' 
 & gt ipd : yeah so '' 
 & gt bytewave : please state your full work title '' 
 & gt ipd : what 
 you know what i do hell you know my damn browser it 's been well over a decade <unk> '' & gt bytewave : yeah sure i know 
 please state your full work title '' 
 & gt ipd : <unk> internet product technical director ... '' & gt bytewave : thank you that was for dramatic effect 
 now hit <unk> shift t. '' & gt ipd : ... oh 
 yes 
 but ... '' & gt bytewave : ... thank you for calling senior line your call was very important to you '' 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 this literally just happened and it 's got me feeling kind of bad 
 i work over the phone tech support for mobile phones and had a lady calling in saying she could n't download anything on her android because she kept getting an insufficient storage '' error 
 pretty standard after asking a few questions and remoting into her phone we see it 's mostly pics about <unk> worth on an 8gb phone 
 easy stuff let 's back them up to google photos since she does n't have an sd card or a computer 
 we set up google photos and it 's starting the backup 
 now when a customer is in their photos app or gallery it <unk> out their screen for privacy reasons i assume and i ca n't see anything their doing even though i 'm remoted in 
 i tell her it can take a little bit to backup especially if she has a lot etc ... suddenly i notice her devices available memory increasing 
 it shows this when we 're remoted in to the phone she says im deleting photos now '' 
 i say we need to wait for the backup to complete '' 
 to which she replies ... i saw the pics they were all in the photos app '' 
 i know it takes longer than that 
 i reiterated - we need to make sure they 're backed up '' 
 her : i saw them they 're there '' 
 oh lord 
 i knew what happened and there was a silence on the line and she said all my photos are gone 
 they were just there '' 
 cue angry customer who deleted her photos because i told her to '' 
 i hope someone goes back and listens to that call 
 they 'll see i told her to wait multiple times 
 plus google photos will free up device storage on its own only removing backed up ones 
 i told her that too 
 ugh 
 just venting now because even though i did n't do it i still feel really bad that she lost her pictures 
 : / edit : corrected a <unk> <unk> are my favorite people ... & gt me : <unk> technical support <unk> <unk> & gt her : this is <unk> in accounting i tried to run a trial balance and my computer is locked up 
 & gt me : easy fix <unk> 
 there 's a known bug in the <unk> accounting software package 
 if you click the trial balance button twice your computer will lock up 100 % resource usage 
 simply reboot your computer and you should be good to go 
 & gt her : will you stay on the line while i do this 
 & gt me : sure 
 she reboots her machine reboot # 1 & gt her : okay here we go i distinctly hear click 
 click 
 & gt her : nope same issue 
 & gt me : did i just hear two clicks 
 did you click the button twice 
 & gt her : no 
 whining ca n't you just come over here and fix it 
 we 're on the same floor and they have a great coffee machine over in accounting so i agree 
 reboot # 2 & gt me : okay here i am did you reboot your computer again 
 & gt her : yes i did 
 now watch 
 click ... <unk> ... & gt me : you just clicked it twice 
 & gt her : <unk> i was n't sure if i clicked it 
 reboot # 3 
 & gt me : okay click the button one time now 
 she clicks ... <unk> ... 5 seconds <unk> 
 she clicks again 
 <unk> 
 & gt me incredulous : did n't i just tell you to click the button one time 
 & gt her : my husband is in the hospital 
 <unk> <unk> i 'm not sure what sort of response i was expecting but that was certainly not it 
 reboot # 4 and everything worked 
 minding my own business on helpdesk and the phone rings 
 answer the phone customer immediately demands to know status of ticket 
 ask customer for ticket number customer asks why i dont have it already 
 explain they 're calling us from a phone number not listed on any systems we utilize most likely their personal cell which is a big no no 
 customer grumbles about stupid cell phone rule and locates ticket number 
 i pull up ticket and see it 's assigned to another group on east coast 
 explain to customer they will need to be connected to other group for status update as only notes on ticket from staff handling it are <unk> as to status 
 customer refuses to be connected to them 
 customer hangs up 
 customer calls back 
 same routine 
 customer hangs up again 
 customer calls back again 
 for the sake of my sanity i tell customer i will contact staff handling their ticket for them and that i will call them back in 2-3 hours 
 i 've got a lunch to take and my own crap to deal with before this moron 's disaster to clean up 
 customer and i then proceed to have this conversation verbatim : & gt user : okay well i 'm on the east coast so do you mean 2-3 east coast hours '' 
 & gt me : i mean 2-3 hours 
 hours are hours '' 
 & gt '' right but i 'm on the east coast and you said you 're in central time so you are you talking about central hours or eastern hours '' 
 & gt '' sir it does n't matter if you 're on the east coast or the west coast or in <unk> an hour is an hour '' 
 & gt '' but i 'm on the east coast 
 it 's an hour sooner here '' 
 & gt '' sir i mean 2-3 hours or <unk> minutes from now '' 
 & gt '' that does n't answer my question '' 
 & gt '' how about this sir 
 it 's <unk> am your time right now right 
 i 'll call you before the clock on your desk says <unk> pm '' 
 & gt '' oh okay so 3 east coast hours '' 
 *tl dr : 60 minutes is only an hour if you 're not on the east coast 
 * hi tfts thought it was about time i shared this little anecdote 
 about 3 years ago i worked at a national newspaper in the tech support department 
 my team of 2 was responsible for <unk> and <unk> which meant our tickets were always related to internet connection issues or problems with their desk phones 
 we had an sla service level agreement to respond to a ticket within 3 hours and resolve it within 3 days which was pretty reasonable considering we received so few tickets in to our queue thanks to our surprisingly <unk> first line support team 
 so one day at around 2pm while my colleague is trying to get me to go with him to the pub for the remainder of the day our empty queue receives a ticket 
 i 'm so bored at this point i snap it up 
 a journalist who tech support refer to as <unk> is unable to make phone calls from her desk phone 
 so ignoring my colleagues desire for a <unk> drink i jump up and dash off to the journalists desk to deal with her problem 
 the second i arrive she starts yelling at me 
 does n't even say hello or explain her problem 
 just starts yelling at me and bear in mind that it 's a fully open plan office of over 1000 people that she ca n't make any f***ing phone calls '' and it 's an absolute <unk> '' etc etc 
 after a few seconds of this i stopped listening to the specifics of her angry shouting and eventually cut her off and calmly explained i have an sla to respond within 3 hours 
 i 've arrived within 15 minutes 
 so i 'm going to go away and come back in another 2 hours and 45 minutes and if you 've calmed down by then i 'll take a look at your phone '' and walked off leaving her standing by her desk mouth wide and speechless 
 it was still a very quiet day so i returned about an hour later 
 this time she did n't say a word and just gestured towards her phone 
 at which point i lean over and plug the ethernet cable back in to it and the phone boots up as normal 
 she <unk> around a look of disbelief on her face and says that 's it 
 it just needed to be plugged in '' 
 to which i respond well if you 'd let me look at it earlier rather than shouting about it i could have dealt with it then 
 short pause is there anything else i can help you with '' 
 to which she replies sheepishly no awkward pause thank you '' 
 i felt pretty good about closing that ticket 
 tl dr <unk> journalist just needed to plug her desk phone <unk> brings in a laptop for service sets it on the front counter 
 i <unk> to open the lid and at least a half dozen roaches immediately crawl out of the vents a quickly start to <unk> out everywhere over my front counter 
 i start tracking down and smashing said roaches and lady hands son the laptop tells him to <unk> outside and shake the laptop out - during which i politely explain that you ca n't just <unk> them out of a laptop and that unfortunately i wo n't be able to check the laptop in this condition in for service 
 now let 's be logical for a moment shall we 
 the way i stay in business is to check in computers for service so if i 'm turning it away there is good reason 
 the cost of paying to get rid of the roaches would greatly exceed the money we 'd make servicing her laptop 
 plus liability issues if they got in other customer 's machines 
 plus ... <unk> 
 anyway i do my best to explain politely several times that we ca n't check it in - but she 's not having any of it 
 & gt '' you wo n't even look at it and tell me what 's wrong '' 
 finally she gives up and starts storming out & gt '' ... well 
 we 'll never come back here again ... <unk> i 've got six family members and i 'll make sure they know to never come here 
 so you just lost six customers ... '' you know whenever i hear the i 'll never come here again '' 
 line i always have to bite a hole in my lip to keep from saying promise '' 
 i traveled to <unk> recently with my dad and sister 
 i 'm british but my dad is <unk> and speaks the language farsi 
 my sister and i do n't speak farsi at all and it means we 're usually bored when we 're dragged to family friends houses and everyone speaks farsi 
 anyway one day we went to a family friend 's house for lunch 
 after eating lunch people were just sitting around talking in farsi for literally hours and i got pretty bored so i went on my phone and searched for a wifi network so i could browse reddit keep in mind i do n't have access to <unk> on my british phone so i need wifi 
 no wifi networks found so i had to endure more boredom 
 what i would usually do is find out if a network is available and if so if they have a password get my dad to ask them for it politely in farsi 
 in this case as i could n't find a network i just forgot about it and assumed they either did n't have internet access or just had a wired connection with a single pc 
 anyway later on my sister asks me if they have wifi as she was bored 
 i told her that i could n't find any networks 
 about an hour after that i told my dad we were really bored and they had no wifi 
 my dad then insisted on asking the homeowner if we could use their wifi despite no networks being available 
 the following conversation took place with my dad speaking farsi to the homeowner and <unk> everything i say in english : & gt <unk> : do you mind if we use your wifi 
 & gt **homeowner** : sure just switch on your bluetooth 
 & gt **me** : wait ... what 
 bluetooth 
 surely you mean wifi 
 & gt **homeowner** : no i mean bluetooth you 'll need that to use our wifi i decided to humour him and just switch on my bluetooth 
 no devices found 
 i showed homeowner 
 & gt **homeowner** : that 's strange let me show you my phone 
 he then shows me that his phone 's wifi is switched off the bluetooth is switched on and he 's paired with another device which he 's using the internet connection of 
 & gt **me** : whose device are you connected to 
 how come you 're using that instead of a wifi router 
 & gt **homeowner** : i have no idea what you 're talking about 
 my son set it all up for me he 's good with computers 
 & gt **me** : ummm ... ok. so i investigate further and found their home wifi '' network works like this : - the family do n't have broadband or a wifi router at all 
 - homeowner 's son has 3g on his phone and is bluetooth paired with his dad 's phone 
 - security settings on both devices mean neither can be found by other devices e.g 
 my iphone and both devices trust each other 
 - if homeowner 's son 's phone moves too far away from his his phone loses internet as he does n't have 3g on his own phone 
 this meant he had no internet if he was at home but his son was n't at home 
 their son spoke a tiny bit of english so i spoke to him and he said we had to do the following : - he adds my iphone to his phone 's bluetooth trusted devices list 
 - ask homeowner if it 's okay if we <unk> his phone and then pair mine as multiple devices ca n't be paired to his phone 
 - pair my phone and use his 3g connection 
 i then suggested just setting up a hotspot on his phone and then both homeowner and i connect by <unk> wifi** 
 he had no idea what i was talking about 
 homeowner was also unhappy about <unk> his phone from his son 's on the grounds that we 're changing everything '' 
 my dad was unable to explain <unk> in farsi the benefits of using wifi instead of bluetooth so basically i could n't use the internet 
 a new life goal of mine is to learn farsi go back there and actually help them with this mess 
 **tldr : ** tech <unk> + language barrier = boredom and <unk> few requested that i finish the story here i guess i want to let it out this all happened a while back and i have never really opened up about it 
 so after the events detailed the previous post there was an uncomfortable apology from the boss that could be translated as <unk> i have to apologise again but i will expose you one day 
 this was a very stressful workplace 
 a culture of paranoia coupled with a <unk> technical capacity in management created many <unk> worthy events during the short time i was there 
 for example : & gt boss who is this alpha why did you have him test our software '' 
 & gt me explains that alpha testing is people in our own company providing feedback '' & gt boss people should not be pointing out problems in our software it 's <unk> to the company 
 i want to see all these <unk> in my office now '' 
 anyway there was a series of <unk> accusations some <unk> funny others just sad eg accusing me of stealing the <unk> cables from a left over motherboard box 
 the results were always the same me proved <unk> innocent and two apologetic '' managers only more determined to justify their persecution of myself 
 it got quite <unk> after a while 
 long hours at a keyboard left me with bad <unk> tunnel 
 cold triggered the pain and hot water <unk> it 
 so i often did the dishes for the company a chance to <unk> pain 
 management became aware of why i was being so helpful and enforced a new rule that staff were not allowed to use hot water for cleaning dishes yep you read that right 
 every time the tap was found to be warm it was inspected regularly i was accused of breaking company policy and <unk> over the <unk> 
 always another employee would come forward and explain they had used hot water to clean a coffee cup and i was not at fault 
 thanks guys if your reading this anyway <unk> of hot water not being enough to <unk> my <unk> out of <unk> <unk> management now <unk> 16 <unk> <unk> air con standard 
 and a table set outside my office held a burning incense thing that management had discovered triggered my <unk> 
 then came a big problem 
 the two managers would be away for a fortnight 
 obviously chaos would rain while the tech nerds happily made free with the companies hot water 
 so one of the managers <unk> turned of the water tap to <unk> hot water system before leaving 
 again technology was not thier strong suite 
 the water was off but not the power 
 so the bloody hot water system exploded the next day 
 then something really bad happened 
 australia introduced enterprise <unk> '' a policy that destroyed many workplace rights 
 under the new system i had been forced to become a <unk> '' not an employee 
 then my wages started to be delayed '' 
 i had not been paid in two months others much longer one lady 4 months 
 in the final days before i quit we were made to sign contracts stating we would be fired <unk> pay even back pay if we were found to have broken any law in anyway even outside of the company 
 and then the persecution turned ugly 
 i was brought into a random meeting with the two managers and told that i should not be logging out of my firefox browser before leaving work 
 i said i did this so other people would not access my e-mail etc 
 they replied that <unk> myself like this was very <unk> and i should not do it 
 i did n't budge on the issue 
 one day i was rushed out of work and forgot to log out of firefox 
 i decided to go back in and do so just <unk> 
 i discovered my favorite two managers at my desk looking at my computer 
 they demanded to know why i had returned 
 i said i want to log my internet browser out 
 i got a reprimand for being paranoid and <unk> '' 
 after this i had given notice 
 another firm had made me a good offer and i was due to leave for what would turn out to be an awesome job else where 
 if i left without being fired for breaking the law however they would be forced to pay me my back wages now over $ <unk> 
 many things were attempted in vain to see if even the <unk> evidence of wrong doing could be found 
 i had never broken the law and not done anything unprofessional in the slightest 
 yet the persecution was now <unk> 
 what followed in my final weeks : -a software licence we were using expired 
 when it failed to start i was accused of stealing '' the licence for myself 
 -a consultant was hired under pretext of job handover '' 
 his real job to look over my shoulder 
 <unk> was being followed into the toilet no idea why 
 <unk> walked in having seen my car was not in the <unk> 
 shouted loudly to the whole firm that i was half an hour late and would be made an example off 
 then saw me in my office put on his shit i will have to make another formal apology '' face 
 then a dim light bulb went of in his head and instead he told me i was not allowed to park in other than my allocated spot '' 
 i told him i had taken the train today because my car was in the shop 
 he stormed away ... apology came 6 <unk> later 
 on one of my last days 
 i was sitting in my office all offices had plate glass walls and saw the other manager stomping around the office 
 she plugged her laptop into every ethernet port trying to do something got annoyed that something did not work and moved onto the next port 
 then she found the companies adsl router and plugged into that 
 she tried whatever it was she was doing and then it worked 
 she sat at the desk next to the router with her laptop and gave me a very smug look 
 this was the <unk> i finally got you '' face i had ever seen and that irritated me 
 knowing the router was a hub not a switch and that all internet traffic was going through it i quickly acted on a hunch about what i thought was going on 
 i opened up a browser window and in google typed please do n't spy on what i do on the internet '' 
 she startled in pure <unk> 
 when the shock wore off she <unk> the situation 
 i had her breaking australian law 
 she was at that time not allowed to spy on workers internet usage in this way 
 but i had no proof unless she admitted it 
 so angry as a cat in a <unk> she slammed her laptop shut and stormed into my office 
 to angry to even speak she sat down in the desk opposite mine opened <unk> laptop and just sat glaring at me 
 and there she remained for a couple of hours till my lunch break 
 just sitting <unk> <unk> and glaring 
 as for me totally <unk> and <unk> 
 for the first time in my life i just couldn’t give a f # # k any more 
 edit : since someone asked i thought i should share what the last day was like <unk> in 2008 4 years after windows nt <unk> ran out of support and 11 years after it was released we could finally convince our customers that we do n't intend to continue supporting ie 5 and that all end-users should be upgraded to ie 6 which was out for 6 years by then 
 we knew that the site was working mostly ok in <unk> but there was a nasty display glitch 
 as we have agreed with our customers to not support <unk> we were n't going to fix that glitch 
 cue the support ticket reporting the display glitch 
 we told them to upgrade their ie as the minimum version required was a then 6 years old browser 
 they told us they were running <unk> and still had the issue 
 i told them to send me a screenshot of the <unk> box of their ie and yes it was showing ie 6 though the design of the dialog box was different from my machine which made me suspicious 
 i 've told them to visit some specially crafted url that was basically listing some request <unk> 
 i told them to scroll to the line that says <unk> and to list me what it says there 
 they responded with <unk> compatible <unk> <unk> windows nt <unk> <unk> <unk> and that was the day when that company updated their 4 <unk> support os to an os that was only 7 years old at the time when this happened to windows 2000 and of which only 3 later versions already existed at that point xp 2003 server <unk> so not only did they lie about the browser version they also went through the trouble of <unk> a screenshot of the about box in the vain hope that we might magically fix the issue if we believe they were using a browser that was supported 
 of course even if we did believe them fixing an issue we can not reproduce is next to impossible 
 previous i stood with no coffee staring at a computer that wouldn’t boot 
 could life get any better 
 the red haired lady stood next to me coffee cup in hand 
 & gt redcheer : that doesn’t look right 
 & gt me : it’s broken 
 & gt redcheer : <unk> 
 & gt me : yeah that drop killed the hard drive i think 
 the red haired lady beside me did not look happy 
 she looked like she was on a war path 
 & gt redcheer : we’ve got to fix him 
 i looked around the office and spotted the famous designer that broke this pc 
 being a guest it guy what do you do in these circumstances 
 as i weighed up telling the boss or just quietly fixing the problem the red haired lady decided for me 
 & gt redcheer : dad dad 
 she had called out over the office carefree walked swiftly over 
 & gt carefree : hello again airz 
 what seems to be the problem redcheer 
 & gt redcheer : my computer’s broken 
 & gt carefree : oh dear airz haven’t you had time to fix these ones yet 
 i realized he thought the problem was the over heating but too late to say anything 
 & gt redcheer : no angryf dropped it now its not working at all 
 & gt carefree : oh dear is it fixable 
 & gt me : yeah just got ta get a new hard drive and pop it in then <unk> install everything 
 should take a day or two 
 the red haired lady seemed to calm down a lot upon hearing her pc was going to be okay 
 & gt redcheer : i’ll go find a hard drive 
 she raced off before i’d even gotten a chance to ask if she knew what a hard drive was 
 carefree looked over at the non working computer 
 he looked like he was <unk> things over 
 & gt carefree : angryf could you come over here a second 
 angryf rose from his desk and silently made his way over to the broken computer 
 & gt carefree : did you accidentally drop this computer 
 & gt angryf : well yeah but i wouldn’t have done if tech-man worked a little faster 
 & gt me : what did… 
 carefree held out his hand for silence 
 & gt carefree : you seem pretty upset with our temporary tech 
 & gt angryf : he’s pretty bad 
 could n't even fix my machine he just tried to replace it 
 i was about to start defending myself but across the open floor office i saw redcheery opening up the it cupboard and start inspecting things 
 it was very distracting 
 & gt carefree : so he’s made big impression on you 
 & gt angryf : a massive negative impression 
 yes 
 i was about to open my mouth and defend myself but again carefree raised his hand for silence 
 & gt carefree : whats his name 
 & gt angryf : what 
 & gt carefree : he’s made such a massive negative impression 
 what is his name 
 i looked back over redcheery she was holding an old power supply reading the label 
 i almost missed the look of <unk> on <unk> face 
 & gt angryf : i don’t know but it doesn’t matter 
 he’s really bad i think he broke this computer with just incompetence 
 & gt me : you <unk> carefree held up his hand again 
 & gt carefree : no use playing the blame game with someone so angry airz 
 he gave me a small smile before turning back to his most famous designer 
 & gt carefree : i think perhaps you owe airz an apology for creating so much extra work for him 
 the designer was getting worked up you could see it in his eyes 
 he wasn’t happy 
 & gt angryf : no 
 you know what no 
 carefree’s calm exterior just slid away 
 he looked just plain scary 
 & gt carefree : okay i think you should leave 
 & gt angryf : ha 
 you know you can’t get rid of me 
 i’m your best designer you’d lose thousands if i wasn’t here 
 carefree’s scary demeanor grew bigger 
 & gt carefree : do you know how i came to own a design company 
 it wasn’t by just making the best <unk> decisions 
 now get out 
 he pointed to the door 
 i followed the finger and saw redcheery holding up a hard drive like she’d found treasure 
 i smiled i couldn’t believe she found one 
 carefree must have seen the smile 
 he turned away from angryf who was leaving 
 & gt carefree : the ability to smile in awkward situations is a rare one 
 that was pretty rough lets get a coffee 
 & gt me : i think your daughter has found a hard <unk> i should probably go install that first 
 & gt carefree : don’t be silly hard drives can wait 
 you’ve just seen a firing that must have been tough 
 i made my way over to the break room 
 i honestly couldn’t tell which demeanor was <unk> the scary one or the <unk> 
 & gt me : i don’t have a <unk> carefree smiled for a second i was worried he’d offer his own 
 & gt carefree : we do have guests here occasionally 
 <unk> cups are in the bottom cupboard 
 & gt me : <unk> i forgot you’d need to offer clients coffee all the time 
 & gt carefree : haha what type of weird place wouldn’t have cups for guests 
 as i drank down my golden <unk> i listened to stories of old from carefree about his startup days 
 they were fun 
 i made my way back out to the floor and saw redcheery closing up a computer screwdriver in hand 
 & gt me : oh you’ve already installed it 
 & gt redcheer : yep 
 got ta learn how to fix my computer 
 i opened up the case and looked inside everything was connected and screwed in correctly 
 & gt me : nice work you’ve build a computer before i take it 
 & gt redcheer : oh no 
 i just looked for the thing that said <unk> <unk> and replaced it 
 wasn’t too hard 
 & gt me : so… you didn’t know what you were doing 
 & gt redcheer : i learn by doing 
 ***** learn by doing works ... who knew 
 next back in the late 90s i did troubleshooting over the phone for pcs and printers 
 this was when printers were moving off of <unk> drivers and onto those at the time really sketchy windows only drivers that were a beast to troubleshoot and would get jobs stuck in queue quite regularly 
 one day i m'lady get a call from a gentleman gent who ca n't print 
 m'lady : thank you for calling <unk> my name is m'lady how may i assist you 
 gent : i ca n't print and need help 
 m'lady : i can certainly assist you let me take a look at your account go ahead and tell me a little more about what 's happening 
 gent : says some vague things about it working earlier and now it wo n't print 
 m'lady : sir that is a very common issue that is typically resolved worth a restart of your computer 
 i do show you are out of warranty and to walk you through rebooting your computer i would have to charge you $ 25 
 or you can hang up restart and if it does n't work you can give us a call back 
 gent : he smells a <unk> and close there 's no way that 's it blah blah blah i know better 
 m'lady : sir i promise you i 've seen this hundreds of times 
 we 're open for hours yet although we did n't have a toll free number and if it does n't work you can call right back 
 gent does n't believe me and i 'm going to get scored down if i accidentally '' hang up on him 
 so we go through the 5 minutes of taking his credit card information 
 you know what 's coming 
 m'lady : ok sir click start shutdown restart and let me know when the computer is back up 
 there 's no <unk> chat 
 he thinks i 'm a fucking idiot 
 the appropriate amount of time goes by 
 gent : k is rebooted sounding smug in my memory m'lady : pick anything you want and try and print for me 
 printer noises gent : i just paid $ 25 to reboot my computer did n't i 
 m'lady : yes sir you did 
 speaking as level as i could 
 gent : & lt click & gt it was about 10pm 
 the entire building had long since gone home but i 'd stuck around to do some after-hours maintenance on a few routers in the public <unk> room where our customers <unk> all their equipment 
 when you 've been working for 13 hours straight your brain stops working the way it normally would and tends to get a narrow focus 
 one thing that 's vital for any tech is the three pocket tap 
 back right left - wallet keys phone 
 no matter where you are you can probably work something out as long as you have them 
 as i heard the <unk> door click closed i immediately realised i 'd been so caught up debugging i 'd forgotten to <unk> 
 please let them be there 
 for the love of god let them be there 
 they were not there 
 the awareness of my situation came slowly 
 no wallet means no access card 
 okay i 'll call someone 
 no phone 
 okay well i guess i can always just <unk> the work and go home 
 wait no wallet means no bus 
 i guess i could always walk i mean it 's far but .. no keys 
 it was a rare winter 's day that the <unk> datacentre was cold but dear god was it cold that night and i had no jacket 
 the <unk> of ac units hummed merrily pumping 10 degree air into the room sleeping on the floor of the datacentre was not an option although it would become one later - that 's a story for another time 
 wow 
 i was really stuck 
 i could use <unk> buttons to get further <unk> of the facility and gamble on being able to break back in somewhere else but i would only end up stuck further away from the things i so desperately wished i 'd remembered 
 * '' alright chhopsky you can do this 
 you just have to figure something out 
 this is what we trained for 
 * i checked everything 
 <unk> the door and lock did n't work 
 the lock was a strike so i could n't cut power to it either 
 i tried every technique i could think of to bypass the security 
 after half an hour i was starting to wonder whether maybe sleeping on the floor was the best plan after all and just living with <unk> 
 like a bolt of lightning genius struck 
 in one particular rack there was an old cisco 2511. for those lucky enough to have missed these things a <unk> is an ancient serial router commonly used for out of band management - stick a dial-up modem on one end and then 16 serial ports out to <unk> 
 i had a phone line 
 and i 'd been testing ports to identify phone numbers earlier in the week and by random chance i 'd left the crappy old <unk> phone in the rack 
 i was saved 
 snapping in the <unk> socket with a relieved grin i dialled the only number i knew - my home number 
 my girlfriend at the time who i 'll call pants picked up her sweet voice echoing through the <unk> line like an innocent <unk> 
 & gt pants : hello 
 & gt chhopsky : oh my god pants i 'm so happy i need y & gt pants : .. hello 
 & gt chhopsky : what 
 hello 
 pants 
 can you hear me 
 & gt pants : <unk> the <unk> yeah i do n't know who it is 
 there 's some <unk> but no-one 's talking & gt chhopsky : you have got to be kidding me 
 & gt pants : guess it 's a bad line or a fax machine or something 
 she hung up 
 i immediately called back 
 & gt chhopsky : hello 
 pants 
 hello 
 & gt pants : it 's doing the thing again .. i do n't know i think someone 's there 
 & gt chhopsky : hello i am here its chhopsky please i am stuck the receiver clicking down was the most <unk> sound of <unk> i 'd ever heard 
 i realised i 'd never actually used this phone to talk only ever to dial numbers and hit modems 
 something in it was busted so no-one was ever going to hear me through it 
 i tried to get it open to fix it but without tools which were also on the other side of the door it was n't going anywhere 
 at this point ethics kind of went out the window 
 the one <unk> thing i had in my <unk> was a <unk> key 
 for those not in the know the <unk> key is a magical key that most racks ship with by default 
 armed with a tiny piece of metal i was going to go through every customer 's rack until i found something that could help me 
 i opened every single rack in the room 
 nothing 
 no tools no tape no zip ties nothing 
 i slumped against the back wall of the back row defeated 
 that 's when i saw it 
 the most beautiful sight in the world 
 a brand new <unk> analogue phone hidden under a waterfall of console cables behind a customer 's 2511. i shouted in joy to no-one in particular thanked the gods that someone else had been doing the same work that i had and hastily stole the hell out of it 
 when i finally got through to pants i was able to talk her through logging onto my computer connecting to my work vpn <unk> into the security system and the incredibly long and <unk> process of navigating the ancient awful security software to manually override the lock 's default state to open 
 when that relay clicked it was like the <unk> were alive with the sound of metal on metal 
 i dropped the phone and busted through the door <unk> and <unk> both at once 
 i had won 
 i had beaten the impossible situation 
 *i had opened a door 
 * wrapping myself in a jacket i stood behind the <unk> heat vents in the plant room for five minutes then <unk> my wallet to my belt and got back to work 
 these routers were n't going to upgrade <unk> get a call from a user asking me to reset her password 
 no problem 
 i just need to confirm it 's in fact her so call up the security question 
 where did you meet man 's name '' 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> '' 
 that 's not the answer we have on file ma'am '' 
 that is where i met him '' 
 your hint is <unk> hot ma'am '' 
 oh yeah i forgot i changed it 
 after i divorced him i made the answer *hell* did n't i '' 
 yes you did ma'am 
 i 'll reset your password now 
 i am just a humble <unk> end-user operations manager at a bank 
 i read your tales from time to time it helps me feel better about myself - at least i 'm not that bad '' 
 anyway reading your posts has helped me communicate better with my it department 
 i used to be <unk> communicating with it folks 
 sometimes i would just live with issues rather than try and resolve them 
 i actually went 2 or 3 months with a <unk> mouse because i figured it was easier than dealing with the help desk 
 after a month or two of reading this subreddit i started to become more comfortable submitting help desk tickets 
 first i never call i always submit a ticket 
 second i always try <unk> first 
 third i do n't try to diagnose the problem myself i just state clearly what the issue is never just saying it just does n't work '' 
 if there is an error message i <unk> it or repeat it verbatim 
 lastly and perhaps most importantly i never pretend to know more than i do 
 if i do n't understand something i say so 
 you guys most of you have made it clear that you do n't expect us to know your job just like we do n't expect you to know ours 
 you just expect us to be reasonable clear and polite 
 which is exactly what we expect from you 
 anyway sorry if this post does n't belong here 
 it 's just that i had another pleasant experience with my help desk and felt like saying thank you '' 
 to all of you 
 have a nice day background : i work as an internal helpdesk technician in the corporate offices of a <unk> chain of <unk> stores 
 another day another round of users 
 this morning starts with a fairly generic ticket to fix some printer settings after a store mucked it up 
 fixed the printer but now i need the store to restart it 
 commence calling the store in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... & gt *ring ... ring ... ring ... * now where the stores are concerned policy states that it comes first 
 if someone from it is calling you pick up the phone because either something is broken or they 're giving you updates on something else that was broken either way it still <unk> your bottom line 
 four minutes of ringing go by ... no one has yet picked up the phone 
 what is a lowly tech supposed to do 
 <unk> let 's see what they 're up to 
 while the phone is still ringing i 've pulled up their security cameras and logged in 
 we 're now at six minutes of ringing 
 & gt *ring ... ring ... ring ... * there 's a man standing next to the obviously ringing phone on one of the manager computers 
 judging by his shirt he 's definitely a manager 
 as i 'm watching on the cameras he turns and looks at the ringing phone which has caller id so he can see it 's me that 's calling and goes back to his computer 
 this can not stand 
 so i remote into his computer 
 he 's writing an email - it 's a very <unk> email 
 one click later and his mouse and keyboard stop taking input 
 a <unk> grin slowly <unk> across my face as he quickly <unk> into despair that he ca n't type his email 
 he does n't take frustration well - grabbing the mouse and slamming it onto the counter hitting the keyboard ... it was actually like watching a <unk> 
 & gt <unk> <unk> & gt please pick up the phone '' 
 & gt *ring ... ring ... * hello 
 tl dr : i do n't know who you are 
 i do n't know what you want 
 if you are looking for peace and quiet i can tell you i do n't have any 
 but what i do have are a very particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career 
 skills that make me a nightmare for people like you 
 if you pick up the phone now that 'll be the end of it 
 i will not look for you i will not pursue you 
 but if you do n't i will look for you i will find you and i will call you 
 again 
 -- - previous tales on tfts : it 's a christmas miracle 
 those guys are worthless 
 absolutely worthless 
 back in july i was downtown on business and was just waiting for a cab to get back to the office 
 it was a beautiful day and all was well in the world - but a panicked man next to me clearly felt otherwise 
 he seemed angry and frustrated 
 he kept looking at his phone then the street signs then the phone again then the street signs 
 looked like he was about to throw the phone in the general direction of a brick wall 
 he was close enough i could see he was looking at the maps app and that his phone was a nexus 5 
 & gt bytewave : hey do you need directions to some place 
 looks like the phone 's not being very helpful '' 
 & gt stranger : yes oh god yes i 'm soooo late 
 there 's this restaurant i have to get to for a business lunch and the phone 's all messed up again and i do n't know this city 
 can you give me directions to this place '' 
 unfortunately i had no idea where the place he wanted to get to was - there 's a ridiculous amount of restaurants around there no man knows them all 
 but at a glance i could tell the maps app was putting him several blocks away - a <unk> i was all too familiar with 
 & gt bytewave : i 'm sorry not familiar with the restaurant 
 but maybe i can help you with the phone that 's kind of my thing 
 there are n't that many reasons why maps would give you wrong <unk> 
 mind telling me what carrier you 're in business with when you got that nexus 5 whether or not you ever switched sim cards and how long ago you started having this kind of trouble '' 
 he looked at me a little puzzled for a second of course it 's unusual for strangers to try to troubleshoot your phone out on the street - but when i see a problem i can solve easily sometimes i just get into troubleshooting mode 
 it 's hard to leave a problem i can fix unattended 
 & gt stranger : eh at this point why not 
 i 'm with <unk> name i use in my tales for the telco i work at i got this <unk> soon after it was commercially available no switch of cards and this began a few months back 
 how will any of that help though 
 the antenna inside must just be broken i 'm planning to replace it soon '' 
 i smiled knowing i probably knew already what was wrong with it 
 & gt bytewave : i assure you i 'm going somewhere with this 
 is there any chance that you had to do a factory reset on that phone a few months back '' 
 & gt stranger : <unk> ... err.. yes 
 how would you.. '' & gt bytewave : settings wireless & amp networks more ... preferred network type it 'll be set as lte select 3g instead then do a power cycle 
 then maps will work fine and you 'll get where you need to go 
 later you should get your sim card switched to an lte one at any of their stores it 's free '' 
 this is a commonplace issue for us at the telco with nexus <unk> 
 when they launched much of our network was still 3g and we sold them with 3g sim cards 
 later we went <unk> lte but thing is if you do a factory reset on those and it <unk> our lte network on setup it 'll set it 's preferred network type to lte even though there 's a 3g sim inside 
 we replace those sims for lte ones without charge but most customers do n't know about any of this and end up with the wrong network preference 
 what happens when you select lte with a 3g sim in a <unk> phone 
 precisely what was happening to this guy 
 the phone still <unk> mostly but your location data will be all messed up causing severe issues with apps like maps 
 your location will show up as far as a <unk> away from where you really are 
 and there are other consequences such as delayed connectivity as you exit an elevator or a <unk> things like that 
 all it takes to fix it is either to switch to an lte sim or manually set it back to 3g 
 in one instance it 's even caused issues for our internal security department which turned out to be unable to execute a police warrant to track a phone properly 
 the <unk> issue network ticket about that has not been updated in over a year last entry just says 'on hold pending external input - aka google is n't in much of a hurry to help our engineering figure out whose fault it is 
 either way the stranger complied 
 & gt stranger : ... there 's no way 
 it shows the right place now 
 how 
 how could you just guess it just like that '' 
 & gt bytewave : my cab 's coming over there 
 you just stumbled on the right guy at the right time - happy to be able to help 
 have a good day '' 
 as i was walking towards the cab he ran after me reached for my left arm and <unk> a bunch of bills into my hand 
 turns out that <unk> you can actually get paid for random acts of tech support 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 a <unk> client of mine called me with an unusual problem his energy bill <unk> last month from $ 90 to $ 270 and the only new addition to his house is a $ 30 <unk> printer 
 i figured it 'd definitely be something trivial like heating as it 's been a very cold and wet winter here 
 i 've been called over for far simpler things in the past but thought i 'd pay him a visit as he 'd do the same for me if the roles were reversed 
 i arrive at the gentleman 's house and run over the obvious devices with high energy consumption : * space heater 
 nope client runs gas 
 * water heater 
 nope client runs gas 
 * clothing <unk> 
 yes twice a week for a few hours ~ $ 3 per week in energy costs * <unk> air-con 
 yes only twice this month for one hour at a time ~ $ 2 total cost * tv 
 yes but usage patterns match previous months 
 perplexed i reluctantly checked out the new printer as nothing else seems to have changed 
 there 's no way in hell a small ink-jet can account for such high power consumption without someone noticing excessive heat a smell or *something* the printer showed no obvious signs of <unk> it 's the standard <unk> <unk> hp mfc inkjet with a crappy printer glued to a <unk> scanner inside of which lies an insanely noisy belt drive 
 it printed normally and its power supply was cool to the touch 
 i suspected a mis-reading of the energy meter by the power company as we 're talking <unk> the previous months bill here 
 i had to be sure though as i 'd look like a complete ass to everyone if i 'm wrong 
 so out comes the trusty ac clamp-meter and i tell everyone not to turn anything on or off 
 i removed the screws to the client 's <unk> <unk> zero the clamp-meter attach it the main circuit breaker feed and wait for it to <unk> 
 for those unfamiliar with <unk> they allow you to fairly safely measure <unk> power consumption using something called the <unk> 
 the readings displayed are usually in amps but you can multiply the reading by the line voltage to get watts and <unk> watts by 1000 to get kilowatts you 're usually billed in kilo-watt hours which is how many kilowatts you <unk> per hour based on the client 's normal '' bills i <unk> his <unk> consumption at <unk> per hour which works out to a meter reading of <unk> 
 of course the reading will change depending on whether or not the fridge or other appliances are active but we 're just after a sanity check here 
 the meter reading finally <unk> ... and we 're at an idle reading of 5amps 
 so i break out the <unk> and run some figures : * i have an <unk> reading of 5 amps and a line voltage of 240volts australia * 5amps x 240volts = 1200 watts which is 1.2 kilowatts per hour * 1.2 kilowatts per hour x 24 hours in a day = <unk> kilowatts per day * <unk> kilowatts per day x <unk> days in july = 892.8 kilowatts * the client is charged at roughly 30 <unk> per kilo-watt hour so * 892.8 kilowatts used in july x $ <unk> per kilo-watt hour = ** $ <unk> 
 ** jesus christ 
 we 're pretty close to last months bill it 's likely that there was n't a mis-reading <unk> 
 i ran through the house and verified active devices : one pc one 32 '' lcd tv one large fridge one bar fridge and a couple of small led <unk> 
 i have the same energy provider and much more running idle at home with half the idle consumption 
 something is seriously wrong here 
 with the clamp-meter still attached i turned off all the <unk> breakers 
 my idea was to turn the breakers on one by one until i find the circuit that draws an unusual amount of current 
 i start <unk> the breakers on one by one until they 're all on with nothing unusual reported by the meter 
 i get to the last breaker and i 'm still only at <unk> total current 
 i ensure all the devices that should be on are on and they are - except the fridges 
 they cycle on and off automatically as required 
 turning their power source off then on wo n't guarantee that their <unk> will restart immediately 
 so now i 'm feeling like a smug git thinking that it 's definitely one of the fridges that are at fault 
 so i sit there for a good twenty minutes waiting for the click '' of a fridge compressor 
 i hear two almost <unk> clicks as both the main and bar fridges power up pretty unusual and almost trip over myself running outside to get a current reading 
 ... it 's <unk> 
 one point six 
 the fridges are fine everything 's back to normal 
 what the hell happened to the five amps i was getting before 
 try as i might i could not get the fault to <unk> 
 <unk> i tell the client that there *was* a fault somewhere but it disappeared when i reset the breakers 
 he thanked me and said some words of encouragement that i ca n't remember as i was too busy <unk> in pool of shame and utter defeat 
 i did n't even charge him for my time 
 i left his house and went back to work but secretly hoped that the issue would return and that he 'd call me 
 a month passes and i get a phone call from the client 
 i had the biggest shit-eating grin on my face man 
 i knew what the call was going to be about and i started making my way over to his house as soon as i saw his name pop-up on my phone i did n't even answer yet 
 his energy bill was still high but it dropped from $ 270 to ~ $ <unk> 
 i immediately broke out my clamp meter and got to work 
 lo and behold the current consumption was almost the same as last time <unk> we 'll call it a <unk> measurement <unk> i really did n't want to reset the breakers this time as i 'd risk the problem disappearing again 
 i also could n't fit my clamp-meter around the wires of the <unk> breakers to test them one at a time 
 this left me only one choice : i had to remove and test every actively used power point in the house hoping that the problem is n't inside the roof cavity or <unk> 
 i started with all the major appliances 
 first i <unk> the appliance 's power-point from the wall then i placed the clamp-meter around the hot '' line and recorded the current measurement 
 i did this for the tv fridges microwave pc air-con mobile phone charger <unk> oven even the new bloody printer 
 i added all the current <unk> and so far the consumption is normal there 's still three amps being drawn by *something <unk> 
 i take a break and have a coffee with the client who asks me how things are going 
 i explained that the fault still exists somewhere and that there 's an electrical leak '' that i 'm trying to find but it 's likely in the roof or <unk> 
 for some reason the topic then turned to his new ink-jet printer on how he did n't expect the replacement ink cartridges to be so expensive 
 i explained that laser printers are generally cheaper in the <unk> and that the <unk> cost of the toner just <unk> more expensive 
 he told me that he actually has a networked laser printer for everyone in the house to use samsung <unk> mfc but it was more convenient for him to use his locally attached ink-jet printer 
 in fact he has n't touched the laser printer a couple of months and that sometimes he gets a pop-up complaining that it 's out of paper when he accidentally prints to it 
 ... so this printer is it plugged in *now* '' 
 - sure is 
 can i see it '' 
 - sure can 
 there is no way i missed this printer 
 even if i did it 's a <unk> printer i mean how the 
 surely it 's not the problem 
 surely 
 it 's kept inside a stationary cupboard near the living room with it 's own power-point behind the cupboard 
 first thing i notice is a funny smell <unk> of hot plastic 
 the top of the printer is hot to the touch and it 's lcd screen is asking someone to load some paper into it 
 i undo the power point attach my clamp meter and sure enough i measure over 3 amps while the printer is doing nothing but waiting 
 i am in utter disbelief 
 i figure the fuser unit is stuck on '' so it 's keeping itself warmed up to <unk> printing when the page is finally loaded 
 i load a few pages into the printer and it runs through its list of queued jobs 
 when it 's finally completed the fuser turns off and the power consumption drops to nearly zero 
 i check the switchboard outside again and lo and behold we 're back down to sane readings 
 i thought back to when i last visited and realised that i must have cleared the printer queue when i <unk> all the power off and on again which is why the current consumption became normal 
 later on in the month the client must 've tried to print to the printer again causing it to turn on it 's fuser and wait for paper to be loaded 
 i 'm still in disbelief 
 of course this is dangerous behaviour for a printer so i 've reached out to samsung for comment ... i guess i 'll wait to see if i receive a call next month **tl dr** client 's energy bill <unk> 
 only new addition to the house is a cheap inkjet printer 
 suspected many different major appliances all check out fine 
 turns out clients old laser printer has been out of paper for two months and its heater fuser was stuck on '' while waiting for replacement paper drawing <unk> per month on its <unk> had just left the <unk> 's for my <unk> <unk>

 few years back my team was migrating about 250 users to a new build 
 in <unk> we 'd asked each users to label all their computer <unk> so the <unk> would know which offices to move stuff to 
 the night before the move i did a <unk> and found this note attached to one of the screens 
 & gt it please do n't forget to setup google at the new office 
 i ca n't do my job without it 
 i added a small message in reply & gt i will personally see to it that google '' is there 
 afterward i got a email from the user thanking me for looking out 
 i work at a nuclear generation station i 'll keep it generic with a staff of roughly 800 people 
 a ticket came in stating that the wifi was not working in one of the shops 
 so it heads down to the shop to find that the wifi is indeed not active down there 
 upon inspecting the wireless gateway we find that it has been unplugged 
 the gateway is mounted to the ceiling 
 someone had to climb up into the ceiling tiles and unplug it 
 which is exactly what happened 
 the same guy that put in the ticket about the wifi not working climbed up there and unplugged it because he <unk> n't want that thing giving me cancer 
 he was under the impression that because it was mounted right above his desk that it shot a focused wireless beam right down on to him and was going to give him cancer 
 after explaining that it does n't shoot beams at people we asked him if he uses a cell phone which you hold right up to your head and he <unk> in the affirmative 
 we also pointed out that he works at a nuclear facility and is worried about getting cancer from a wireless <unk> while at work my fellow tech support agent threatened me with a remote wipe on my computer 
 so i shouted chatted do it '' and forgot about it 
 five minutes later our dba comes into my office and starts wiping down my monitor and desktop with a tissue 
 he looks at me and says remote wipe complete '' and walks away 
 edit : oh wow 
 thanks for the gold as some of you have noticed i’m female 
 i don’t usually catch flak for it despite having a very mechanical job and when i do it’s usually from other women which just <unk> me to no end 
 i think sewing is such <unk> woman thing to do despite the fact that probably 25 % of my customers are men that a woman working on sewing machines just doesn’t raise eyebrows 
 but every once in awhile there’s that guy 
 this time it was mr brown 
 mrs brown called her machine was having some electrical problems she thought <unk> up and <unk> her husband had been unable to fix it could i take a look at it 
 an appointment was made for her to bring it in 
 whenever i hear those magic words i cringe 
 just like with the <unk> etc if the husband couldn’t fix it that generally means i have to undo whatever he did figure out the real problem and then fix it 
 when those words get used i charge by the hour not the job 
 the next day mrs brown a <unk> old lady with a cane turned up at the door 
 mr brown was right behind her carrying the machine 
 mrs brown’s machine had a knee controller 
 the difference between a knee controller and a foot controller is strictly down to user preference 
 you like what you like and don’t usually like the other one but there’s no difference <unk> 
 mrs brown had had <unk> as a child and had <unk> on both <unk> and didn’t have the physical ability to use a foot controller but did just fine with the knee controller 
 then she told me not to plug it in until after i’d looked the controller 
 ok why not 
 apparently mr brown’s fix had created enough of an electrical arc that she’d been knocked out of her chair when she’d tried to use it and it had tripped the breaker and <unk> the outlet 
 so i opened the knee controller and there were <unk> burns everywhere 
 i don’t know what mr brown had done beside the obvious crossing of something he shouldn’t have but he had gone back and <unk> everything apparently without mrs brown’s knowledge 
 i plugged it <unk> 
 mr brown had killed it 
 in the meantime in the background mr brown is making nearly continuous comments about my gender and likely ability to fix anything let alone anything as complicated as electricity and what i should instead be <unk> anything at home having to do with dishes laundry and kids 
 mrs brown is shooting him increasingly <unk> glares and finally after a comment about “how is she supposed to fix it when i couldn’t 
 she can’t know what she’s doing ” mrs brown turned around <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> with her cane and told him it was his fault they were there at all and that he should go wait in the <unk> been quite enough help already thank you 
 the expression on his face was comical but he left 
 i had a spare knee controller and offered to sell it to her 
 she agreed and i checked her machine in for whatever its original issue had been 
 when i called her three days later to tell her it was done she told me she’d come get it in a week 
 “he’s going to hear about this for awhile 
 silly man *always* thinks he knows better than anyone else and this time could have been bad 
 i still have <unk> from falling out of the <unk> not young you <unk> the electrician is coming tomorrow to check the wiring and replace the outlet in my sewing room 
 you just hang on to it for a bit dear and when his ears are good and burnt off we’ll come get it.” a week later they came back 
 mrs brown insisted i go into great detail about what was wrong with it brushes worn into nothingness carbon dust everywhere and how i’d fixed it new brushes thorough cleaning mostly i think to demonstrate to mr brown that i did know what i was doing 
 mr brown said nothing just waited by the door 
 i don’t care if you’re friendly or <unk> is fine 
 but if you can’t be that at least be civil 
 or <unk> works for me 
 good cooks believe in the concept of mise en place '' - having every ingredient and tool out and ready before you start cooking 
 that way you wo n't be caught burning your food while scrambling to find something that was missed 
 that concept also applies to other areas of expertise such as today 's story 
 recently i had to take over support of an application due to the regular support guy going on vacation 
 no big deal 
 i get a request from the application 's development team asking me to provision database role x for them which they need for testing 
 no problem 
 i gladly write up the request and send it on its merry way 
 it takes a day to process and provision 
 but throughout the day the dev team is <unk> me asking for the status 
 once i submit the thing it 's out of my hands so i do n't have much to tell them 
 the next day i get invited to a meeting including the project manager who goes into a big wasteful lecture on how they are now a day behind and why is this late and what can we do to prevent further delays 
 securing this database role is something the project manager could have had taken care of weeks ago but due to lack of <unk> is suddenly needed immediately 
 the old saying about lack of planning and emergencies pops into my head as i <unk> suggest that they get me a list of everything that they need set up so i can send all the requests in one batch 
 the pm then says i do n't have the details ask the dev team '' 
 the dev team says database role x was all they needed 
 meeting <unk> 
 i go about my day 
 so now the dev team has their shiny new database role x and are testing out their code 
 but there 's a problem - their stuff is failing 
 after they spend some time figuring out why the dev team comes back to me and says they also need me to request database roles y and <unk> as soon as possible 
 and what 's the status of the request now 
 how about now 
 are we there yet 
 yo project manager 
 i found your problem 
 you and your dev team ai n't got your mise en place 
 tl dr : my <unk> is burning 
 quick 
 <unk> me some pot <unk> 
 **me : ** good morning sir just a quick call about the phone you 've sent in for repair 
 the problem is that it 's using too much data 
 **customer : ** yes i got a huge bill so they told me to send it for repair 
 theres no way i used as much as i was charged for 
 **me : ** <unk> you see this is n't really the sort of thing that *can* be caused by your phone going faulty ... did you check your phones data usage in the settings 
 it 's showing that youtube has been used lots on the phone almost 9gb over the last month 
 do you use that app much 
 **customer : ** no 
 i 've never even been on that app 
 **me : ** sir is there anybody <unk> from you who uses the phone 
 children maybe 
 **customer : ** no my kids are good 
 they do n't run me bill up like this 
 ca n't you see what 's caused this 
 **me : ** ok ... the phone can give me quite a detailed overview of how it 's been used 
 it 's shown youtube has used 9gb in the <unk> 
 that means it 's been used when the screen has been on and you 've been looking at that app ... **customer : ** that 's out of the question i never use youtube 
 **me : ** <unk> if i go into the youtube app i can view the search history and <unk> has been searching for <unk> pig <unk> <unk> and a whole load of other kids shows 
 now are you <unk> that your kids have n't been using the phone i work as senior tech support at a telco 
 not long ago i got a call from a manager at a department i rarely work with 
 recoveries the people who handle unpaid bills 
 & gt bytewave : senior line bytewave 
 you may send me your ticket '' 
 & gt recoveries : no can do i 'm recoveries 
 i mean from recoveries manager for the red team '' 
 that 's how they call the team that handles <unk> recoveries cases where there 's no chance we 're going to be getting a penny anymore from customers with a huge unpaid bill 
 typically most of their work is escalating files to credit rating agencies to ensure there 's some consequence for bad faith non-payment 
 & gt bytewave : how may i help bring the full wrath of $ telco on our non-paying customers today '' 
 & gt recoveries : i have a dossier on a customer that has consistently avoided payment or contact with us 
 she has been disconnected a couple weeks ago 
 sending you the account number via internal chat 
 soon after our staff got info from the <unk> tool that her modem was still heavily using the network 
 internal security even sent them notices for possible piracy 
 so i figured there had to be something wrong with our disconnect command and sent it up to networks 
 they said the disconnect was successful on her mac and that they disabled the tap on the pmd just to be sure - pasted the ticket 
 but the heavy data usage was still ongoing so we sent a road tech to physically disconnect the drop from the pmd 
 they did 
 but she found a way and is still abusing our service without paying 
 i 've been asked to double-check with tech support first but if you ca n't shut this modem down now we 're going to call the cops have them get a warrant and physically remove the modem from the premises '' 
 ... i let all that sink in with a deep breath 
 there 's no way to somehow keep a modem online once it 's mac has been blacklisted via our software and the notion that work orders had been issued to physically disconnect the drop regardless was hilarious 
 but that even after the drop was cut they were thinking about calling law enforcement because they were still seeing data usage ... i had few words 
 it took a few seconds to regain composure 
 & gt recoveries : hello 
 can you help 
 any way to really kill this modem or do we need cops '' 
 & gt bytewave : i can help 
 according to our tools there are four drops going out of this pmd with only tap3 servicing the potential you 're looking at 
 according to our files there is only one device in there a modem $ <unk> but ... '' & gt recoveries : yes 
 like i said 
 one device that somehow ca n't be disabled remotely or physically '' 
 & gt bytewave : if you 'd let me finish 
 tap3 was disabled via software 6 days ago and the drop on tap3 was physically removed 3 days ago - but the modem you 're looking at stayed online and has recorded heavy network usage especially <unk> ever since 
 obviously that 's impossible given the line was disconnected at both software and hardware levels 
 the live tools confirm that there 's nothing physically connected to tap 3 right now '' 
 & gt recoveries : ... okay so how did she <unk> it past our systems '' 
 oh ffs ... & gt bytewave : there 's nothing physically connected to our network on that tap 
 and if there was it would be offline because networks shut it down remotely 
 the obvious conclusion is that you 're looking at readings and history logs from the wrong modem '' 
 long silence 
 & gt recoveries : but it 's in the file 
 the billing system would have never allowed this ... & gt bytewave : .. unless the mac you 're looking at is legitimately <unk> elsewhere in the node 
 which it is - all we needed to do is to run a simple search 
 the mac you 're looking at is physically as far removed as possible while being in the same node - and the actual modem of the non-paying customer is <unk> offline - has been disconnected for some time before it even got to the red team 
 the billing system is full of holes you guys know that right 
 why is this the first time anyone at tech support heard about this - there 's no prior tickets 
 the guys at networks will blacklist any mac they 're told to and have no time to investigate 
 we 're the ones who should be called first per the procedure to look into this kind of issue before we involve them ... '' & gt recoveries : how is this possible 
 it 's in another file and it still works '' 
 & gt bytewave : yes 
 and if you look at that file which i just im 'd you 
 you 'll see the paying customer who actually has this modem has been complaining about <unk> for ... a couple weeks 
 we 'll need to issue a full credit there 
 and if you look at the file history you can figure out in eight seconds they used to live together 
 we sent a road tech out to replace his modem because nobody could figure out that there 's a recoveries block there <unk> we were never contacted despite <unk> 
 this is both a perfect example of why our outdated billing and provisioning systems need to be updated and why <unk> policies should ... '' & gt recoveries : but 
 what about the lady not paying 
 can we cut her service or not '' 
 ... i gave up 
 obviously her service had been cut since they asked networks to shut down the pmd 's tap3 
 when we sent a guy to disconnect the drop physically we were obviously wasting our time it had been out for three days 
 how is that even something i still need to explain 
 & gt bytewave : .. tsss hereby <unk> on record that there is no possible way that service currently functions at the address of this non-paying customer 
 the tap has been shut down by networks and the physical cable is disconnected i have double confirmation - logs and tickets 
 no contact with law enforcement needed 
 your job is done close the file '' 
 & gt recoveries : oh 
 well then 
 okay gon na close it 
 this would be simpler if the system was a bit more intuitive '' 
 yes it would ... this would also have been simpler given a touch of common sense 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 so i 'm not the best <unk> but this happened last week 
 i support all our organization 's human resources and payroll applications and for some reason the cafeteria credit card machines fall under <unk> so naturally i have to troubleshoot four touch screen network machines that ring up <unk> sandwiches from time to time 
 last week we get a call from the <unk> of employee food services and she is frantic 
 she tell us that the entire system is down and no one can use the <unk> machines '' 
 we ask her to reboot the machines and she told us that she already tried that and everyone he is trying to eat and if you do n't hurry everyone is going to starve '' 
 okay 
 so we call the network guys and they assure is that the application is live on the network and is responding 
 we go down to check the hardware and everything works except right when you press the <unk> button 
 we try using a mouse we try different ethernet cables we check the permissions for the machines 
 nothing 
 at & amp t services our network so we ask them to come down and take a look 
 they are outside the building on the roof under the building making sure that everything is wired correctly 
 we ca n't figure it out 
 we have multiple meetings with different it managers trying to troubleshoot this system 
 one meeting in particular is pushing three hours to come up with a solution for the rest of week card readers and pen and paper when the phone rings 
 its the supervisor from the cafeteria hey sorry for the trouble 
 we figured it out '' 
 *long silence* we forgot to pay the application license bill this month 
 this phone call actually took <unk> minutes to determine what she was trying to do and what she was looking at 
 this is the abbreviated version 
 one magical day i was the lucky recipient to answer this helpdesk call while working on this particular campus 
 *i set my beloved coffee down to answer the phone* & gt client : hello 
 i need some help the email server is down 
 & gt me : one second let me check on that 
 <unk> never said anything about it being down ... <unk> <unk> & gt me : well it looks okay from here and i just ran some tests against it 
 what exactly seems to be the problem 
 & gt client : well i ca n't open my email program 
 outlook i think it 's called 
 & gt me : oh okay 
 do you get an error message when you click on it 
 & gt client : well it 's not even there the icon is gone 
 & gt me : alright no problem 
 let 's get it back on your desktop from your start menu 
 & gt client : is that the button in the corner 
 it looks like that is gone too 
 <unk> me i 'm going in* & gt me : okay let me try to remote in 
 what 's your asset tag number 
 & gt client : xxxxx & gt me : i ca n't get in can you make sure your network is connected 
 there should be an icon that shows the <unk> in the tray by the clock 
 & gt client : my screen is black i ca n't see it 
 ... her screen is n't on 
 wait is the computer on 
 & gt me : can i have you check to see if your tower is turned on 
 do you see a green light 
 & gt client : no its not how it normally looks 
 i think it 's supposed to be green or blue 
 the round turn on button is n't working 
 & gt me : i know you guys have tight desks over there can you make sure it 's plugged in to the wall 
 & gt client : hold on a second let me get a flashlight it 's really dark under my desk 
 <unk> noises* & gt client : ugh it 's so dark in here when the power is <unk> brain is still recovering from this call i got about 30 minutes ago 
 i do contract it 
 a customer called to have a new user set up for e-mail on their phone 
 i configure the account and e-mail the credentials to their boss with some brief setup instructions 
 about 30 minutes later i get a call from the customer explaining that the new employee is attempting to get e-mail working 
 they 've already looked at what 's on the screen and everything appears correct to them 
 they 're using the correct e-mail protocol 
 so now we move on to the password and the customer passes the phone to the new employee 
 oh hi yeah i 've tried to do this damn thing about 10 times and it just wo n't work 
 is there any way we can change my password to something shorter 
 when he showed it to me i was like <unk> that 's a long password '' 
 i usually set a <unk> character random alphanumeric mixed case password so i 'm used to getting complaints but it 's just temporary 
 they can pick what they want after initial setup and i never have to know how terrible of a password they chose 
 so after having them <unk> the password very slowly 3 times and verifying it works from webmail i start reading off <unk> what the password should be making sure letters are <unk> where necessary 
 we get to the end ... that 's it 
 what about the rest '' 
 that 's the whole password what do you mean '' 
 well i 've got more here there 's a space then a bracket thing and then a lowercase c a s ... '' at this point i realize what 's happening 
 after the password i wrote case sensitive so they 'd know that it matters 
 for some bizarre reason this guy has no idea what this means and has been typing case sensitive at the end of his password the whole time 
 after correcting that <unk> error i 'm happy to say his e-mail is now working on his <unk> have a story i wanted to share about a data security breach at a large corporation 
 one particular executive had a malware infection on his computer from which the source could not be determined 
 the <unk> system was patched up to date had antivirus and up to date <unk> protection 
 web logs were <unk> and all attempts made to identify the source of the infection but to no avail 
 finally after all traditional means of infection were covered it started looking into other possibilities 
 they finally asked the executive <unk> there been any changes in your life <unk> 
 the executive answer “well yes i quit smoking two weeks ago and switched to <unk> 
 and that was the answer they were looking for the made in china <unk> had malware hard coded into the charger and when plugged into a computer’s usb port the malware phoned home and infected the system 
 moral of the story is have you ever question the <unk> of the $ 5 dollar ebay made in china usb item that you just plugged into your computer 
 because you should you damn well should 
 sincerely an it <unk> for a mid-sized law firm with ~20 lawyers most of which are average with technology at best 
 i had to install google earth for an insurance lawyer so that he could view the <unk> of a car accident 
 after showing him the basics of it he continues on his way and i do n't hear from him 
 later on as i 'm walking past his office i notice he still has earth open hours later but this time he is starring at a blank piece of land 
 he is also on the phone with a worried look on his face 
 he waves me inside and asks me why his house is n't on google earth 
 is it gone 
 i 'm on the phone with my wife right now who is on her way home to make sure there has n't been an explosion and our home is gone he says 
 his house was built in the last year in a very rural area of our city 
 after explaining that the images he is seeing are not in real time and are in fact likely a year or more old he calms down and continues <unk> tfts

 i should have known better 
 i will be me customer will be cx

 insert qa points here including getting information for the account okay i 'm showing that your service has been disconnected due to non-payment with a past due amount of $ <unk> more than $ 800 
 would you like to be transferred to billing to get this fixed '' 
 it was at this point i believe i heard a bomb go off on the phone as the customer starts screaming 
 & gt cx : past due amount 
 i ai n't never got no bill from you guys '' 
 i see that she gets emailed bills so i 'm inclined to ask & gt me : well ma'am are you not receiving the bills to your email '' 
 & gt cx : yes but i am not paying it until you send me a paper bill 
 that 's the law '' 
 it turns out the customer had not paid her bill in <unk> <unk> because she thought she did n't have to pay emailed bills

 *edit : wtf <unk> tl dr what the professional told me cant possibly work 
 oh look it worked 
 the phrase digging themselves a deeper hole '' comes to mind with this story 
 there was no subtly here no <unk> tricks just ... pure stupidity <unk> and nonsense from a client 
 the story <unk> features mma previously featured here a badass girl in her mid 20 's who is an <unk> fighter 
 she now works the front desk here at $ deepsouthit 
 & amp nbsp at $ deepsouthit we have three divisions 
 voip isp and it services 
 i work for it services and mma handles all of it services incoming calls and scheduling 
 she also unofficially acts as our t1 support by virtue of her listening carefully when we explain a problem and while she has no desire to continue into the it field has taken the time to let us teach her a lot of stuff we have to deal with so that she can save us time rather than just pushing a call back to our department 
 i say this purely to show that i have confidence in mma 's diagnostic capabilities 
 if she ca n't fix it over the phone it 's not a basic problem 
 & amp nbsp one issue we run into a lot is that our isp side and it services side gets mixed up a lot ... we have it spelled out on our website exactly what each department does 
 isp has free support for internet related things and generally you only pay for the service and any local networking equipment such as your router though we are willing to provide one manage it and support it for an additional small fee 
 it by comparison is a contracted or hourly service 
 if you do n't have a monthly contract with us it 's $ <unk> per hour of service and it is quite a bit of money 
 people confuse this and get offended that we want to charge them for what they think is an internet issue but is actually an it issue 
 & amp nbsp in this particular case we had $ <unk> call in 
 they are a fairly well known client of ours 
 we provide internet to their building as well as their it services 
 since they do not call us very often they opted to just do our hourly rates whenever we were needed as opposed to a maintenance contract 
 normally we deal with nicedirector a middle aged lady whom is at a level with technology that she is our designated power user on site 
 this week nicedirector was out on vacation taking advantage of the holiday 
 instead we had harpy call in 
 harpy actively tried to avoid us being one of the ones to insist that whatever systems they had before we arrived pen and paper were just fine for their needs 
 as an aside nicedirector and harpy are both equal rank in the company and are both directly under the owner in terms of what power they <unk> 
 & amp nbsp harpy called in towards the 9th hour of the day mma had just prepared her tea and was at that point where her normally <unk> attitude was fully <unk> up and ready to roll 
 harpy threw a stick in that engine real quick ... i did n't get the first part of the conversation but overhearing mma from down the hall it sounded like there were a lot of accusations being thrown 
 she later told me that she had been questioning the quality of service they were receiving 
 for situations like this in which one of our front desk workers may need help but not necessarily taking over the call we have an im client that is all linked together 
 i ping her on it and let her know i 'm about to conference into the call with my phone muted to listen in in case she needed help 
 she thanked me and the conversation went more or less as follows 
 & amp nbsp from this point forward anything in bold is between myself and mma on our im client 
 normal text is over the phone 
 & gt harpy : i just do n't understand why you people ca n't keep our connection stable every computer in this office has been disconnecting randomly all morning '' 
 **me : ask her if this has been interrupting their connection to their medical program 
 ** & gt mma : ma'am have you been losing connection to your medical program as well as the internet 
 i have a note here saying that you have a medical database program hosted on one of your local servers '' 
 & gt harpy : yeah whenever we get into the program it kicks us out after a few minutes saying there is an address problem and that the server does n't exist 
 that means we ca n't get out to it '' 
 & gt mma : no ma'am that server with the program and database are in your building we installed it 
 if it was a problem with the internet you would still be able to access the program '' 
 **mma : just im 'd <unk> and he says the link to their building could n't be any better 
 something else is up 
 ** & gt mma : ma'am have y'all done anything today to your network such as add a new device or ... '' & gt harpy : of course not 
 all we did was add a couple of wireless routers to help put wifi to the rest of the building '' 
 **mma : sends me an <unk> with an eye twitch going on 
 ** & gt mma : ma'am you said a <unk> of wireless routers '' 
 & gt harpy : five '' 
 & gt mma : ok so you put five wireless routers throughout the building ... that is more than likely what the problem is '' 
 & gt harpy : explain 
 my brother works in it and has a setup like this at his workplace so it should just work '' 
 **me : we quoted them for a set of <unk> dishes to give them wifi throughout the entire building and she declined it 
 ** **mma : f @ # $ ing figures 
 ** & gt mma : well ma'am your brother more than likely configured them to work together like they are 
 they can do that but out of the box they have settings enabled that fight one another '' 
 & gt harpy : well that 's stupid what setting is this why have n't i heard of it before on my home router or something '' 
 & gt mma : it 's something called dhcp it hands out ip addresses over the network to various devices so <unk> '' & gt harpy : put it in a way i 'll understand it i do n't speak tech '' 
 **me : <unk> <unk> '' ** & gt mma : ok think of it this way ... your network is a street in the big city of internet 
 your street name is the same as your building 's ip address 
 on that street there are buildings with numbers 
 dhcp decides which number house that is 
 data is like the mailman bringing you your letters 
 when you have more than one router on the network doing dhcp it is like a group of people going around the street and changing the building numbers over and over again ... the mailman does n't know where to go '' 
 **me : good analogy 
 ** & gt harpy : well the mailman is f***ing stupid '' 
 & gt mma : ... i 'm sorry '' 
 & gt harpy : if the mailman does n't know what god damned building he 's going to then he 's a pretty piss poor mailman and i 'd have fired him '' 
 & gt mma : that 's ... not ... what i meant ... look bottom line is either those routers get unplugged or you pay for a tech to come out there and and configure the routers to not fight each other 
 **mma : <unk> '' ** & gt harpy : let me speak to your manager or someone who knows what the hell they 're doing 
 we 're not paying a thing when it 's your internet that 's messed up '' 
 & gt mma : whatever you say ma'am ... '' **mma : you want this or should i pass this onto boss 
 ** **me : go ahead and pass her to me if need be i 'll elevate it to boss 
 ** & gt me : after seeing mma mute herself i <unk> myself and take over this is cyrillus how can i help you '' 
 & gt harpy : she proceeds to explain that mma was no help at all and that she needed this problem resolved 
 i take a moment to finish a trouble ticket i had been closing out instead & gt me : alright ma'am i have her notes here 
 it says you added five wireless routers unconfigured to your network '' 
 & gt harpy : well i mean they 're configured we can get on the wireless ... it just does n't work '' 
 & gt me : she also notes that she explained that dhcp should only be handled by one device on the network that device being your dhcp server in your network room '' 
 & gt harpy : oh not this bullshit again look are you a tech '' 
 & gt me : i am part of the it team yes '' 
 & gt harpy : oh ... well ... is there anyone above you i can speak with '' 
 & gt me : i can pass you on to boss but he 'll tell you the exact same thing 
 your routers are fighting one another and they need to either have dhcp disabled or disconnected from the network '' 
 & gt harpy : that is n't what i want to hear put me through to boss '' 
 i transfer her and go about my day ... & amp nbsp two hours later boss sent me a forwarded email along with mma 
 on the email it explained spoke with her for an hour she got abusive and i disconnected their internet service 
 owner called in i showed him the call recordings then got this a few minutes later '' 
 it was an email from owner requesting harpy 's ad account to be disabled and for a manager who was previously under her to be given the elevated privileges on the network that were normally reserved for harpy owner and nicedirector 
 an hour later there was another email forwarded to me 
 harpy 's replacement and owner had approved of our <unk> quote and i am now in the process of organizing getting it set up 
 & amp nbsp i love happy <unk> a bit of fluff for a chuckle : i get in the earliest i get an hour or so before most staff are in even the helpdesk so the occasional call filters through 
 so i get one this morning before i even normally get in and it 's from a remote depot user : **depot user : ** oh <unk> the whole erp system is down how long do you think before it 's back up '' 
 **me : ** i do n't think it 's down i 've receive no alerts how many people are reporting that there is a drama '' 
 **depot user : ** everyone is down no one can log in '' **me : ** shit right how many users are there at the moment '' **depot user : ** well it 's just me at the moment ... '' *sigh* <unk> all users are down 1 of 1 is still 100 % 
 ha ha turned out to be a password change she had ignored all <unk> i posted a while back that manglement has had a way of listening to the wrong people until things go horribly wrong then they have a 'information gathering meeting & lt -- <unk> to hide facts 
 so i have been begging for cooling in a server closet for years 
 i keep getting everything but what i asked for 
 each time we pay someone to come and do something or make some workaround 
 but in the end when the door is shut or uhm summer comes the proverbial shit hits the fan 
 this year finished it 
 the servers all died 
 came in and equipment had fried 
 i had people <unk> and running around asking what could be done 
 could we replace them 
 what how who why 
 i went out and surveyed the damage 
 systems fried and we would be <unk> from stored parts 
 good times and completely <unk> 
 i remind manglement that we need cooling 
 i point out the amount of money lost and projects now delayed because of this 
 no one actually paid attention 
 they just wandered around asking what else could be done 
 someone not in it suggested moving the equipment from that hot closet '' to a storage room 
 ding ding ding 
 we have a <unk> 
 so instead of simply putting cooling in the server closet 
 we will <unk> the building as we need outlets for power <unk> the network panels needed for the room move the equipment alarm the storage room along with adding door locks and hey are those <unk> to the outside right there 
 yeah ... so instead of simply putting in cooling ... we went with the <unk> manglement option 
 im still wondering what the hell just happened ... <unk> i got promoted to tech support 's senior staff many years ago i was given a 1-on-1 class for the new job 
 i was a little surprised because i had been told there were no classes - those who pass the tough exams are deemed already qualified as far as the telco is concerned 
 the class was scheduled as 'special training senior staff 
 stephan one of the old <unk> sometimes featured in my tales was the <unk> 
 & gt stephan : okay no boring <unk> for this one 
 this class is basically where we tell new tsss hires about the things we 've been lying to you about since you started working here '' 
 he paused a few seconds for dramatic effect but i knew some things are <unk> on purpose so i was n't too surprised 
 after explaining the <unk> rules he started with rather benign material like <unk> phone numbers or <unk> locations where we operate 
 once we got to the tech parts it got more interesting - learned the true reasons behind the worse flaws in our tools and how to work around them 
 learned about security flaws left live on purpose on the internal network because too many people needed them to work around bugs that there was no budget to fix properly 
 about <unk> with <unk> scripts that they used to get admin on their workstations whenever required 
 minor stuff like that 
 : p but he really kept the best for the end 
 the last portion were things that actually could impact customers about which we were expected to lie not only to them but to most internal employees too 
 it 's one thing to have secrets about our own systems but maybe another to systematically hand down bs answers *as directed by <unk> to a customer 's queries about our service 
 this was the worst one ... & gt stephan : okay now the password system for email and customers accounts on the website 
 ever gotten calls when working frontline from customers complaining being able to access either despite being sure they typed in the wrong password '' 
 & gt bytewave : nope 
 guy next to me got one a few months ago i believe but it could n't be <unk> easily 
 he was n't sure exactly why 
 tsss said the password was fine and there was no anomaly '' 
 & gt stephan : that 's the typical confusion that let 's us get away with the worst password system in the <unk> 
 the entire system is <unk> for replacement in 6 fiscal quarters so with a little luck <unk> it 'll actually happen sometime in the next 5 years '' 
 & gt bytewave : okay we advertise that it 's not case-sensitive - that 's not perfect but that 's still not an explanation for why customers would think they can log in if they noticed they made typos obviously 
 what 's the secret flaw '' 
 & gt stephan : <unk> 
 every character after the 8th is discarded and the system does not actually support special characters 
 it 's actually purely alphanumeric '' 
 & gt bytewave : but ... i have special characters in my own password ... '' he gave me a few seconds to think it over which i used to <unk> every call i overheard about this every bit of relevant hallway gossip 
 too many frontline techs getting too many weird calls about passwords not working like they should 
 at that moment i was torn between <unk> so it all makes sense and 'please tell me someone got fired for this 
 & gt bytewave : is the password system <unk> alternate keys for characters the system does n't actually support just to avoid admitting that our passwords are all weak '' 
 & gt stephan : first try <unk> 
 it started many years ago when the internet product director decided announcing <unk> that our passwords can only be alphanumeric non case-sensitive and 8 characters long could be damaging to our brand '' 
 previously featured in many of my tales the ipd is the closest thing i have to a personal <unk> 
 <unk> in plot <unk> despite his countless stupid decisions he remains not only employed but paid like a vice-president despite utterly screwing up one time out of three 
 previously featured in tales like this one or this one or this one ... & gt stephan : everyone is aware we 're not case-sensitive but what they do n't know is that every character past the 8th is ignored and most importantly that any special character defaults to a 0 which is unfortunately used as the <unk> '' 
 that 's when the extent of it hit me like a truck 
 if your password was 'q0w1 
 <unk> and you 'd type in <unk> you 'd get in just the same as if you typed in 'q0w1 / # # 
 in fact if your password was 
 / $ % & amp * you 'd get in typing <unk> 
 <unk> or a 8 <unk> limit was one thing 
 having all special characters default to an alphanumeric <unk> on both ends was absolutely insane 
 given our plaintext password offender status is well established stephan was able to use the moment during which i was <unk> to change a test account 's pw to 20 special characters and demonstrate the flaw by showing our internal system saw it as a string of 8 zeros only 
 the system could never know whether a customer legitimately put a 0 in their password or if it was in fact a special character that had defaulted to 0. for someone trying to log in of course special characters were also <unk> as zeros 
 & gt stephan : this is also part of why you can never ever tell a frontline tech any customer 's password 
 the whole thing would be exposed if they spelled it out to the customer for any reason - even though they should n't ever 
 obviously customers should n't know we do plaintext either '' 
 & gt bytewave : this is crazy 
 we 're all playing along with this 
 any customer who puts in a complex password is to be unaware what they believe makes their password secure actually <unk> it because the ipd decided it *could damage the brand* 
 and somewhere a customer is putting in a <unk> password unaware that only the first 8 digits count '' 
 & gt stephan : basically 
 it was signed off on as a temporary solution by systems *and* networks good while ago 
 timetables got busted happens a lot around here but it 'll change 
 in the meantime if this gets out bunch of people will get their email <unk> as we still do n't have a decent lockout solution 
 we 're playing along for now 
 you can complain about it in <unk> meetings or on <unk> lines with sysadmins - but not to lower management in general they were not deemed <unk> 
 moving right <unk> '' this entire time stephan looked like he was just letting me on a little <unk> <unk> 
 and that 's probably how i 'd tell it today too 
 experience in this job gets you <unk> real quick 
 as for the odd customer who occasionally called us about a typo apparently not preventing them from logging in they were often people with 9 or 10 <unk> long passwords - who noticed they <unk> the last letter or that kind of thing and still got in 
 while a handful of people might have guessed this much the crazy notion of special characters all <unk> to 0 somehow never got out of house 
 though it took about 3-4 years this horrible system did get replaced entirely 
 otherwise i would n't be posting this tale 
 though we 're still plaintext password offenders ... all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 part 1 part 2 i am testing my <unk> still not exactly sure why it works on the test site but not on the live site 
 and the phone rings ... i really hate the phone ringing 
 & gt me : hello the is it what can i help you with today 
 & gt hr : hey its hr can you come up to my office for a few minutes now 
 & gt me : need me to bring supervisor with me 
 & gt hr : no just yourself we 're ready and waiting 
 *click* * '' we 're waiting '' who is the other person that makes up the we 
 * i head up the hallway towards hr 's office hoping this is n't going to be something that gets out of control my control mostly 
 i knock on his door and i see him sitting behind his desk with buck sitting across from him 
 *my phone vibrates a quick <unk> & gt me : hey man i thought you were heading out of town for a wedding 
 & gt buck : oh i am later today i had something else to do this morning 
 & gt me : oh ok what 's this meeting about 
 & gt hr : an exit interview you need to do the equipment check in for him to sign 
 a millions thoughts were rushing through my mind and i did n't know what i could say in front of him 
 *my phone vibrates again* & gt me : um ok is the equipment here 
 & gt buck : it 's all in my office do we need to go over and do that now 
 & gt me : we can i need to print off a checklist and i 'll come back by shortly then we can go do the check in for the equipment 
 & gt buck : great i 'll be here i have some other stuff to sign and go over i think 
 & gt hr : yep quite a few things to go over and sign 
 i 'll give you a ring when he is free of the form storm i 'm going to hit him with now 
 i laugh at the <unk> storm comment wave goodbye then head back to my desk 
 i have to stop at supervisors door on my way 
 *my phone vibrates yet again* & gt me : bucks doing the exit interview ... & gt supervisor : really did you find something and i missed it 
 & gt me : no i think he got another job and just decided to cut the strings suddenly 
 & gt supervisor : guess devman got his way after all 
 heard anything from him 
 & gt me : not directly you getting an alert message from the firewall 
 *phone goes <unk> <unk> bzzz* he looks over at his email and <unk> down to a folder and frowns 
 & gt supervisor : yes content hits on a laptop it 's ... & gt me : <unk> right 
 & gt supervisor : yeah you got the messages too 
 & gt me : no but that 's the pc that i let developer manager take is it content hits 
 & gt supervisor : yes it 's only been four hits <unk> bzzz* five hits so far 
 mostly dating sites and gun sites nothing adult <unk> related 
 & gt me : kind of sucks that developer manager is going to try to drag this guy through the dirt 
 i wonder why he is doing this 
 & gt supervisor : i wonder if he was looking for something to screw the guys new job up at this point 
 odd for buck to suddenly be out of here think devman knew he was looking already and was trying to figure a way to screw his options 
 that had n't occurred to me and it made as much sense as anything else 
 & gt me : that is a good evil plan it 'd never work but i 'll be damned if the common <unk> would guess that 's whats happening 
 i hear my desk phone ringing i wave a quick <unk> to supervisor and rush over to my desk to grab the phone 
 & gt me : it guy here what do you need help with today 
 & gt hr : do you have like a random <unk> for these greetings 
 i take a moment to disable the phone notification for emails digital sticky note on my desktop to turn it back on later 
 & gt me : yep that 's what that last server was for it thinks for me i just read the words 
 the silence from the phone concerns me enough that i feel i must explain that it 's a joke 
 & gt me : that 's a joke i was asked to improve my greetings i accidentally answered the phone with a joke the other day and it upset someone 
 & gt hr : <unk> what was the joke 
 & gt me : um you wo n't think it 's funny but i answered the phone with have you tried turning it off and on again 
 and then when he said excuse me i said reboot the computer and call back 
 he hung up before i noticed it was n't who i was expecting ... & gt hr : yeah that 's not a good joke 
 anyways buck is ready to do the equipment check out 
 i tab over send his gear sheet to hr 's printer 
 & gt me : is your printer spitting out a piece of paper 
 & gt hr : why yes it is do you want me to do the check out 
 & gt me : no just figured it would save some time sending it to source 
 on my way up now 
 *** i 'm in buck 's office once more and he 's initially the lines as i verify the equipment he is returning 
 & gt me : so was this a sudden thing or you been heading out for a while 
 & gt buck : well it was sort of sudden but not as well 
 i was looking for work closer to pure development instead of database performance and documentation 
 and just between us a change of management 
 & gt me : change is good ... you have trouble with your management 
 mine seems ok for the most part 
 & gt buck : *laugh* you are a special case you walk around and management tries to agree with you 
 i 'm not sure what to say to that so i got back to checking everything off the list 
 he seems to agree that things are awkward and waits for me to point at a spot to initial 
 & gt buck : i did n't mean to insult you if you took that as an insult 
 but you do n't seem to be an employee most of the time it 's like you are here and everyone else works around you 
 & gt buck : do n't take me wrong something needs done you do it 
 i 've not seen anything except outstanding support from your department 
 but like yesterday you told a manager to be quiet and listen and he did ... i 'd never do that even if i was planning on quitting 
 & gt me : ok last line ... then sign here 
 as we were checking things off i had been loading most of it on a trolley cart 
 i stand up and offer him a hand to shake he grabs it and <unk> it firmly 
 & gt me : sorry i 'm not sure how to respond to what you said i guess i do tend to just roll over people on some things 
 do n't take my silence as being upset or offended by anything you said good luck with the travel wedding and new job 
 & gt buck : um do i leave now 
 & gt me : no you need to go back over to hr 's office i imagine you have to have a meeting with developer manager before actually leaving 
 & gt buck : no no i requested he not be involved 
 & gt me : ok well head back over there hr can get you signed out for the last time cut you a check for pay period and your remaining leave 
 he nodded and headed off down the hallway 
 i push the cart back to the cold room and head to my desk 
 i have 27 content alert emails and an email from developer manager about stopping by to look at something 
 i forward it to supervisor and then send him another message that buck 's equipment is in the cold room 
 then i head back to developer land ... devman 's door is closed when i get there so i knock i hear someone moving around inside and the door suddenly opens 
 developer manager looks both ways then waves me into his office 
 he has a desk lamp on and the over heard light is off 
 & gt me : can i turn the overhead light on this is a very uncomfortable situation for me 
 & gt devman : sure sure you know you did n't do a very good job with this internet history stuff 
 & gt me : what do you mean 
 & gt devman : well i found all this dating website stuff and there is a bunch of gun <unk> stuff 
 he 's also been looking at personal ads and not for <unk> <unk> 
 & gt me : really 
 show me i ca n't believe i missed something yesterday when i did the snoop 
 & gt devman : snoop 
 & gt me : sorry we call it a pc snoop inside our circle 
 & gt devman : oh ok look see last week he was on these sites and then he went here this week 
 & gt me : man i swear that was n't there yesterday i wonder how i missed it 
 & gt devman : it 's ok man we 're only human 
 *well one of us is ... * & gt me : yeah i guess i need to redo this but it will have to be on a new pc investigation form the other one was closed out already 
 he looks at me glares really i can tell he 's trying to give me cancer with his mind then he sighs 
 & gt devman : ok i 'll submit another form 
 can you do the investigation today 
 & gt me : sure as soon as i get the form can you get it submitted before i get back to my desk 
 & gt devman : sure i 'll do it now 
 he almost pushes the laptop into the floor getting to his keyboard 
 i watch him typing <unk> at his keyboard and then he looks up with a grin 
 & gt devman : there its submitted how long will it take 
 & gt me : a few hours schedule a meeting for 3 again 
 he nods and starts <unk> i turn towards the door 
 & gt devman : wait do n't you need this 
 & gt me : nope we have a copy of it back in our area setup already 
 & gt devman : oh right ok see you at three 
 i leave and i think he surely will demand i do the snoop on the laptop he 's been messing with this morning 
 i get around the first corner and <unk> my pace a little just knowing he is going to call out my name as he rushes down the hall with the laptop thrust out at me 
 i get around the second corner and i think i might be in the clear and hr grabs my arm suddenly from his doorway 
 & gt hr : hey why is there a new pc investigation form for a guy that does n't work here anymore 
 & gt me : developer manager request i take another look in light of what he found this morning 
 & gt hr : what did he find 
 & gt me : some <unk> activity was found on the cloned laptop i 'm going to take at it again to be helpful 
 i grin and head down the hallway as i turn the corner i see hr <unk> a head hung very low 
 i zoom past supervisors office and he <unk> out my name 
 & gt supervisor : hey troublemaker come back in here a minute 
 & gt me : whats up i 'm mid mischief at the moment 
 & gt supervisor : he submitted a request that we take a second look at that machine 
 what is that about 
 & gt me : hey did you run a report on the content filter 
 & gt supervisor : yes now ... .what ... are ... .you ... <unk> ... to ... 
 & gt me : just doing my job that 's what you pay me for right 
 & gt supervisor : you are going to give me grey hair or make me go bald ... i grin and wave as i head to my office i <unk> to the cold room to grab buck 's laptop then i get to my desk 
 i plug in the forensic thumb drive and run all my reports he has removed his dropbox and i do n't spend much time working on his file contents 
 to be honest i used some of the reports from yesterdays report 
 i think this one is primarily <unk> at someone else and the three pages of content filter report will be the <unk> of the meeting 
 i accept the meeting request and head to lunch when i get back i send an email to developer manager 
 i ask him if he found anything else and letting him know to bring the laptop to the meeting 
 i know he found something else because the content filter report is now four pages 
 right before the meeting i turn the notifications back on for emails on my phone 
 *** & gt hr : hello guys man this is some serious <unk> <unk> or what 
 i nod and offer up a weak grin supervisor looks at the floor an scratches his head developer manager is very <unk> and developer director appears to need a nap 
 *i could use a nap now that i think about it 
 * & gt me : yep seems pretty familiar here is a copy of the report of the pc investigation 
 i hand out four printed summary reports from the form i 've signed the bottom of each cover sheet swearing to its accuracy 
 devman instantly goes <unk> through the pages looking for something 
 & gt hr : well from the cover sheet summary you found nothing worthy of noting in the bad column so that <unk> this all up 
 meeting concluded 
 i grin at him he 's trying to prevent my mischief he tries to smile back at me 
 & gt devman : this is n't right none of the stuff i found is in this report 
 where is the dating and gun stuff 
 & gt me : i was unable to find anything related to dating or gun site traffic on buck 's laptop 
 developer director has nodded off at least he is n't <unk> 
 & gt devman : i showed it to you you saw it in my office 
 & gt me : you did show me something on the laptop in your office but i was unable to find it on buck 's laptop and the logs for his web activity to do show any non work related traffic 
 & gt devman : you did n't take his laptop you left it in my office you said you had another copy in your area 
 & gt me : yes we have the laptop that was assigned to buck he turned it in today 
 & gt devman : wait let me show you this stuff 
 i look at supervisor with a grin as devman opens the laptop and shows that it has indeed visited some dating sites in the past week 
 he 's animated enough about it that he <unk> developer director up from his afternoon nap 
 & gt director : what is this then 
 he <unk> in to look at the laptop he goes a little pale and then turns red in the face 
 he is a <unk> for internet access abuse in the office he has a <unk> when anyone mention <unk> <unk> 
 he looks across the table at me 
 & gt director : i thought you said you did n't find anything on his laptop 
 & gt me : i did n't find anything on buck 's laptop 
 & gt director : well this is a copy of his laptop right if it 's on this machine its on his machine right 
 you just overlooked this on his computer 
 & gt me : no sir none of this traffic exists on the equipment buck was assigned 
 director looks around then <unk> on hr 
 & gt director : buck has been processed out correct 
 & gt hr : yes he 's up in the break room waiting for a meeting with one of the vice <unk> before leaving 
 & gt devman : wait processed out is buck no longer an employee 
 why was n't i told 
 & gt hr : you were clocked out in a meeting your phone went to voice mail and buck requested you not be involved in the exit interview 
 i notified developer director and he said to go ahead and process him out 
 you should have an email about it from me i do n't know if you read it i 've not seen a read receipt yet 
 & gt devman : i was busy ... .with a meeting ... <unk> the phone ... he looked cornered without anyone in the room moving at all 
 he sounded <unk> but that made sense to me 
 & gt director : so why did this traffic not show on his laptop on in the content filter 
 & gt me : that traffic was n't generate until this morning to afternoon on that laptop 
 & gt director : how did buck get this laptop to visit those sites 
 & gt devman : buck did n't have this laptop it 's been in my office all morning 
 and now developer manager looks as if he 's swallowed a green <unk> 
 & gt director : wait you had this laptop all morning and this traffic magically appeared 
 & gt devman : the dates say the traffic was last week 
 i <unk> from the stares i receive from the others in the room it sounded as odd to them as it did to me 
 & gt me : well the dates on that laptop do say the traffic happened last week 
 but the report from the content filter say the traffic happened this morning and early afternoon 
 & gt director : how did buck do this 
 & gt hr : buck did n't do this i think it guy is saying that the traffic was generated by the person with the laptop this morning 
 & gt devman : then how does the stuff show up as being accessed last week 
 & gt me : you changed the system date on the laptop i bet you did n't change it back 
 i quickly spin it around and see that it 's 5 days short of the proper date 
 & gt me : yep today is not the <unk> ... hr stands and ends the original meeting is concluded and thanks us for attending 
 developer director is looking at his employee with less than a pleasing look 
 supervisor is slowly shaking his head and gathering his papers 
 *** a little after 5pm i am <unk> that i have a new email instantly followed by a second 
 the first email is letting the staff know that developer buck has chose to follow employment with another company 
 the second email is a request to report on the activity concerning the cloned laptop with a note to be sure to include my meeting record i know you recorded it - hr and the content filter report 
 i 'm also supposed to explain how the someone could create internet activity in the past 
 *** the following monday there are two messages sent out one is a notice about developer director is looking to interview people for a management position and the second is to disable access for developer manager 
 *** while i was logging saving the <unk> of developer manager i happened to find a im conversation where someone informed devman that buck was interviewing for a management position in development 
 i decide that devman decided that buck was after his job and wanted dirt to make him look less appealing 
 i found out that devman ended up working under buck at the other company a month or two later 
 i do n't know if buck was ever informed of the day before his last day or <unk> ftp you know the drill 
 while i do not work in tech support but build and run networks i could n't resist telling you this tale of my stupid colleague that happened just 10 minutes ago 
 $ dc is dumb colleague '' $ ic is <unk> colleague '' $ everyone is everyone else in the room i sit in 
 $ ic just got off the phone and this ensued : & gt ** $ ic** : guys do n't reboot your computers 
 & gt ** $ everyone** : why not 
 & gt ** $ ic** : the recent update for $ <unk> is highly buggy 
 if you reboot after its installation you wo n't be able to log on to your pc any more 
 & gt ** $ everyone** : oh ok that 's shit 
 better not reboot 
 & gt <unk> minutes <unk> & gt ** $ dc** : hm i ca n't log on to my computer 
 & gt ** $ ic** : what 
 did you reboot it 
 i just told you not to 
 & gt ** $ dc** : yeah 
 but i wanted to try it 
 & gt ** $ everyone** : why the hell would you want to try that 
 & gt ** $ dc** : well what else was i supposed to do 
 & gt ** $ everyone** : how about not reboot your computer '' 
 which now lead to him having to reinstall his machine 
 he 's just sitting there doing nothing <unk> this is still a story of tech support 
 changed many details to protect <unk> 
 i was working for a small it firm <unk> years ago and we had a branch of estate agents that operated a couple of towns away 
 they recently opened a new branch so i 'm there running cable setting up pc 's and servers the usual small it stuff 
 i 'm the first one there the boss opened up for me in order to get as much done before the staff arrived so bring on <unk> the staff begin entering 
 this is a small branch office only <unk> desks the usual small estate agency thing 
 in comes this young girl probably 19 or <unk> i was a single 23 year old at the time so of course i noticed her 
 obviously estate agencies hire good looking girls yes it 's <unk> but that 's the way of the world any edge a company needs to survive 
 so we introduce ourselves i smile and shake her hand she immediately <unk> and gets very <unk> and <unk> so i knew she was interested 
 but i am a professional i 'd never mess up a career for a lay 
 after everything that was available was set up i went on my way 
 when i got back to my office she emailed me 
 it was the usual thing of small tech questions i would be polite and friendly in my responses but never <unk> or inappropriate 
 as we had a very good relationship with this agency we would do home visits to the staff members if they had small it issues <unk> 
 it was just a small value add providing they did n't take the piss 
 the boss knew not to take liberties with it 
 the girl lived alone laptop printer etc 
 so she gets permission from her boss to get someone round to look at her printer as it was printing lines or jamming paper or something 
 she only lived around the corner from the new office so i <unk> it with a normal checkup visit to the office 
 i finish my visit to the office and ask her if she 's ready to look at that printer so we leave the office and walk to her flat 
 as soon as we left the office she asked me if i had a girlfriend 
 i answered no asked her why and she just said oh ... .no reason ... '' and we continued to her flat 
 funnily enough there was a problem with her printer under the desk it was so i was down on my hands and knees sorting it out 
 some rollers or feeding contraption was loose 
 i shouted to her ok it 's done '' 
 and i stood up and turned around and she was right there in my face with her shirt buttons seemingly loose 
 and that kids is how i met your mother 
 **tl dr** point to the <unk> where she touched you 
 i consider myself quite professional but this is n't the only story of similar <unk> 
 maybe i 'm a <unk> 
 spreadsheets are the worst 
 i’d gotten a call for help late one evening 
 the lady on the phone was not specific about which particular part of her <unk> <unk> was broken 
 with a sigh i grabbed my bag and coat and headed up to her office hoping to leave quickly 
 upon entering the department i noted there was only a single lady left 
 she was busy clicking and typing at a speed i’d only seen in movies 
 it was <unk> 
 & gt fast-click : are you it 
 & gt me : yep 
 whats wrong 
 fast-click went into a <unk> that i could only vaguely fathom 
 i finally realized what it people must sound like to people with no experience with computers 
 it was terrifying 
 fast-click was busy explaining where various pieces of data came from how they are <unk> with other pieces of data 
 i felt my head nodding at things i had no idea about agreeing with things that sounded like i should be agreeing too 
 & gt fast-click : ... <unk> yeah ... basically i need a graph of that 
 fast-click had paused 
 her eyes looked up into mine expectantly 
 ... i had nothing 
 & gt me : er not really an it problem <unk> 
 & gt fast-click : oh 
 her face looked crushed it crumpled back to looking at the spreadsheet in vain 
 her hands were slower now 
 they seemed to tap the keys <unk> compared to the <unk> typing i’d seen earlier 
 my bag felt heavy in my hand i remembered it was time to leave 
 i couldn’t 
 & gt me : where’s everyone else 
 does anyone know 
 & gt fast-click : unfortunately they’ve all gone home 
 i looked at the clock 
 i couldn’t blame them 
 & gt me : maybe leave it till tomorrow aye 
 & gt fast-click : huh 
 oh 
 it’s was actually due a few hours ago 
 don’t worry about it 
 thanks for coming all the way up here 
 she attempted a smile it had a defeated edge to it 
 my mind was in shock 
 i had gotten a thank you 
 an actual thank you 
 a <unk> full thank you just for trying 
 i stood <unk> for a full minute 
 in that time fast-click had <unk> out of her spreadsheets and vaguely searched around other documents hoping to find the solution 
 my mind had been made up as i swung another chair around next to her desk 
 sure i didn’t know much about financial modeling but i knew how to search 
 & gt me : okay what specifically is wrong 
 & gt fast-click : oh no don’t stay 
 it’s so late 
 i can figure this out myself i think ... & gt me : don’t worry i got this 
 & gt fast-click : how much do you know about financial modeling 
 & gt me : almost nothing but the internet ... it knows everything 
 that slight <unk> of hope in her eyes had ignited 
 i smiled 
 that night i spent a few hours searching various terms learning which <unk> to use where 
 it was the most amount of information i’d ever absorbed in the shortest amount of time 
 eventually at a time when normally i’d be asleep it was done 
 & gt fast-click : it works 
 it actually ... ... works 
 **** the next day in it was the largest plate of cupcakes i had ever seen 
 a mountain of <unk> stood <unk> in the break room 
 a single card was placed on the table in front of it 
 pantsuit was nearest the tower and had picked up the card 
 she decided to read it aloud with a <unk> grin 
 & gt pantsuit : to airz thank you so much for going <unk> my expectations 
 x i could feel the eyes of my coworkers turning to me in shocked astonishment 
 & gt me : err ... a voice behind me broke in 
 & gt fast-click : enjoy the cupcakes 
 i turned to see the brightly smiling face of fast-click 
 i wondered how she looked so fresh and also how she had time to <unk> so many cupcakes 
 i didn’t have time to ask however as fast-click was already leaving 
 & gt fast-click : thanks for your help last night airz 
 let’s do it again sometime 
 and with a slight blush fast-click left the department 
 people were still standing around in astonishment 
 & gt messy : airz you and that pretty lady ... did you 
 & gt me : back to work everyone 
 i walked over to the mountain of cupcakes and selected one 
 i tried to decided between the blue or green topping ones 
 eventually i selected a <unk> one 
 <unk> is <unk> time lurker yadda yadda yadda 
 so i work for a fairly large company with offices and locations all over <unk> 
 recently we made the decision to switch from barcode stickers on assets to a rfid built into a barcode stickers just in case we 'll one of the offices that we support that also happens to be the <unk> away from our location is constantly needing new equipment and policy is to inventory the entire office since we may not be near there until the next major error 
 well lo and behold when i get there and replace their main switch which had a coffee spilt on it ... in the locked closet i got to work on doing inventory 
 the first computer had no rfid or barcode 
 thinking this had been an accident of ours by not putting one on 
 well each and every piece of equipment did n't have our tracking on it 
 i then went to the manager at the office and he says that he told his employees to take them off because they were n't needed 
 so after a call to my office i go about <unk> the office and getting the stickers installed 
 after <unk> talking to manager and telling him to leave them in in head back home 
 about 4 months later a coworker went up to upgrade the desktops guess what he found 
 if you guessed that he found that each piece of equipment furniture and technology was bare he gave me a call to let me know 
 i went to my boss and let him know 
 his answer to was for my coworker to not do the upgrades and instead leave them as is 
 not too bad of an ending however it got better 
 about an hour later my boss asks me how i feel about overtime and i go for it 
 the job was to take 30 iphone 4 phones to that office and switch out with what they have 
 for the record each and every employee there had a iphone <unk> issued by the company 
 when i showed up and told them what was happening they were beyond pissed 
 when the manager who was the last one to turn his in asked why they were downgrade i simply said if we ca n't track what you guys have on site the boss says you get equipment that does n't cost so much when it goes missing 
 previously from the <unk> of $ <unk> i learned how to deal with the <unk> that ensue when ups delivers ahead of schedule 
 this story also happened at the dsl provider 
 & gt '' thanks for calling support this is thorssen can i start off by getting your telephone number so i can look up your account '' 
 & gt '' <unk> '' even before the screen loaded i knew i was dealing with a <unk> and this gentleman was of the good ol boy variety 
 these guys are usually pretty cool and this guy 's a bit <unk> so this will probably go alright 
 he 's already got his account set up his modem is reporting back great dsl signal but no lan activity 
 from this i 'm pretty sure i already know what the answer to my next question is going to be 
 & gt '' alright i 've got your account up how can i help you '' 
 & gt '' ah bit you can boy 
 ah live in a doublewide see and <unk> only got the one phone line coming in 
 it comes <unk> mah kitchen see but mah <unk> is in mah <unk> 
 <unk> y'all help me '' 
 alright i think i 've given you the idea about his accent by now 
 i 'm going to clean it up the rest of the way but this is what i was up against here 
 & gt '' i 'm sure that i can sir 
 what kind of computer have you got '' 
 & gt '' an old dell i got from <unk> 
 it 's pretty old though but it does well enough for me '' 
 i look at the rather silly excuse for a computer i 'm taking the call from 
 honestly i think i 'd rather have the <unk> world dell than this pentium 2 driven <unk> piece of crap 
 & gt '' i 'm sure it does just fine 
 so you do n't have a wireless card or antenna for it do you '' 
 & gt '' no sir i sure do n't '' 
 & gt '' that 's fine we 'll have to find another way then 
 how far is it from the spot in the kitchen where you 've got the dsl modem box to where your computer sits '' 
 & gt '' in a straight line it 's only about 5 or 6 feet but it 's got to go out to the hallway and back as it is '' 
 & gt '' well that 's not too bad the cable should reach but you 'll want to tape it down so it stays out of the way '' 
 & gt '' ugh i know what you 're talking about and i do n't think i want to do that 
 say about how wide do you reckon the plug on that ethernet cable is '' 
 & gt '' um ... i do n't know actually <unk> <unk> of an inch maybe '' 
 & gt '' yeah that 's what i was thinking too 
 hold on the line for me thorssen i 'll be right back in a minute or two '' 
 i look at the queue 
 there 's no calls waiting ... i 've got nowhere to be i 'll let the old man do his thing 
 at this point i figure he 's going to go <unk> a power drill punch a hole in the wall and as long as i do n't hear the sounds of him <unk> himself on some wires we should be in pretty decent shape 
 i 've got a browser open and i 'm reading news articles online to kill the time <unk> **bang 
 ** jesus <unk> christ on a <unk> what was that 
 i look around was definitely not on my side it happened over there 
 & gt '' sir are you there '' 
 silence 
 i finally realize i recognize the sound - that was a <unk> 
 <unk> ... i pull up a new tab and start to search for emergency dispatch for the <unk> <unk> worth area and while that 's running i pull up another tab for our suicide procedures to make sure i 've got myself <unk> **bang 
 ** again 
 what the actual f # # # 
 oh this is not okay 
 & gt '' sir 
 sir 
 can you hear me sir 
 are you alright '' 
 & gt '' oh i 'm alright <unk> do n't worry 
 that was just my <unk> you were right by the way just about <unk> of an inch '' 
 & gt '' y ... your .38 sir '' 
 & gt '' yep 
 when you told me how big the plug on the cable was i realized i could put a hole in my wall with my pistol 
 worked like a charm 
 got it wired up now and the emails are coming in now 
 you helped me just fine '' 
 he shot holes in the walls of his doublewide <unk> home with a .38 pistol 
 god save me for i have been speaking with <unk> 
 & gt '' anything else i can do for you tonight '' 
 & gt '' nope but i know you boys do a survey at the end of calls so if you 'll shoot me on over i 'll take the survey and give you a 10 '' 
 & gt '' it ... '' i 'm still a little shaken it was my pleasure sir and please hold to be transferred to the survey '' 
 <unk> still no queue 
 i need a drink but i 'll settle for a dew out of the breakroom 
 god be with whichever qa <unk> has to listen to *that* recording 
 i do n't quite believe it myself ... edit : thank you for the gold kind redditor 
 in the next <unk> i strike a blow against <unk> 
 i worked tech support for a # 1 rated <unk> sunday morning tv talk show 
 one morning i got called to the <unk> because none of the 20 fluorescent lights in the set were working 
 my meter confirmed that the <unk> had <unk> 
 i was assured that they had worked last week 
 i scratched my head while the pressure mounted 
 a dozen people were watching me 
 then i decided to take one of the bulbs out 
 the instant i touched it it started working 
 i had to touch each lamp briefly and they all lit up 
 they thought i had a magic touch 
 in reality someone had disconnected the ground wire to the fixtures in order to troubleshoot a microphone buzz and never reconnected it 
 some fluorescent lamps need a <unk> <unk> near them to start 
 my body <unk> was enough to make it start 
 just do n't tell them that they think i 'm brilliant 
 happy friday everyone 
 here 's a shorter story this time for an incident that just occurred earlier today 
 for those that do n't know i provide tech support to a <unk> hospital 
 today 's tale is courtesy of our hr department 
 ***** lunch time 
 the thirty minutes of peace and <unk> that no man or machine can break 
 the law protects you and watches you as you eat your cheap <unk> for an unpaid 30 minute period ... unless you 're it apparently 
 so while my coworker and i are eating lunch the head hr unionized pencil <unk> we will call her hr lady comes in with a personal camera and looks at my coworker we will call him d while he chews on his sandwich 
 & gt **hr lady : ** hey i want to get some pictures off this 
 hr lady waves her camera around 
 d continues to stare back while chewing 
 i intercept 
 & gt **me : ** we 're eating lunch right now 
 & gt **hr lady : ** this will only take a minute 
 sooo ... she begins looking at d again knowing my position 
 he continues eating without doing much else to acknowledge her 
 & gt **hr lady : ** come on guys 
 & gt **me : ** i 'll come help you as soon as i 'm done eating just give me about 10 minutes 
 even then i would be cutting my break short ... *sigh* & gt **hr lady : ** that wo n't work 
 & gt **me : ** why not 
 & gt **hr lady : ** i go to my lunch in 15 minutes 
 *mental <unk> & gt **me : ** well we can either go in a few minutes or wait till you get back from lunch 
 & gt **hr lady : ** you ca n't interrupt my lunch break that 's against the law 
 my coworker and i just silently stare at her 
 i think she finally got the message because she had the good graces to look ashamed before slowly walking out of the room 
 & amp nbsp **tl dr** i 'm union so my lunch break is more important 
 <unk> <unk> xmas i received an email from my company 's technical support team to let me know their closed days for xmas holidays as well as wishing me a merry xmas 
 i thought that was nice so i replied to the email wishing them a merry xmas in return 
 next thing i know i receive an email from them assigning me a job number # xxxxx for wishing them a merry xmas and informed it would be given a <unk> priority 
 funniest present ever as i was having a shit day until then 
 i came back from xmas holidays to find a new email from tech support telling me that i would be contacted within <unk> days to resolve the issue 
 3 days later they sent me an email saying the matter was closed 
 this occurs back in 2010. summer full of massive <unk> and <unk> 
 i arrive at the office at the usual <unk> check the <unk> and am ready for 8am when the phones go live 
 no messages left overnight 
 the first two hours of the day are taken with mundane password resets locked out of encryption ca n't find a file and so on 
 after i come back from my break the head of it hit and the manager who 's new agency staff tempman approach me and ask if i can spare them a moment 
 i glance towards my boss who nods and off i go 
 & gt hit : it gives me no pleasure to inform you that as of now we are <unk> you on full pay pending a formal investigation 
 the bottom falls out of my world 
 & gt hit : do you understand 
 & gt me : i want my union rep here please 
 they seem <unk> but <unk> to get up and fetch him from the other side of the it office 
 five minutes later he 's sat next to me and hit repeats what he said to me earlier 
 & gt rep : as dpg is a union member and because he 's been here for five years you have to allow him to defend himself here and now 
 you then get to make the decision for suspension based on that 
 & gt hit : the charge is gross professional misconduct *a <unk> offense and one where the investigation is done quickly and <unk> on the grounds of he brought tempman and the it department and the council as a whole into <unk> by his actions 
 rep glances at me and i shrug my shoulders 
 to my knowledge i 've done nothing wrong 
 i 've not posted anything on social media <unk> or the internet in general for ages and certainly not from work 
 my only interaction with tempman was to say hi 5 days ago when he started and to recommend a meeting room to him yesterday 
 & gt me : i 'll need a little bit more to go on than that 
 it 's extremely vague 
 & gt hit : you told tempman that he had to use the main library meeting room for his meeting last night 
 part way through the meeting all it in the building was lost and he was made to look a fool 
 we could have lost out on significant <unk> deals because of that 
 & gt me : the library meeting room was the only one that fitted his exacting <unk> 
 holding 25 people projector screen and network point food services on site and in a building open at <unk> 
 i neither caused the network outage or realised that it was going to occur 
 & gt tempman : it was planned maintenance apparently 
 *he looks <unk> 
 & gt rep : no it was n't 
 there 's no planned maintenance until next month 
 i 'm the one who <unk> it in 
 there was a deathly pause 
 & gt rep : look this is starting to sound like a <unk> against dpg 
 i 'll work with him and let 's find out why the it failed in that building last night 
 give us an hour then make your decision 
 if you still want to go down the investigation route then if you can prove any <unk> we 'll accept the suspension 
 if not and you still <unk> dpg is within his rights to go to <unk> for <unk> or to sue personally if he feels it 's a <unk> 
 they nod <unk> and we go to work 
 logs on the switches show that at <unk> that evening the connection to the wan dropped 
 it attempted every 30 seconds for nearly an hour before finally reconnecting at <unk> we checked the other end of the connection and got the same message although the entire wan other than two buildings were connected 
 & gt me : what have the library and the depot have in common network wise 
 & gt rep : they 're both slow 
 networks are trying to upgrade the link 
 & gt me : why would they both drop within a minute of each other 
 & gt rep : pass 
 i 'll find out what link they 're using 
 perhaps it 's a faulty circuit 
 he calls networks and after a brief conversation hangs up and turns to me 
 & gt rep : google last nights weather for the area print it out and follow me 
 i do as he says and we go back into the meeting room 
 hit and tempman are joined by hr director dir 
 & gt rep : i want this matter dropped immediately otherwise we 'll lodge a harassment charge 
 & gt dir : that 's not the way it works 
 i 've been <unk> on the situation and i ca n't see how you can <unk> this 
 & gt rep : so no dropping this 
 & gt dir : no 
 & gt rep : the library connects to the town hall next door to it by a <unk> <unk> transmitter using <unk> 
 it was done that way because of the problem digging a <unk> across the road 
 last night at round about half past seven it became foggy 
 the depot just around the corner also lost connection at a similar time 
 it too uses a laser 
 & gt tempman : what idiot put that system in then 
 & gt hit : i did 
 tempman looks rather <unk> then he perks up 
 & gt tempman : why did n't you say that the library had this issue and why did n't you call me and let me know that it was getting foggy 
 & gt me : firstly i only found this out ten minutes ago secondly it 's never proven an issue in the five years i 've worked here and <unk> my work stops when i leave here in an afternoon 
 as you do n't pay <unk> or overtime i do n't work for free 
 *i turn to the hr <unk> how do i lodge a harassment complaint 
 tl dr temporary manager attempts to fire me because i can not control the weather 
 update : it management asked me to drop harassment complaint in lieu of a slight promotion 
 i declined 
 i won the harassment complaint and tempman 's 3 month contract was not renewed 
 during those 3 months tempman did everything within his powers and within corporate policies and logical reasoning to deny me anything i asked for 
 it turned out that he and hit were really close friends since university and that some of the better working practices i had suggested already in documented format he wanted to introduce and claim credit for 
 i was <unk> on his toes 
 they ended up paying me compensation in the form of double my annual salary and hit was replaced about a month later after he quit because he accidentally '' knocked an employee down a flight of stairs and broke her <unk> pm yesterday my phone rings 
 i sigh for some reason the later in the day the phone rings the more annoying the call and answer with my best i only have three more days before a glorious <unk> christmas break '' cheer 
 & gt '' can you help me with my computer or do i need to talk to a tech '' 
 oh 
 one of *you* 
 almost <unk> and half my callers still default to believing that the female voice on the phone is a secretary 
 i assure him i can help that i am a tech and - quite literally - the only person here 
 & gt '' well i 'm having a software problem 
 how much will it cost '' 
 oh 
 one of *you* 
 i attempt to get him to troubleshoot a little bit with me but the best i can get out of him is his pc is intermittently <unk> and he ca n't tell me when it happens if there 's a pattern to the bsods any numbers or error information on the bsods when it started happening or if it has been happening with more frequency lately 
 and of course the more questions i ask the more annoyed he gets 
 & gt '' look i just want to know what it will cost for you to fix it '' 
 sigh 
 & gt '' well sir i hate to give a solid quote before i see the system 
 there can be a lot of different underlying causes to an error like this and without being able to run proper diagnostics it will be hard to give you a proper price 
 i will say our minimum fee for most repairs is price and the standard fee for repairs with underlying hardware problems is price + hardware costs 
 however - '' & gt '' but you just said you do n't know what 's wrong with it '' 
 & gt <unk> n't get fired before christmas ca n't get fired before <unk> however we do offer free estimates 
 if you want to stop by and have me take a look at it i can give you a much better quote and that part would be free '' 
 & gt '' finally 
 how late are you open tonight '' 
 i glance back at the clock 
 it is <unk> i inform him that i close in fifteen minutes 
 & gt '' great i 'm only five minutes away 
 i 'll stop by and you can tell me how much it 'll cost '' 
 & gt <unk> i could check it in tonight sir but it 'll be tomorrow before i could take a look at it 
 and i 'll warn you - we 're going to be closed next week and the week after so i may not be able to repair it before the holidays 
 i am still more than happy to look at it but those are our hours for the holidays '' 
 he did n't bother responding and just hung up 
 which sadly i am used to 
 i shrugged and started closing 
 he was back at <unk> this morning 
 i know this because he informed me i 'd kept him waiting for half an hour 
 we open at 10 
 he <unk> a gateway desktop pc on my counter without <unk> and stares at me <unk> save for the complaining about time as i plug it in 
 the poor machine <unk> to life <unk> and eventually <unk> me at a <unk> login screen 
 i have him log in and start some basic troubleshooting 
 every question i ask is met with an increasingly annoyed i 'm not sure it 's my kid 's pc '' 
 of course i can see shadows and <unk> of the errors in the event viewer and various logs but not the fault itself meaning that like i already knew it 's going to have to get the full diagnostic <unk> to figure out what 's wrong with it even though i suspect that the final diagnosis is going to be it 's old '' 
 i pull an intake form out from under the desk and pause before i hand it to him 
 & gt '' well there 's definitely something wrong with it <unk> being a gateway machine running <unk> but i 'm going to need to check it in to find out what 
 before i do that i want to remind you that we are going to be closed for the weeks of christmas and new years - after friday we wo n't be open again until the 4th 
 it may not be done by friday 
 if you do n't want to leave the computer here that long i recommend you take it elsewhere 
 i can give you the names of several other places in the area '' 
 & gt '' so you ca n't fix it 
 why 'd you tell me to drive over here then '' 
 & gt '' i can fix it it just may be january before it 's done 
 i told you that on the phone last night '' 
 & gt & gt '' well how much will it cost '' 
 & gt & gt '' like i said i have to check it in and properly test it 
 it 's not going to be something quick and easy 
 also with a system this old and outdated it 's probably better to just replace it rather than dump a lot of money into fixing it 
 you can get some nice systems around the holidays and almost anything is going to be an upgrade over this one '' 
 & gt & gt '' well then why did i bring this down here 
 you told me you could fix it this morning 
 what do you mean it 'll be january before it 's fixed '' 
 i 'm trying very hard to care enough to be nice to this jerk 
 & gt '' because something is very wrong with the computer and i 'm not sure what it is yet 
 because we 're closing for the holidays for two weeks and nobody will be here to work on it '' 
 & gt & gt '' well why do n't you have a sign up or something '' 
 reddit i tried 
 i did 
 i wanted to be good 
 but i was standing right in front of the <unk> poster with our holiday <unk> warning on it 
 there 's one pasted in the front window too surrounded by blinking christmas lights and forty pounds of <unk> tape to hold them on since $ boss ran out of masking tape and <unk> 
 it 's on our yelp page 
 it 's on our voicemail 
 i 've worked customer service in one form or another since i was <unk> i knew what would happen 
 & gt i said sarcastically like this sign '' 
 of course that sparked the explosion 
 how dare i assume he was stupid 
 he 's just trying to do something nice for his kid for christmas by fixing his pc 
 i 'm the <unk> little redacted that 's keeping his kid from playing that apocalypse game '' later determined to be fallout 4 that he just dropped a ton of money on 
 every statement is <unk> by him leaning across the counter and staring <unk> at me as if i will <unk> before the onslaught of his customer fury 
 eventually i cut through the tirade 
 & gt '' sir i 'm sorry 
 i do n't think i can fix your pc 
 please try a different shop 
 thank you '' 
 it 's my get out of my store '' mantra 
 i merely repeat it until they leave 
 combined with the fact that my please do n't realize i 'm shaking in terror '' face apparently looks like a i 'm about to rip your heart out <unk> <unk> style '' face it makes people go away 
 it did n't work 
 & gt '' i want you to fix it for me now '' 
 what 
 that always works 
 i repeat myself several times 
 he repeats himself several times 
 we must have sounded like a weird broken recording or a <unk> episode 
 eventually he stopped leaned over the counter and in his best dramatic voice <unk> : & gt '' you 
 are 
 ruining 
 christmas '' 
 & gt '' competitor is open every day next week except for thursday 
 geek <unk> is open every day next week <unk> 
 competitor 2 is open until wednesday 
 best buy and <unk> both have pcs on sale right now '' 
 i was very proud of myself for neither a running away or b laughing at the image of his face all screwed up together as he bent over this poor pc to threaten me 
 i hope he thought the shaky voice was my barely restrained fury instead of the <unk> urge to piss myself 
 eventually he did leave threatening to write bad reviews up as he was tearing the assorted cables and cords from the back of the computer 
 he sat in his car in front of the store for several minutes presumably attempting to write said bad review before screeching out of the lot 
 no sign of the bad review yet 
 and the nice lady directly after him could troubleshoot to the point where she had <unk> her own hard drive to eliminate the possibility of hardware <unk> and merely needed <unk> that reinstalling the os was a valid repair choice 
 i almost offered her a job on the spot 
 *edit* for the tale my my nice user go here the office i work in is a big hub and spoke configuration wan with 9 remote locations across the country 
 one day while eating my lunch the power goes out 
 despite my constant protests and demands for multiple battery backups we only had one and the msp who had installed it apparently just bought one at our local computer store and plugged our big vmware cluster into it 
 so i figured i had about 2 minutes to shut down the whole system gracefully 
 i sprint into the server room knocking a sales person out of the way and begin the process and just in the <unk> of time i shut down the last server and watch the lights die on the battery backup 
 i catch my breath gather my thoughts and head back to the breakroom in the now dark office 
 when i get back to the break room that random sales person is now sitting eating my lunch 
 for what felt like 5 minutes all i could do was stare at him with as much hate as i could possible muster 
 his <unk> got me lunch and wrote him up for it sad thing is its not the first time he has done stuff like this notorious for grabbing a whole pizza when the office brings pizza and eating it at his <unk> next couple of days seemed more irritating than usual with angie taking any opportunity to shadow work from almost any its engineer 
 for me there was a <unk> visit to the desk occupied by the hr tank 
 angie appeared mere seconds after my arrival as i walked hr tank how to switch off those stupid red lines under everything i write '' in ms word 
 thinking she was just up there to see hr tank i mostly ignored her while i explained what those stupid red lines were 
 when i got done angie corrected my imminent departure by with now ask your customer if there is anything else you can do for her today '' 
 barely time to react the hr tank rolled herself back in front of the monitor almost <unk> me out of her path 
 actually yes there is 
 i want to know why i ca n't change the text on this button here '' she <unk> pointing at the start menu 
 after two tedious hours of this sea creature barely able to muster the <unk> in her head to stop <unk> as she spoke it was finally time for their regular starbucks visit 
 never have i been subject to the most inane lines of questioning and constant corrections by angie 
 after taking note that hr tank really needs a faster computer '' i take shelter in the canteen kept company by the sole remaining cheese and pickle sandwich they had left 
 did i ever mention i really do not like pickle 
 it was either that or starve 
 i returned to find bhit pacing around the room 
 his <unk> jacket and red face added to his now urgent stance the few <unk> that seemed strapped to the side of his head for once looking <unk> despite their <unk> length 
 he immediately <unk> 
 margie from legal affairs needs her machine back 
 are you done with it '' 
 after racking my <unk> and my ticket list for several minutes i found his solution 
 that was one of the machines removed by you and the third line guys from the meeting room ... '' and so begins the epic hunt 
 we first visit the third line guys who <unk> innocence 
 our next stop is facilities who again have no idea what we 're on about - the facilities manager takes great <unk> to point out that they want nothing to do with it and are getting annoyed with being <unk> 
 a two hour <unk> tour of the building with mafg in tow shows up nothing even the it cupboard is untouched 
 on returning to bhit angie who is fully <unk> on coffee has now just been made aware of the missing machines and is <unk> the ticket systems for evidence of my <unk> 
 sometimes it pays to be an <unk> record <unk> on several of the tickets i noted machine in hands of third <unk> '' 
 angie is her usual helpful self demanding to know why i informed nobody of these machines importance or even questioned where they were off to 
 it 's nice to have a policy one moment of facilities looking after the whereabouts of it kit yet when it goes wrong it goes back to the nearest support monkey 
 i took great pleasure on <unk> the reaction of the facilities manager and also that each machine had been clearly labelled with a ticket number and name 
 after growing weary of angie 's <unk> comments mafg and i spend the final hour of the day searching out any nook and <unk> we come across for either the missing machines or even the facilities guys who did the <unk> 
 it seemed my inspired plan of doing my job and <unk> an <unk> of <unk> was quickly backfiring as the day grew dim 
 on our way to one network riser room we passed margie from legal affairs 
 she could n't help but stop me to ask for progress and relay the updates she 'd gotten which amounted to apparently you managed to <unk> it and still ca n't find it '' 
 nice one angie way to <unk> salt in the wound 
 we had given up 
 in a purely flippant move by pure chance mafg opened the door to a janitor 's cupboard 
 sat behind an <unk> bottle of <unk> bleach and providing <unk> support for a mop and bucket was our ghost server 
 it stood almost majestic it had seen many an its engineer through the worst of conferences and the <unk> of late nights 
 we rescued the discolored hp <unk> from this murky <unk> and carried it back to its 
 we relayed our voyage to bhit as angie stood <unk> glaring disapprovingly at our failure the ghost server standing as testament to their managerial apathy 
 bhit saw no alternative he <unk> that margie 's machine must be replaced by tomorrow morning even if we take another one from stock 
 the other missing machines would have to be <unk> with the facilities department to determine their location 
 after <unk> a bend in the rules was ok just this one time '' i duly began the process of getting the ghost server back up and running to image a brand new optiplex from the it cupboard at my desk 
 i set to work 
 8pm rolled around as the drone of people leaving and passing me by grew steadily to silence 
 i sat <unk> by a single monitor prepping the optiplex with all manner of legal type software domain <unk> etc 
 as i was the only soul left the auto lights had <unk> most of the office only to be activated in sequence by the cleaner almost like a <unk> dancing on the stage <unk> some <unk> performing against the <unk> of the <unk> motor 
 after visiting margie 's desk and reconnecting her new pc i fired an email off to bhit and angie 
 it read : it 's <unk> and i 'm done replacing this machine 
 surely this is a testament to how ridiculous it has been for support lately 
 we have asked several times for a permanent <unk> build and repair area in order to perform our duties after the one we had been using - and had been in use for several years - was summarily decided to be <unk> 
 this matter needs resolution immediately '' 
 feeling authoritative in myself i hoped that demonstrating dedication to resolving these matters would help score points with anyone in the chain who mattered 
 i reached for the monitor switch to sign out for the night 
 but as if big brother were watching outlook 's new mail '' balloon popped up with it 's accompanying <unk> <unk> 
 angie 's name adorned the balloon like a warning label 
 i opened it addressed directly to me were the ominous words we will discuss this tomorrow '' 
 pt1 : a new world order pt2 : safety first pt3 : the it induction from hell pt4 : undercurrents pt5 : how to make friends and ... pt6 : marking territories pt7 : one friday to rue them all pt8 : best laid plans pt9 : its one step for man pt10 : ... and one step back for its decided to post this tale after the attention this comment i made earlier this week got some attention 
 sorry for the <unk> in advance but here 's a tale i have worth mentioning 
 i stand up for my team 
 this reminded me of a similar experience 
 one of my employees had a customer calling in i happened to be doing a random quality listening 
 he was complaining about the company how it was a terrible company he did n't agree with or how we did anything bla bla bla 
 okay that 's fine 
 employee tired to empathize she got cut off he started <unk> at her & gt $ customer you 're f-ing stupid that 's not a solution '' she did n't even have a chance to offer a solution 
 she politely asked him to remain professional and to refrain from cursing i would 've probably ignored it and tried to move on since it was just the first time then he responded by going off on her even more & gt $ customer <unk> f-that you 're stupid i 'll have you fired bla bla bla '' 
 this is n't something i ever tolerate people are human beings you do n't treat people like they 're anything less than yourself or how you 'd treat your <unk> 
 while he was still going off i walked over to her desk said hand me the headset '' she looked puzzled as heck and was like uhm well 
 ok. '' <unk> 's where the fun starts 
 ** hi this is $ aaron1312 i 'm a sup with $ company i 'll be taking over from here how can i help you '' 
 he <unk> responded & gt $ customer oh wth where did $ employee go 
 you people are nuts stupid and <unk> '' 
 i did the <unk> <unk> <unk> was referring to & gt $ aaron1312 : she 's no longer available and i 'll be helping you '' 
 & gt customer : where 'd she go 
 i was n't done with her put her back on the f-ing phone '' 
 & gt $ aaron1312 : no sir i 'm not putting her back on the phone <unk> you 're abusing my employees i will not have <unk> 
 now how can i help you 
 & gt customer : f*** this company i 'm done cancel my account at this point i see he 's not eligible for retention <unk> -- - <unk> & gt $ aaron1312 okay i 'll get the account closed for you do you understand that you 'll have to <unk> for a new account 
 & gt customer <unk> you 
 & gt $ aaron1312 i understand thank you have a nice day 
 after that she looked at me with the most <unk> stare i 'd ever seen and told me thank you i said it 's my job do n't worry about it do n't let these people get to you 
 in the late 90 's i worked for an it company and we had one of those old hp laserjet printers where the toner would bunch up and it would print half of a page 
 you 'd take the cartridge out smack it a couple of times and you 'd be able to print again for ages 
 well we finally ran out of toner and the new cartridge started acting up on about day two 
 you could feel the toner in there but it would get cranky after an hour or two 
 it was bad 
 on about day five which was a friday the boss got pissed 
 he was one of those guys that went from zero to <unk> over a drop of a hat type guys 
 well just after lunch the toner acted up again 
 the boss smacked it against the wall a couple times tried to print and it came out all mucked up 
 this time he smashed the cartridge against the wall and it exploded 
 fine black dust just filled the room 
 covering him in his nice white business shirt his favorite <unk> tie and anything within about ten feet around him 
 he lost it 
 screaming and yelling and almost in tears 
 we all started laughing which made him <unk> 
 we were all ordered to leave the office and not come back until monday morning 
 **tl dr** <unk> cried while being covered in printer toner 
 this is from the audit files 
 i was doing vendor security audits for a bank 
 most of the time these were <unk> show up go over a questionnaire ask a few questions and determine the level of risk the vendor presented to the bank 
 sometimes they revealed bad bad practices 
 other times it was an opportunity to <unk> with a fellow <unk> worker 
 the vendor in question is an outsourced helpdesk vendor 
 i 'm concerned because these guys have fairly serious access in our client 's active directory infrastructure 
 i ask about what they do to prevent compromise 
 somehow we get to talking about sony and phishing 
 the director of is has a rare moment of <unk> : director of is dis : '' we recently did a phishing <unk> we sent 300 employees a phish offering to replace their current dells with macbook <unk> 
 that went wrong fast '' me : '' how '' 
 dis : '' we collected a bunch of credentials and then sent a reminder about how to identify phishing emails '' me : '' ok what went wrong '' 
 dis : '' i sent the reminder 
 i had two users who kept asking when they were going to get their new macbooks even after i called them up to tell them that they responded to a phish '' i ranked them fairly secure especially since anyone who 'd admit to this is only telling me what i already know 
 previous entering the vp’s office i realized the vp seemed genuinely pleased to see me 
 i had an <unk> feeling 
 & gt vp : whilst you were away we had a <unk> <unk> up 
 & gt me : what kind of <unk> 
 the vp rose from him chair and walked over to the door 
 & gt vp : it’s probably easier just to show you 
 as we made our way down through the building in silence i wondered what could have gone wrong 
 too many things 
 eventually we made our way to the delivery dock 
 i wondered what <unk> with it would have happened in such an it unrelated place 
 the delivery dock was located underneath one of the buildings a ramp down from the street led to an underground open area with a few storage garages located on the side 
 & gt vp : airz do you remember before you left i told the marketing department they could have an upgrade 
 i remembered not having the budget for such an upgrade 
 & gt me : yes the vp walked over to one of the garages to the side of the delivery dock 
 he pulled out a key unlocked the roller door and opened up to a <unk> car space 
 & gt airz : wha… 
 i saw about ten boxes lying on the ground on top of a huge puddle 
 & gt vp : see it turns out 
 this week had some particularly hard rain and unfortunately this particular garage managed to collect some of it 
 looking down at the puddle on the ground i couldn’t see the floor it was a fairly deep puddle 
 & gt me : a mini flood in a storage garage more of a building maintenance problem then an it one 
 vp’s eyes caught mine his hand <unk> 
 he looked at though he was about to close the garage and leave it 
 eventually however and with a slightly defeated face he explained 
 & gt vp : remember those pc’s i got for marketing 
 well they got delivered <unk> tuesday so they needed a place to go 
 oh darn it 
 & gt vp : anyway one of the boxes managed to block the drain and we didn’t realize until after it had filled with water 
 & gt me : you managed to leave new computers in a pool of water 
 & gt vp : wha … oh no 
 wednesday morning i went and got it however everyone agreed since they were wet they could be dangerous if plugged in 
 i looked down at the boxes sitting in the middle of the puddle 
 & gt me : so… you realized wednesday and its now monday 
 you left them here the whole time 
 how much bigger is the puddle 
 a look of horror mixed with realization crossed his face 
 & gt vp : oh 
 yeah 
 a. little 
 bigger 
 mostly just deeper 
 f*** sake 
 & gt me : this is mismanagement on a scale i haven’t seen before 
 you’ve left new computers in a pool of water for almost a week 
 & gt vp : speaking of… it’s been a week and marketing wants to know how long till the new computers come 
 i looked down at the puddle of decaying boxes 
 f % * $ this 
 & gt me : i got ta go talk to the big p. & gt vp : so you’re just going to leave them here 
 in a puddle 
 & gt me : does seem a lot like mismanagement does n't it 
 i walked back to the elevators to make my journey back up to the bigp’s office 
 <unk> the elevator door opened 
 & gt vp : wait up 
 i’m gon na come too 
 next so <unk> 
 this was not an angry cry or frustration cry 
 i literally cried my eyes out after leaving this job 
 customer was in his 70 's and i 'm in my young 20 's so i get a ticket for a customer who 's internet stopped working on a friday with a note attached saying his wife passed away this morning and he wanted someone to come onsite monday to setup a new <unk> and printer 
 i was not looking forward to this as it was going to be awkward but a jobs a job 
 so i get there and it was kind of awkward got everything setup and working and he asked if i 'd like to go get dinner somewhere 
 could n't say no well we went to dinner and ended up staying and talking for an hour or so about life and he told me about his wife and football and everything under the sun 
 when i left he gave me the greatest thank you i 've ever gotten and started crying 
 he said it was great to talk to someone and he felt a little bit better 
 on the drive home i started crying and told everyone in my family how much i love <unk> lurker <unk> poster blah blah blah ... i hope this is appropriate for this sub since it 's not technically tech support 
 when i was in college i had a part-time job in the tutoring office 
 the way they handle assigning <unk> is that you can tutor for any class you got an a or b in and having good <unk> at the time + wanting to make more money = i signed up to tutor about 20 different classes 
 i ended up being assigned to tutor an <unk> foreign language class about 90 % of the time but every once in a while someone would book me for something else 
 at my school there was a computer science <unk> that was mandatory for everyone to take or test out of that was essentially how to use microsoft office for people who ca n't computer good and want to do other stuff good too '' 
 every time i checked my schedule and saw someone had booked me for that class i would groan because it meant an hour a week for the rest of the semester sitting next to someone at a computer and saying no open word 
 the <unk> click the <unk> no double click 
 click it two times fast 
 there you go '' 
 so on one particular day in the beginning of my senior year i go to check my schedule and see that not only have i been assigned to tutor this microsoft office class but the student has booked me for a <unk> block twice a week 
 now tutoring is not a free service 
 <unk> get one free hour per class per week but this guy is doing 4 hours a week 
 even if he 's a freshman and getting one hour free that 's still a good chunk of cash to shell out for tutoring 
 before i even meet this guy i 'm <unk> him 
 i ca n't imagine the type of person who needs 4 hours of one-on-one instruction per week on top of 3 hours of class time to learn how to use word excel and powerpoint 
 when i do finally meet him for our first session my biggest fear was confirmed : he was a <unk> student '' aka someone not fresh out of high school aka an old 
 fantastic i thought 
 this is going to be four hours a week of teaching my <unk> how to computer ... i introduce myself to him and another fear i did n't even know i had was confirmed : he had a very thick accent and was struggling with english 
 that 's ok i told myself i 've worked with <unk> students before i can manage ... we sat down at a computer in the tutoring center and i was happy to at least notice he seemed excited to learn 
 he was very friendly and motivated 
 ok 
 i thought 
 this may not be so bad 
 i instructed him to log on 
 he did n't know what that meant 
 i told him to click the username '' box and enter his student id 
 he did n't know what click '' meant 
 he did n't know how to use a mouse 
 he poked at the keyboard <unk> with one finger like it might bite if he was n't careful 
 oh no 
 no no no 
 this was worse than i thought 
 very gently trying not to offend him since apparently i was going to be seeing a lot of him over the next few months i asked him if he maybe owned a laptop or tablet he would be more comfortable using trying to <unk> if he had any computer experience at all 
 he smiled <unk> and said sorry but no 
 i groaned internally 
 but then he continued 
 he informed me that he did n't own a computer because in his village at home they did n't have electricity 
 he had just arrived in the us a few weeks ago on a <unk> visa from <unk> south sudan where he had spent most of his life migrating from village to village escaping <unk> militia groups and most recently had lived in a <unk> <unk> camp 
 he had n't had electricity because he barely had food and shelter let alone a computer 
 so he finally manages to get out of sudan to the us on <unk> <unk> in college and the first class they stick this guy in 
 intro to microsoft office 
 and did i mention : international students have to maintain a c average to stay enrolled so failure was not an option 
 so this guy needed to learn how to use a computer from scratch in 6 weeks to pass his <unk> then pass the final too 
 challenge accepted 
 i 'm proud to say he got a b in the class kept up his gpa and went on to major in <unk> with <unk> <unk> 
 he learned how to use a computer and i learned a valuable <unk> special lesson about judging books by their covers 
 tl dr - one time i got annoyed with a <unk> <unk> for being bad at computers edit : holy shit snacks this blew up and <unk> gave me gold 
 ** thank you you glorious bastard whoever you are 
 background : i worked for a company that handled level one helpdesk for multiple companies 
 i was the manager for a team that handled a larger international company with <unk> users who varied from <unk> nice to people you 'd burn in hell for just so you could have the satisfaction of watching them burn too 
 since i 've recently changed jobs i wanted to share a few tales from here 
 i know there are a few people there who may recognize these so if you do keep it to yourself 
 a while back i was <unk> and doing manager stuff reddit probably when i get it brought to my attention that one of the people on the phone is having trouble with a user so i went over to see what was going on : & gt jb : hey what 's going on 
 & gt tech : put 's user on mute -- this is important this user is having trouble with big name pdf program and trying to upload it 
 it keeps spitting out an error 
 & gt jb : okay 
 & gt tech : i keep trying to fix it but she wo n't let me have the mouse for long and she keeps telling me no ... now 's she 's talking about me 
 at this point the tech is a little flustered and upset 
 she was a nice woman and very sweet so getting berated by an angry harpy was a little out of her comfort zone 
 i really hated it when users bad mouthed my techs or gave them grief when they did n't deserve it but i took a deep breath and told her we 'd figure it out 
 she let the user know i was there and that we were resolving the issue 
 within twenty seconds she tells me that the user is going off again 
 i asked her to give me the headset and put it on -- & gt user : -- f_cking it 
 they are so worthless 
 she has no idea what she 's f_cking doing 
 stupid moron i could f_cking do it 's job 
 now this is big because i 'm of the opinion that if you believe this you should n't be on the phone with it 
 ever 
 so my blood pressure immediately went through the roof and my body started acting before my mind could stop it -- & gt jb : hey **user** this is **jb** i 'm the manager 
 i could hear you talking and just wanted to see what i could help you with 
 the twenty seconds of silence was pure gold 
 she then begins to tell me what is going on what 's wrong and how it needs to be fixed 
 & gt jb : i understand 
 you see that 's *exactly* what <unk> was trying to fix and this is how it needs to be fixed but she said that you were uncomfortable with it 
 & gt user : well it worked before 
 & gt jb : i believe you but updates <unk> funky bits of code stuck in some cache ram *something* somewhere can cause things to not always work properly 
 so would you like *us* to fix it 
 & gt user : sure 
 we went ahead and fixed it 
 and -- <unk> -- it worked 
 the user hung up and called back a few minutes later about a similar issue with a different document and started giving <unk> tech a hard time 
 her reasoning while not totally <unk> was that while it worked the previous time that it was n't permanent and that the fix needed was more than what we did 
 so i got back on the phone 
 & gt jb : this is **jb** 
 what 's going on now 
 & gt user : this is happening again 
 obviously you did n't fix it and i need it fixed 
 again she was n't entirely wrong -- i should have applied the fix to the pdf printer in the devices and printer options rather than on the individual document but i had mistakenly tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and figured it was just the original document 
 & gt jb : obviously we did fix it 
 this is because we thought it was an isolated incident 
 i can apply this <unk> and you 'll be fine 
 & gt user : so it will *never* happen again 
 & gt jb : look i understand you 're frustrated be we are <unk> to get this taken care of for you 
 i ca n't promise that this will *never* happen again because computer systems and software just does n't work that way 
 now i can apply the fix and you can get back to work or we can keep arguing 
 she let us do the fix and she never called in about that issue again 
 what was funny was that for a few weeks after that anytime a tech would put her on mute so they could work on something or ask a question she stop them : & gt user : please do n't put jb on the phone 
 we did n't have any more problems from her after that 
 edit : for formatting 
 edit : gilded 
 wow 
 thanks 
 i worked tech support at my university library as an <unk> 
 everyone was old and/or did n't know how to use a computer 
 one time i was on a call trying to help a user install adobe reader or something we had just upgraded everyone from xp to <unk> 
 & gt **me** : alright this should be easy 
 please open your web browser and- & gt <unk> : wait open what 
 & gt **me** : your web browser 
 & gt **su** : what 's that 
 <unk> questions like this did n't surprise me <unk> & gt **me** : it 's what you use to visit websites 
 & gt **su** : i do n't think i have that 
 & gt **me** : uhh ok do you see the internet explorer icon on your desktop 
 & gt **su** : no 
 *this was a very recently replaced computer they all had ie on the <unk> & gt **me** : do you see an icon that looks like a blue e with a ring around it 
 & gt **su** : <unk> no 
 & gt **me** : ... i 'll be right there 
 i walked up a couple floors to their office introduced myself asked to see their computer 
 they had 4 or 5 instances of internet explorer already running 
 <unk> finally happened 
 they broke in and stole our stuff everything 
 part of me is <unk> that we lost the new hp towers but at <unk> same time i 'm happy that they will finally take me seriously when i say that we should back up background : company started 4 years ago did n't back up even once 
 good thing we 're just a branch of a bigger company so the server is located in that country edit : okay so here is the full story 
 i work for a multinational company that supplies <unk> equipment 
 this company has branches all over <unk> and their headquarters are in the country right next to mine 
 our branch opened in 2012 and we have around <unk> employees 
 i am the sole it <unk> because they are too cheap to hire another employee or send pcs out for proper repairs 
 now i have told management countless times that even though we use an external server for the customer database it 's still important that <unk> have a backup of all the sales and <unk> just in case something goes wrong 
 they refuse common sense 
 i give up mainly because the boss father owns 50 % of the shares in the franchise 
 so yeah it bit him in butt 
 to what actually happened <unk> broke in stole everything electronic and the computers were new too : / 
 naturally head office blames me for everything because i 'm supposed to be a magician 
 to all those asking we did n't have an alarm because we were in a secure compound but it seems like the security guards were in on it 
 previous meetings with my own it staff 
 could be fun right 
 the vp had forced interviews to shake out some ideas from the it floor i was waiting for the pain 
 it was coming 
 fast 
 i sat down in my office with the company consultant and called in our newest member of the it team the <unk> guard itsec 
 & gt me : hey itsec we’re here to talk about it 
 & gt con : what ideas do you think could improve it 
 i looked down at my mug it was full 
 i’ll need every drop 
 & gt itsec : nothing 
 it down here is perfect 
 i took a sip of my coffee 
 it was so good i might not need much at all 
 & gt con : what about a timer for tickets so people know how long you take any concerns 
 & gt itsec : hundreds 
 for example how does anyone tell how complicated a particular set of symptoms are 
 if a user can not login for example it could be one of a hundred things 
 i smiled this was turning out better then i’d expected 
 i looked over at the company consultant she was scowling 
 & gt con : if they can’t login how do they send you a ticket to start the timer 
 & gt me : woah con 
 calm down it’s a valid point 
 con seemed to snap out of her bad mood 
 she looked over at me and smiled 
 & gt con : sorry dear yes 
 very good itsec 
 you can go 
 & gt itsec : don’t you want to hear more reasons 
 i’ve heaps more 
 & gt me : yes 
 love to hear all ….. & gt con : no 
 ……… i mean no your first reason was very convincing 
 send in solitaire on your way out 
 i looked down at my coffee 
 it was still full 
 delicious coffee 
 i smiled 
 itsec was such a new fountain of useful it information now it was time for the it veterans 
 reliable veterans 
 & gt con : solitaire hello 
 we’re here to chat about any it ideas 
 as i took a sip of my coffee i wondered why i ever thought this was going to be a problem 
 i started to <unk> off i dreamt about a coffee beach 
 & gt solitaire : actually yes 
 i think we need a better metrics system 
 & gt con : oh 
 what do you mean 
 the coffee taste in my mouth was <unk> bitter fast 
 & gt solitaire : well the vp was down here yesterday night 
 he was wondering who did the most tickets in it 
 & gt con : who does do the most tickets 
 & gt solitaire : me naturally but at the moment no one can tell 
 airz might have those numbers but he doesn’t tell us 
 coffee was screaming at me to cut this idea down 
 but it wasn’t instant so the message arrived too late 
 & gt me : i don’t think who does the most tickets has anything to do with it… 
 & gt con : airz darling 
 don’t be silly we should be encouraging the employees to be proud of the amount of tickets they complete 
 & gt me : some tickets take longer then others and some people enjoy dealing with certain things more then others 
 i looked over at solitaire reality slowly hitting home that all the forgotten password tickets that he enjoys taking might take a little less time then <unk> anything… literally anything else 
 & gt con : perhaps we could add a expected time to each job 
 & gt me : sorry who would add the expected time 
 & gt con : you would you’re the manager 
 i took another sip of coffee 
 it didn’t give me much strength 
 & gt me : just… no 
 & gt con : solitaire can you go fetch colour-blind and send him in 
 and airz darling you’re not looking well 
 do you need me to look after you 
 i downed the rest of my coffee 
 i didn’t expect such a <unk> 
 the vp was pretty crafty apparently i need to pay him more attention 
 much more attention 
 next ~ cue wibbly wobbly flashback to when i used to work in the it department for a large construction vehicle manufacturer stationed right above the manufacturing plant ~ the warehouse manager comes rushing into the office with fear in his eyes and slams a printout from the <unk> down on the desk 
 & gt warehouse manager : we need to find this part on the system now 
 where is it 
 & gt me : ok ... it appears to be in bay <unk> according to this 
 & gt warehouse manager : it 's not there 
 the system has made a mistake 
 we have to find it 
 & gt me : do n't worry parts get moved around sometimes what does it look like 
 & gt warehouse manager : it 's an enormous bucket for a front loader 
 & gt me : ok have you had a search for it elsewhere 
 & gt warehouse manager : we 've been searching the warehouse for the past few hours and it 's nowhere to be found 
 the system has to have screwed up what can we do to find it 
 & gt me : well we 'll have to audit the warehouse ... ~ several weeks pass ~ two full inventory audits reveal nothing and we 're coming under fire from upper management for losing such a vital component in our system 
 we resign ourselves to the mystery of the world 's first disappearing digger when ... & gt warehouse worker 1 : hey & lt warehouse worker 2 & gt when did they redo the front yard and make it look all pretty 
 & gt warehouse worker 2 : firstly i told you to stop calling me that and secondly i think it was when the suits from head office came to visit last year why 
 & gt warehouse worker 1 : well ... that <unk> bed next to reception ... is n't that made from a huge front loader bucket 
 tl dr : went looking for a front loader bucket turns out it was right under our <unk> the whole <unk> work in a <unk> internet company 
 we are the only providers of the service in this country 
 it sucks and i work <unk> pay is great only because the company provides shit packages for high prices 
 most customers pay 400 $ a month for <unk> a month 
 since the government owns <unk> % of the company and has no taxes they use the <unk> of this company to <unk> <unk> stuff without the need for tax 
 so yeah high prices 
 this usually generates with people complaining and paying late 
 lucky me gets to sit about and go through all the tickets and calls 
 and the customers we get are very aggressive so i have built an <unk> to this <unk> and kept my cool 
 until a few days ago ... i was answering tickets when my manager directed me to a call 
 the lady was super nice and a restart to her router along with a change of a <unk> to static address solved her problems 
 my manager told me to answer the next call since i was already on the line 
 i also have the pleasure of having to harass customers about late <unk> 
 even a payment 20 minutes late is a fine or the customer is blacklisted 
 we randomly generate numbers to make sure the customer answers 
 horrible but company policy and legal 
 i was told it was a late payment 
 the call went like this : m me and c customer m : hello sir this is xxxx and im here calling regarding your late <unk> and overdue fees 
 it appears as though we will be forced to blacklist you and remove certain privileges associated with your account 
 c : why 
 my payment was late due to the banks opening late ... m : i froze that voice sounded really similar c : can you make an exception 
 m : it was my dad 
 umm ugh <unk> c : please ... m : sure sir 
 i have decided to not blacklist you and give the exception 
 i will also remove you from the list of callers and <unk> you to the xxxx class so that you wont get anymore calls even if the payment was late 
 its a privilege for that class c : thanks xxxxx 
 m : no problem dad 
 end 
 a bit shaken i let it go and went back to tickets 
 later that day my manager called me in 
 he said that from the 60 tickets and 8 calls i had answered i been fantastic 
 however from a random inspection of recordings i would be fired 
 the <unk> random search they check 5 tickets 
 i had broken company policy 
 and was forced to leave 
 i also am blacklisted on the company service 
 forever 
 at least my dad is happy with his service 
 but now i need to get a new job ... hey guys 
 inspired by the recent posts about grabbing another person when that other person is you i thought i 'd add my share to it 
 background : i work in development and tech support for a small telco in <unk> 
 every quote is translated from danish 
 technicians do not deal with porting numbers transferring a number from one telco to another - there 's usually a department dedicated to that 
 in this case my female colleague 's phone rings 
 she 's our one man porting department these days due to summer 
 notice : customer is also female 
 & gt colleague : $ <unk> $ colleague speaking how may i help you 
 & gt customer : hello can i talk to a man please 
 & gt colleague : sure would you mind telling me what you 're calling about so i can pass over the information 
 & gt customer : just transfer me please 
 & gt colleague : okay hold on a sec at this point she turns to me and asks if she can transfer the customer to me as she wants to talk to a male 
 as i 'm not too busy with anything else i say yes 
 & gt me : $ <unk> <unk> speaking 
 & gt customer : hello i have a number that 's getting <unk> over to you guys and i 'd like to hear status on that 
 okay i can deal with that 
 usually i just have to tell them the porting date 
 however i see a note on the customer talking about some error or a mistake with the system <unk> here use for keeping track of porting so it 's out of my range of knowledge 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry that 's not really what i do day to day and as i can see there 's something out of the ordinary going on with the porting i 'm going to have to transfer you <unk> & gt customer : can you transfer me over to a man who knows something about that since you do n't 
 why did she even transfer me to you if you do n't know <unk> about porting 
 & gt me : well ma'am as a matter of fact our porting department consists of just women and $ colleague is the only one in this week 
 i almost made a passive aggressive comment about her not telling my colleague what this was about but decided against it 
 & gt customer in a pissed tone : well just transfer me back then 
 i transferred her back to my colleague who answered the question in less than 30 seconds 
 what a waste of everyone 's time 
 sorry if the formatting is n't on point i 'm working with 3 hours of sleep : <unk> firm uses a web based ticketing system for all of our support requests 
 we 've been using this system for years but just like the rest of you we still have users who refuse to use it 
 some of them are vips in the company <unk> that can do whatever they want 
 so when they email one of us individually or use the group email instead of creating a ticket we just let it slide 
 others like to think they 're as important but are nowhere near the level where they can disregard long standing company policy and skirt the ticketing system 
 this is the tale of one such user 
 aside from not using the ticketing system my other pet <unk> is users who give no description whatsoever of their problem 
 they just say broken '' or again '' or fix it '' 
 today 's email simply said help '' in the subject line and it was sent to two of the four of us on the support team 
 i make eye contact with my fellow techie who was also lucky enough to receive it and said i got this '' 
 before we get too far into this story you should know that this particular user and i get along famously 
 she 's one of our special users '' for sure but she 's a great person and we give each other crap all the time 
 her office is 3 floors up and normally i take the elevator 
 i decided this time to take the stairs 
 and i ran 
 i ran as fast as i could 
 by the time i got to her office i was out of breath and a little sweaty 
 she 's sitting there filing her nails looking bored 
 i reach deep back to my high school days and find my <unk> <unk> 
 me : oh my god are you ok '' 
 her : <unk> <unk> me : your email only said help '' so i came as fast as i could 
 can you breathe alright 
 did you fall 
 what 's going on '' 
 mind you i am not being quiet about this so the commotion starts to <unk> some attention from her <unk> coworkers 
 chairs swivel and necks <unk> 
 she starts getting self conscious as all of her coworkers are now <unk> looking 
 her : no no 
 umm my outlook icon disappeared 
 i found it in the start menu but i need it back on my desktop '' 
 me : but you 're ok 
 it 's just about an icon on your desktop '' 
 her : uh ... 
 yeah '' 
 her coworkers start to chuckle quietly 
 me : *deep breath and sit down at her computer* oh well why did n't you say that '' 
 her : i did n't really know how to describe it '' 
 me : your icon is back on the desktop 
 if you 'd like to avoid throwing us all into a panic next time please use the ticketing system and maybe try using your big girl words to describe what 's going on 
 i may show up with building security to make sure there is n't a hostage situation or something equally embarrassing 
 lunch today '' 
 her : <unk> daggers <unk> into my face from her eyes* yeah sounds good 
 hello long time reader first time poster 
 i was a tech support engineer for the best part of 8 years before moving into sales 
 a large chunk of this time was spent working in london as a mobile desktop and server engineer attending onsite to fix things the 1st and 2nd line remote guys could not 
 this is one of my more interesting stories from the job 
 & amp nbsp it was just an average cold day in london in december when i got a ticket to go to one of our largest customers locations and pull some cctv footage 
 this customer was a <unk> customer who owned several <unk> bars <unk> and restaurants around london 
 for some reason this ticket had to be done onsite and not remotely 
 i arrived onsite and was met by the manager and taken to the basement where the cctv system sat next to <unk> of beer and pumping stations 
 the manager sat over my shoulder and watched as i pulled and played the footage 
 around 11pm you could clearly see a guy get ejected from the premises by a security guard then a few minutes later the guy comes back and attacks the security guard with what may or may not have been a bottle 
 the security guard fights him off and he runs off up the street 
 & amp nbsp the manager seemed troubled by this and walked off in <unk> 
 my ticket said i needed to pull the footage and take it back to the companies head quarters and give it to one of the 3 directors 
 i started to pull the footage onto a usb drive when the manager came back with a plane clothes police officer who identified himself as a detective of some kind and asked to see the footage 
 i explained that as i was in the process of pulling the footage i could n't access play back but if he wanted to hang around for 30 minutes i could show him 
 he did n't seem to have time for this so he left me his card and asked me to call him when i had the footage 
 & amp nbsp all seemed normal right 
 i proceeded to return to the company hq with the footage and went to the top floor where the directors can be found 
 i met one of the directors who shook my hand with a smile and said i had <unk> us a tremendous amount of trouble young man we won’t forget what you have done for us <unk> 
 i mean normally this job is pretty thankless at the best of times as we all know so it was appreciated but it did <unk> but hey 
 praise is great right 
 & amp nbsp shortly after i had left the building and was checking for my next ticket my phone my phone rang 
 josh another guy on my team was on the line : & amp nbsp <unk> <unk> 
 have you just completed ticket # <unk> 
 because i 'm being sent onsite with instructions to clear the memory on the same cctv system 
 any ideas <unk> & amp nbsp what 
 why 
 why would they want us to purge cctv footage while there was an ongoing police investigation 
 shit this is not good 
 shit this is stuff that <unk> people fired 
 fuck 
 josh agreed this was strange 
 i asked him to hold fire until i could make a phone call 
 & amp nbsp i pulled out the business card the detective had given me earlier and called him 
 telling him i had given the footage to the director and that we now had orders to purge the cctv system 
 i asked if he needed anything else 
 he said thank you that i had been very helpful and saved him a <unk> amount of <unk> and hung up 
 why is everyone so grateful today 
 & amp nbsp that was the end of my involvement 
 i didn’t find out what happened for another week when i was back in the office 
 it turned out the bar had been hosting the companies own christmas party the night of the incident 
 the guy who attacked a bouncer was a senior member of staff at one of the top bars in london 
 he had got a little out of control thanks to the open bar got <unk> then attacked the bouncer 
 with london being what it was the company was scared that it would make the <unk> and <unk> the entire company brand 
 the request to pull the footage was totally legitimate but the directors planned to bury the footage and have us purge it so prevent their being sufficient evidence for a case to be brought against the staff member and the company 
 we were about to start the process of destroying evidence a pretty major crime 
 & amp nbsp josh had been waiting in the basement by the door so he had phone signal waiting on my call back when he heard a police <unk> outside and a loud commotion 
 the plain clothes officer had screamed back to the bar with his blue lights on came into the bar and pushed the manager out of the way and rushed to the basement to stop josh from removing the footage 
 fortunately josh had not even logged into the system and had the good forward thinking to remove the system from the internet to prevent outside interaction 
 he then pulled a copy of the footage and gave it to the officer who thanked him for his assistance and promised he would keep this part of the interaction vague so josh would not get in trouble 
 & amp nbsp the situation was crap 
 it put me in a tough situation being a 22 year old engineer and having to choose between doing the right thing and keeping things legal or keeping my job being able to pay the bills fortunately nobody found out about my phone call to the police so the people involved just assumed he got onsite too late and the police got their before he could purge the system 
 we never found out what happened in the end but there was no blow back between the client and my company and we didn’t get in any trouble nor did we hear or read anything about it in the papers 
 unfortunately the people who had organised the whole thing and tried to destroy evidence also got away with it 
 so in the end nothing happened 
 & amp nbsp tl : dr : manager <unk> <unk> senior management tried to bury it 
 i was the poor engineer stuck in the middle between having to give the footage to the police and keeping my job 
 several years ago i was working as a help desk tech for a large well known bank in the eastern us 
 now my desk was <unk> of a dwindling number of people ~20 or so for around <unk> bank employees 
 needless to say this made for a stressful environment 
 we had our fair share of idiots but one woman absolutely wins for <unk> idiocy 
 on this particular day high profile vp calls in because she 's having issues looking at anything in her email 
 outlook was and always will be a regular bane of existence so i went through the basics of verification and settled in for what i thought would be a fairly normal call 
 god was i wrong 
 ***me : *** *so tell me ma'am when did this issue start for you 
 * ***vp : *** <unk> i do n't have time to go into a story 
 i just need you to fix my email 
 i 'm about to finish up a multi-million dollar contract and this has to be fixed 
 now 
 * ***me : *** * ... alright allow me to remote in to your system and see what i can see 
 * so i get into the computer and immediately notice a major red flag : her archive file is way over the size limit 
 the system is supposed to cap employee .pst files at 500mb 
 hers was at <unk> 
 sigh 
 of course it was 
 her inbox a <unk> cap was hovering around <unk> 
 the kicker though was her deleted items 
 5gb and change 
 i just looked at that and <unk> 
 ***me : *** *well i can tell you exactly what your problem is 
 you are over your size limit on absolutely everything and i do n't even know how 
 so what you 're going to need to do is create some additional .pst files and move a <unk> ***vp : *** <unk> man what part of 'i do n't have time did you not grasp 
 i 'm not going to do that now 
 i ca n't move anything into my archive and i need my email fixed without jumping through your stupid <unk> 
 * ***me : *** <unk> well the only other thing that i can try to do is clear out space in your main inbox 
 is that alright 
 * ***vp : *** *i do n't care what you do as long as you get it fixed 
 jesus christ why do you people always have to ask questions 
 do you not know how to do your job 
 * ***me : *** <unk> i just have to <unk> ***vp : *** <unk> 
 it 
 * fine 
 so i immediately selected <unk> files - & gt right click - & gt delete 
 a <unk> of pure terror and <unk> flooded out of my headset the likes of which i have never before experienced 
 i started to ask what the problem was when she <unk> ... ***vp : *** <unk> just deleted all of my most important emails ... * ***me : *** <unk> no 
 i emptied your deleted items folder which was massively over size 
 * ***vp : *** *that 's where i kept my most important ... there were years of vital emails in that folder 
 i could n't move them to my stupid archive because my fucking email never works 
 you just deleted all of my most important emails 
 * ***me : *** *you have got to <unk> would you put anything important in your deleted items 
 * ***vp : *** <unk> them back 
 all of them 
 and then transfer me to your manager 
 i can not believe this 
 <unk> ... * ***me : *** *i do n't have the ability to do that 
 all of your emails are stored locally 
 there is no server backup 
 we would have to send out a tech to run an <unk> tool 
 the <unk> of which can be out later today ... * at this point i am in disbelief and she 's just screaming obscenities at me so i calmly tell her i 'm putting her on hold to get my manager 
 he listens to what just happened puts his head in his hands and tells me to just kill him 
 at least i managed to keep my job that day <unk> department has there data on a usb disk plugged into a desktop 
 shared to the employees ... yes ... i know what you are thinking 
 i have been warning for years about this 
 they get a new director ... the usb disk is starting to fail <unk> and requires it to be unplugged here and there 
 i told her it is time to pay for a network share our university charges for services which is why no one uses them 
 she agrees ... i take the failing usb disk which was around 150 gig of junk 
 i put it on a temporary server 
 i create an official network share for them and give them both links 
 me : please move your important data from the temp directory to the official one 
 leave what you do n't care about.. this temp server is get wiped in about a month 
 usb disk gets wiped and destroyed 
 forward a year 
 they want something from the temp directory they have not even touched in a year 
 me : i am sorry that server is long <unk> as of about about a month ago which means it has been up for <unk> months 
 since i took there usb disk i must have their data and they are pissed at me even though i warned them about it several times 
 my fault 
 of course 
 edit : the usb disk was destroyed because it was failing and we destroy stuff that we no longer need 
 it is protocol 
 we have a big hard drive <unk> and we use it 
 great <unk> few years ago we got the kids a pc for christmas 
 i set it up and created accounts for each child with appropriate time <unk> and login times 
 now like most kids they are <unk> with minecraft 
 i played it a few times found it beyond boring and regretted that i spent $ 20 on it 
 but i <unk> 
 when the kids were n't playing minecraft they were watching youtube videos of other people playing it 
 this of course led to the inevitable i wan na make my own minecraft videos '' 
 so they download a screen recording program and get me to use my admin access to let it install 
 and every time they want to run it i have to go upstairs and type in the admin password 
 fuck this noise 
 they 're getting *just* as tired of it as i am 
 they whine and complain 
 just give us admin access '' 
 hell no 
 i saw what you did with admin access to the laptop you had been using before you got the pc 
 i had to reinstall it <unk> <unk> because you managed to load it with viruses 
 get a different video recording software 
 they look around but all of these applications require admin access because of the way they interface with <unk> 
 on the product 's website it even says you must have local administrator access in order to run the program there is no way around this '' 
 i go searching 
 surely there must be a better way to do this that does n't involve giving the children the technological equivalent of a loaded gun 
 the wisdom of the <unk> remains firm 
 the program requires local admin access in order to function 
 the documentation and the product faq both say so 
 and as we all know programmers are never wrong 
 but i 'm a unix admin 
 i find windows to be stupidly restrictive and there 's a <unk> at play here : there 's no way to run an application with administrator privileges without typing in the local admin password 
 unix has this ability 
 it 's called sudo 
 as in <unk> make me a sandwich i check 
 there is in fact a sudo for windows 
 it uses a service that runs as the local administrator to spawn off child processes that run with elevated privileges based on rules in an <unk> file 
 i edit the file and add the program path and the kids accounts to the authorized users list 
 & gt **me : ** login as yourself 
 & gt **child # 2 : ** why 
 & gt **me : ** you want this to work or not 
 & gt **child # 3 : ** yes 
 & gt **child # 2 : ** i <unk> 
 but how 
 the guy who made it said there 's no way to make it work without admin 
 & gt **me : ** because we all know he 's the absolute authority on all things computer 
 i roll my eyes so hard i give myself a headache & gt **child # 2 : ** it 's not going to work 
 just give me admin 
 & gt **me : ** just log in for <unk> 
 & gt **child # 2 : ** <unk> fine 
 he logs in then <unk> <unk> on the icon for the program 
 predictably it throws up an error stating that it needs local admin access 
 & gt **child # 2 : ** see 
 now give me admin access 
 i take the mouse from him right-click on the icon and select *run with sudo* there is a moment of dead silence in the room as the program starts up 
 & gt **child # 2 : ** *how 
 * & gt **child # 3 : ** he 's smarter than you dummy 
 & gt **child # 2 : ** shut up 
 child # 2 then proceeds to right-click on firefox and selects *run with sudo* 
 predictably it fails with an <unk> <unk> error 
 & gt **child # 2 : ** so that 's the only thing i can run 
 & gt **me : ** what do i look stupid to you 
 i let you run anything else as admin and this pc will have more viruses than a ... <unk> sick person* 
 i manage to stop myself from saying $ 5 <unk> '' in front of an 11 year old 
 yay me 
 & gt **child # 2 : ** oh 
 ok. well thanks 
 all was right with the world until he managed to install some kind of spyware that set up a local proxy server to redirect all browser traffic through 
 when <unk> removed said spyware the web browser stopped working 
 i 'm still trying to figure out how he managed to install spyware 
 edit : <unk> props = { <unk> : false <unk> : true <unk> : '' here } hey guys so it 's me again with friend who is a manager at a hosting company 
 this time another tale of a guy who wanted out of the company 
 so this guy had a vps virtual private server which is just a tiny vm living on a massive host 
 also worth mentioning : the company offers clients the option to pay full price for the host if they have a dedicated server and take it away with all their data and no support after that 
 so the guy called in : *guy* : hey i want to cancel my service 
 when can i come over and pay for the server and take it home please 
 *friend* : finds his info well sir it seems that you have a vps so the server does not really exist physically 
 if you 'd like to cancel you will have to migrate the data off yourself and buy a server elsewhere though that would be very expensive and likely not worth it 
 mind you this guy is paying 12 $ a month for 2gb ram and <unk> of ssd 
 *guy* : look i do n't care if it is virtual or real or whatever you said i want the server home so my son can play minecraft with his friends 
 *friend* : that is unfortunately not possible 
 friend could have made him pay <unk> for a physical host install a <unk> and give him the vm but that would make him no profit and this guy was difficult enough to deal with 
 *guy* : give me the server or i will sue you 
 *friend* : secretly hoping it would come to this since you have threatened legal action i have no choice but to terminate this call 
 you will be hearing from our lawyers on legal action moving forward 
 **click** **tldr : ** is this the real life 
 is this a virtual machine it finally happened 
 after nearly a year of working for my school 's help desk i found that user 
 the magical mythical user that goes out of their way to do their own research on a problem and try to fix it on their own before calling us 
 i got scheduled to go out to her office to troubleshoot a slow computer and when i got there she said that it had been running fine all day but she had an issue with some monitors she got 
 most desktops on our campus are older dells that have a proprietary video card that needs a splitter to use two monitors and it only works for dvi 
 she was given vga cables and was really confused about how she was supposed to use the dvi splitters we gave her 
 here 's the crazy part 
 instead of calling and just asking for new cables and us having to spend a crazy amount of time trying to figure out what she needed she took time to look up video cable types and put in a ticket herself asking for dvi cables instead of vga 
 she said she pulled up a diagram she found on google and figured it out using the cables we gave her 
 so i instantly ran and grabbed her the dvi cables she needed and helped her set them up around the building the monitors were in and she even set up two on her own 
 crawled under the desk and everything and she did n't even need to 
 i would 've gladly done it all especially with how nice and helpful she was and it was n't even the thing i got sent out on 
 so now if she ever calls in i 'll gladly go out and help her with whatever she needs 
 best user ever 
 edit : i used the wrong form of their rip in <unk> request my nice customer 
 by some <unk> universal sense of humor this took place about twenty minutes or so after the events of : i 'm ruining christmas '' phone rings mid coffee 
 i regard it <unk> after my entertaining morning 
 my polite phone spiel is a little less chipper than normal 
 & gt '' hi i have a toshiba laptop 
 do you work on those '' 
 at least it 's a normal question 
 i answer yes pleased that $ clone had mr. christmas <unk> beat at being a decent human being just on vocal tone and she 'd barely said ten words total to me yet 
 she asks how long a software fix might take to fix and i ask her to describe the problem 
 & gt '' well it boots up okay but when it gets to windows all you see is a black screen with a cursor 
 it 'll boot up in safe mode all right but not normally '' 
 the reference to safe mode should have tripped me off but my brain was still <unk> down 
 & gt '' <unk> 
 that 's a tricky one 
 how long has it been doing this 
 did it just start today '' 
 i gauge the systems on my desk trying to anticipate if i should tell her to bring it in or if it 's hopeless to try to repair this before friday 
 i 've seen this error before and it 's usually hopeless once it gets to that state 
 at least a windows reinstall does n't take long 
 & gt '' well off and on for several months probably almost a year 
 it would work fine once you rebooted but the last few days we have n't been able to get it into windows at all '' 
 months '' was my trip 
 bad hdd screwed up windows update minor malware - any combination of those two can set windows into permanent <unk> mode and for an error that 's been in the system that long it usually has hardware at it 's core 
 i got a few more details about her system and the specifics of the error 
 & gt '' i 'll warn you it 's not good 
 i would definitely have to have you check it in so that i can run diagnostics on it - this error is commonly a problem with the hardware 
 i could probably get it done before friday but no guarantees '' 
 i go to load up my we 're closed for the next two weeks '' speech when : & gt '' well i thought that too so we got a new hard drive and i cloned it over 
 but it 's still doing it - would that mean it 's a virus '' 
 i damned near dropped the phone 
 first i get accused of being somewhere lower than the <unk> on the scale of 1 - <unk> and now ... *now i have a unicorn 
 * & gt '' you ... cloned your own hard drive '' 
 i immediately felt bad because she got slightly <unk> and asked if that was wrong 
 & gt '' no no you do n't understand 
 i was about to ask if you even knew what a hard drive *was* 
 i was trying to figure out how to explain that 'the thing with all your pictures on it might be damaged '' 
 & gt '' oh 
 yes i know what a hard drive is 
 my husband really was the one that cloned it i 'm not super <unk> but since the error stuck around we were n't sure where to go from here '' 
 i explained about drive corruption and bad sectors and how damage to system files would persist across a <unk> due to the nature of both a bad sectors and b the <unk> <unk> process 
 & gt '' so can you fix it '' 
 & gt '' i 'll be honest with what you 've already told me you 've tried i 'd suggest a <unk> reinstall 
 i can sometimes fix this error but the system usually does n't work great afterwards and it 's only got about a <unk> chance of working at all 
 it 's easiest to cut to the chase and just start over '' 
 & gt '' oh sad 
 i thought it would be that i was just hoping since some of my programs are annoying to reinstall 
 i can do a windows reload i just i just wanted there to be an easier answer '' 
 she laughed 
 i <unk> 
 & gt '' yeah if you can reinstall your own windows that 's going to be the fastest 
 just do n't forget to back up all your data '' 
 she laughed again 
 & gt '' yeah you only make that mistake once right '' 
 <unk> 
 she said she made that mistake once 
 i remember this feeling - i 'm falling in love 
 * she asked a few questions about if i had any tips about reinstalling windows i warned her to make a list of software she had on there first and double-check for finicky drivers 
 she lamented how bad she was at this again and promised that when she got stuck she 'd call me for help 
 i almost asked her to send me a resume but i could n't break a magical creature like that 
 better for her to stay where she was protected 
 safe 
 <unk> 
 besides the pay here is shit 
 she asked if she owed me anything for the advice 
 i said no that while i could have made time for her reinstall i really was busy and it works out better for me this way 
 she asked if i was sure 
 i told her that never in over a decade and a half that i 've been doing this some professionally some as the friend who knows computers '' have i ever had someone call me who even <unk> that a hard drive could be cloned save one dba who does n't do his own hardware work - but he 's special and it was my <unk> <unk> to assist a competent user 
 i still do n't think she believed me but she was grateful for the information and swears she 'll call back when she breaks something 
 a part of me hopes i 'll never hear from her again a part of me sincerely hopes i will 
 this is years ago when i was a poor <unk> who just got started in it and i forgot the details but a recent fire drill at my current employer reminded me of it 
 the shortest time i ever worked for one employer was one week 
 i started work on a monday as 'the it guy meaning that as long as it had *anything* to do with computers it landed on my desk 
 technically i was part of the 'it department but since that consisted of me the guy i was temporarily replacing who was <unk> and the hr lady who <unk> as <unk> of it but did not even know what an ip address was in practice i was just the only occupant of the it office / service desk who got to jump when a clueless <unk> called the servicedesk with an it problem usually a lost password 
 thursday the fire alarm goes off 
 there 's no panic so i expect it was just a drill even if we were not informed before 
 now i do n't particularly like the idea of becoming a <unk> so i decide it was better to be safe than sorry 
 i locked my pc before i went outside having just grabbed my coat 
 cue some joking with the others in the company while we wait for the alarm to stop 
 my feeling it was a <unk> <unk> is proven correct when security guy comes outside and tells us we can return 
 hr lady comes by and proceeds to flip out that i left the desk because what if an urgent call <unk> in '' 
 i point out that there was a fire alarm but she claims i should 've known better and that it is vital that it is manned at all times 
 i ask her how i was supposed to know it is a drill / false alarm and she says that does n't matter i should 've remained at my post 
 i ask her to point out where i missed in the employee handbook that it was supposed to ignore fire alarms which of course is not listed there 
 perhaps a bit confrontational but i firmly believed i was right 
 the next day i arrive at work and am resolving various tickets for perhaps two hours when hr lady comes by with the security guy and tells me to pack my stuff 
 i am fired and since i 'm still in my one month trial period there 's nothing i can do about it since we both me and the company have the rights to back out for any reason 
 tldr : i heard a fire alarm and left my desk and got fired over it.i worked tech support in a 2nd line role for 2 years before i left to pursue my dream as a web developer 
 i love tech support and am always willing to help someone out but i also really enjoy writing code 
 as it is a small team my new position entails various roles but the 97 % of the time is working on the company 's website 
 for the first time since starting i was asked by another member of staff to provide support to a woman who insisted our website was down 
 call forwarded to me i did a quick check 
 the website was not down 
 & gt $ me : hello <unk> speaking how can i help you 
 & gt $ user : hi yes i want to place an order on your website but i am unable too & gt $ me : okay just talk me through what you are doing i will be happy to help 
 & gt $ user : well i go to google type $ <unk> and its not there & gt $ me : not a problem 
 in the same place you typed <unk> if you can just type $ <unk> it should come up for you 
 & gt $ user : oh wow 
 thank you 
 thank you so much 
 good bye ... *click* after a few frantic searches i turn to my manager : & gt $ me : boss we have a problem we are no longer listed on google ... so this happen literally this morning 
 i was sitting at my desk happily minding other peoples businesses when i had an alert 
 the worst kind of alert 
 server name '' '' is <unk> <unk> occasion 
 i immediately called the company to just alert them that their network shares etc will be down whilst i figure out what went wrong when i was made aware that they had switched the server off and on '' 
 my immediate question was how 
 because i know full well there was no engineer on site today 
 the person nonchalantly replied oh i turned it off at the wall '' my shock must have been apparent and i <unk> why did you do that '' 
 he replied how else was i supposed to 
 there is no screen '' 
 me please do n't do that again please just ask us '' i hung up the phone and i sit here waiting and praying that the server comes back online because i do n't want to have to fit in an already full day with a site visit to repair god knows what may have gone wrong with the server after an improper shutdown **edit : the server has just come back online <unk> until a few years back if any employee called internal it at the big telco i work for saying they forget their password our <unk> <unk> script-monkeys would ask for your name which doubles as your username within the network and then immediately say your password was reset to 'the default : <unk> 
 they 'd them ask you to change it yourself to something more secure as per script and hang up politely 
 my last tale and some others explained that our internal it grew so big they started cutting corners contracted down and have some terrible policies 
 but to my team - tech support 's senior staff - this one always seemed particularly unacceptable 
 anyone who knew this and had their number could theoretically pose as any employee of the same gender and get access to anyone 's account and personal drive through a default password reset 
 this had been formally reported as utterly unacceptable security several times over a <unk> <unk> period prior to the following <unk> yet nothing had ever been done about it 
 my colleague at tsss called frank in many of my tales such as this one had the biggest axe to grind with this particular security issue 
 we have many more of those unfortunately but he was personally <unk> by this one having had a personal experience where he was screwed by another company because they were doing the same damn thing 
 he really wanted it to change and told me about how he 'd get it done since proper channels did n't work 
 asked me about his scheme 
 i <unk> on the side of caution with my advice ... & gt bytewave : i would n't do it this way 
 19 out of 20 it works sure but calls are recorded voices are <unk> 
 someone figures it out and you 'll lose your job 
 we 've been here for a damn long time and you like the job despite the crazy right 
 can try through proper channels again 
 it 's insane they never fixed it after it 's been reported so many times but i would n't stick my neck out to clean after systems manglement '' 
 & gt frank : sure i do like this gig but we 've got access to the call monitoring software 
 can immediately delete the recording do everything from a test lab '' 
 & gt bytewave : deleting calls from that software always worked so far but if someone with a really good suit gets pissed there are data recovery options 
 i know we 've taken liberties but your idea is <unk> your way into upper management 's email to prove your point 
 forget job union security that 's being instantly fired if caught - and there 's no <unk> in this country who will roll that back no matter the grievance 
 basically all i 'm saying is it 'll probably work but it 's your ass - and i 'm not sure you should be risking a job you like for them '' 
 union staff sometimes think we 're <unk> because we get away with a lot more than others without being fired but it 's important to keep in mind there are lines you cross at your own <unk> 
 frank wanted to and i could n't talk him down that day 
 personally i was also concerned because we need him around he 's not someone i 'd consider <unk> - to put it lightly 
 but he went forward with his gamble 
 by trying to log into someone else 's internal account from the lab a few times with random passwords he got their account locked and then reached for the lab 's phone ... & gt frank - dialing internal it from a test lab : this is <unk> thomas exec assist to the call centers <unk> 
 i 've locked myself out of my account i did n't see caps lock was on and i really need to ... '' & gt systems : <unk> thomas login <unk> executive assistant for ... '' & gt frank : <unk> with two <unk> but yes '' 
 & gt <unk> : your internal password is reset to <unk> temporarily you must immediately change it to something else for security purposes 
 anything else we can help you with 
 & gt frank : no that will be all 
 thank you '' 
 frank logged in the <unk> purposes call monitoring tool and deleted the recording 
 then he logged into the vice-president 's secretary 's account using the default password and emailed several people at upper management with multiple scans of evidence this particular security risk had been <unk> without results for years a seven words apology and a <unk> face 
 he did n't look at or touch anything else even though he was briefly <unk> to tons of things upper management would likely never want a union employee to see 
 i at least thought pretending to be one of the executive <unk> rather than a vp himself was a nice touch good way to keep a lower profile while still getting access to their data - but he still <unk> his job a little <unk> 
 the next day the <unk> 's secretary could n't log in his workstation obviously and likely called systems who then reset his default password to the default password 
 that 's when he 'd have noticed upper management was in an <unk> about a 'major security breach 
 i do n't know how it all played out from there but very soon after we learned a frontline sales employee who called systems for a password reset was told 'that can not happen at this time you 'll remain locked out for the rest of the day due to technical issues 
 the poor girl freaked thinking she was getting fired for some reason until her manager told her otherwise 
 she spent the whole day waiting not taking a single call unable to log into her account 
 upper management had handed down orders that no password resets were to happen until further notice 
 only three days later they came up with a more secure solution in line with most of the industry 
 in the meantime anyone who knew could have purposely locked themselves out of the network - and would have then been paid to do no work - but very few people ever learned what was actually going on 
 frank took a rather big risk - but who am i to argue with results 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 <unk> rings ... * me : it 
 nurse : this computer is <unk> it wo n't work 
 me : can you explain what you mean by broken 
 is it on 
 nurse : it 's on i ca n't do anything 
 me : have you tried turning it off and then on again 
 nurse : *sigh* okay i turned it off it 's back on and it 's the same 
 me : <unk> that was way too fast you could n't have turned it off 
 nurse : i <unk> you need to make this work 
 me : i 'll be there in a minute 
 *i arrive and said nurse is still at the computer 
 * me : can you show me how you turned it off 
 <unk> reaches forward and powers off the monitor waits 3 seconds and powers the monitor back on 
 * <unk> managing to control my laughter i hold the power button on the tower count out loud to 15 and power the machine back on 
 * me : that 's how you power cycle the computer the power button you were using was for the monitor 
 nurse : whatever 
 <unk> logs in and starts working 
 * this typically happens a couple times a week nurses and doctors <unk> 
 i guess i just expect too much 
 no one shows up for any it <unk> that are given to teach <unk> i wrote a comment about an office move at my previous employer where i was told that air con was not as cost efficient as opening a window 
 there is a bigger story to it which is really worth sharing 
 so i joined the company after a long <unk> with a very well known organisation in the uk 
 at that job my opinion was largely respected i was part of some major projects and regularly sat on advisory boards for it within the org 
 the only thing lacking was the <unk> <unk> and after 5 years i had reached a <unk> 
 the interview was good 
 a strange location but close to home and reasonable pay managing a small team 
 some tough questions thrown in but nothing i did not know how to handle or had n't come across in the past 
 i got offered the role and started after a brief notice period 
 many platitudes were thrown my way by my director at my leaving party and there was a genuine feeling of loss from everyone in the department in the build up to my last day 
 i started in the new role and quickly tried to get the lay of the land 
 i sat with the staff and asked what they do and how they do it 
 one particular member of staff was prone to working from home to cover sick leave which i had been told to get a handle on 
 i changed the working from home policy '' and within two months my entire team '' had attempted to have me fired by <unk> '' that i refused to let the team have my password and i was hacking the computers 
 it ended with the <unk> being let go so i was down one member of first line 
 in short the outgoing it manager was related to the boss and was being moved sideways 
 the team itself was a <unk> bunch making do with what they had been left with after an it <unk> had <unk> up the systems years previously 
 two of the staff had no it experience and had been placed in the department to keep them from causing trouble '' 
 under my management the department transformed 
 i put in place loads of efficiency changes to get the department doing things right simple things like <unk> to <unk> pc images and <unk> for patches 
 i got the department new servers and got the systems to be almost automated to the point where the it department mostly did document management first line support and development 
 we got to <unk> in an office move 
 a seemingly normal thing for most it departments but in our case it was a minefield especially given that we were being given one month to do it in including <unk> runs for internet 3 month lead time from <unk> in the uk 
 so we get the move done in 6 weeks 
 on the day the new office opened we had one call about a printer not working 
 i sent an email stating to our absent boss that it had gone well 
 i got an email back stating that it was <unk> that the printer issue had n't been identified in advance 
 i was gobsmacked 
 i had been having discussions with a <unk> who was <unk> for a huge once in a lifetime role and i 'd been putting him off for a week because i was n't confident about one particular area they kept going back to 
 i called and said i 'd go for it 
 so the interview went well i had a good chat with the potential new boss and waited 
 the next day i had a sit down with my <unk> : & gt fl : hi <unk> i need to let you know i am moving out of the area 
 i 'm going to be handing in my notice 
 i 'm going to use the <unk> as a early retirement 
 & gt me : wow that is really good for you 
 obviously i am really sad that you will be leaving but i hope you enjoy the new home and the retirement 
 & gt fl : thanks 
 i wanted you to know before i sent the letter to hr 
 so the hr dept is notified and later that day my boss has a brief exchange with her : & gt boss : i hear you 're leaving us fl 
 & gt fl : yes 
 i 've bought a new house and am going to do it as an early retirement 
 & gt boss : well good luck we all wish you the best 
 fl leaves shortly after for the day and i stay behind to discuss the future it first line support 
 & gt me : fl retiring is a bit of a shock 
 & gt boss : yes but it 's a good thing 
 she 's a troublemaker and always has been 
 it will be good to see her go 
 & gt me : slightly taken aback ok. so should i get on to the agencies in the morning and put out a <unk> 
 & gt boss : let 's not 
 i want to assess how the department <unk> without one more troublemaker 
 at this point my brain is screaming 
 i was already working weekends on supporting the remote sites and was trying to get things running properly - i was close but needed the extra person 
 i thought about how i could really change everything with a new hire that would be on board with me 
 i went home and lamented my situation 
 the offer from the interview had n't <unk> 
 i spent the next few days contemplating my future and dealing with a rapidly overheating server room 
 then i got a call 
 & gt agent : they want a second interview with you 
 it 'll be with the md and the department director 
 & gt me : when are they thinking 
 & gt agent : two days from today 
 & gt me : it 's short notice but i will be there 
 the interview goes really well 
 i get the job offer on the train after leaving the interview i recall reaching home and crying in front of my wife in pure <unk> and the letter comes through 
 i have a chat with my team and tell them i will be leaving 
 at this point the second line tech states he has taken an offer as well 
 i realise the <unk> of the situation 
 i go back to my desk and fire off my email to hr 
 the pa to the boss pulls me aside 
 & gt pa : what the bloody hell is going on 
 & gt me : excuse me 
 & gt pa : have you been planning this 
 & gt me : do n't be ridiculous 
 & gt pa : ok then where is your offer from 
 & gt me : big company 
 the salary is <unk> i would be mad not to take it 
 & gt pa : what about tech 
 where is he going 
 & gt me : i do n't know 
 with that the department was left with only the <unk> 
 she quit the next day 
 we had a meeting as a team with the boss who essentially said he wanted us to keep it to ourselves and not share the knowledge with the other departments before he could announce what the plan was 
 basically it was outsourced 
 i sat with the company selected and handed everything over and they <unk> me on a good setup saying they had never taken over the it with such ease 
 this did n't make an impact on my boss though 
 his pa was instructing hr to advise that i was taking unauthorised breaks and spending too long making phone calls on my mobile 
 i politely stated that the calls i made were for company support issues and that the breaks were legally protected in a manner which said f*** off - you are trying to be silly now '' 
 i asked read <unk> to be let go early to which my boss wrote back it 's my decision i 'll decide when you go and if you ask again it will be the full 3 months '' i rang the new boss and asked if a shitty reference was a show <unk> explaining that the situation was <unk> rapidly and he confirmed a reference was not a condition of the offer 
 i went and made a coffee in the break room with my staff ... i said my <unk> wished them luck and got hugs from the female staff 
 i told them to follow procedure immediately disable my account and packed my company assets into a envelope which i placed on the hr managers desk 
 i then got up <unk> out leaving my pass on the hr desk afterward and went for a final permanent lunch <unk> i 've posted earlier i work tech support for a major american airline but we also have a lot of international service as well 
 being based in the states our default language is english and most of our international callers have a pretty good command of english 
 others have dedicated language lines they can all for support as well 
 but some people fall just in between 
 enough of a command of english to get by day to day but when talking over an often <unk> connection and using precise technical terms there are often <unk> 
 this came about during an attempt to start a remote session 
 they are calling from somewhere east of the iron <unk> and communicating is not very easy 
 i 'm spelling out the url for him to enter and like a good airline employee using the nato phonetic alphabet that pilots use in order to spell it out 
 after a few failed attempts to navigate to the url i try to hold his hand and slowly walk him thru the process 
 i shall name the caller boris 
 me : '' okay that 's r as in <unk> e as in <unk> m as in <unk> o as in <unk> ... .. '' boris : why is name so long 
 <unk> <unk> could be much shorter '' 
 of course boris was writing out the full names of phonetic alphabet 
 i advise him of this me : '' sir i 'm just using the nato phonetic alphabet that pilots use do n't actually type those words '' boris : '' nato 
 i do n't want nato spy tools in my internet get it out i do n't need any of your <unk> 
 boris is of course fluent at swearing in english 
 me : '' sir it 's just an alphabet not anything else '' 
 boris : '' you insult my smarts and my country i hang up now figure it out on my own '' and he hung up leaving me to explain to a supervisor the next week why i was being offensive against his <unk> '' 
 i explained the details and we had a laugh and now i just tell people that it 's the pilot alphabet 
 tl dr in soviet <unk> url types you 
 i spent at least half an hour trouble shooting a customer 's email address over the phone 
 it was so perplexing 
 there was no reason that it should n't be working 
 this guy was in his 20 's so i mistakenly gave him the benefit of the doubt and began looking into more complicated issues 
 everything checked out so i finally got him to spell letter for letter what he was entering as his username only to find out that he was spelling at '' instead of using @ 
 how does one function in today 's society having never used an email address being one of the more tech savvy people along my friends one guy came to me to show off his new computer 
 & gt him : i got a new gaming computer over the break 
 intel <unk> 
 & gt me : oh cool what gpu 
 & gt him : gpu 
 it took him a moment but he remembered 
 with a smile on his face he told me it has an intel hd '' gpu 
 my heart broke as i broke the news to him 
 the classic 
 last year a <unk> died in a <unk> car accident 
 his wife and 2 children were in the car with him when it happened 
 we everyone here at the office promised to support the wife and children in any way we could and i promised free tech support any time she needed it 
 she brought her macbook in for work shortly after the accident for support i cleaned it up and sent her off with a spare external drive so she could do time machine backups of the macbook 
 <unk> <unk> year later* two <unk> ago i received an email from the wife let 's call her sadwife 
 she explained to me that the family imac had stopped working and asked if i could take a look 
 i thought back to the macbook and figured she was just mistakenly calling it an imac so i told her to bring it on in 
 she brought it in 
 it was not the macbook 
 it was an imac and it was ancient late <unk> model 
 she then explained that it <unk> the entire collection of family pictures all of her husbands <unk> projects their legal documents their bills their family video files etc 
 ** anything and everything that had to do with her now dead husband was on this machine 
 irreplaceable stuff and no backups 
 i plugged the sad white <unk> in and turned it on and right away got the folder 
 logo 
 i pressed my ear to the machine and heard the drive 
 <unk> chip <unk> chip chip chip <unk> not wanting to freak sadwife out i told her to leave it with me for a day or two and i would do what i could smiling until she left my office 
 as soon as the door shut the smile disappeared 
 i shut the machine off and pulled the drive docked it to a macbook i had on my shelf and to my relief the drive appeared 
 then to my <unk> the drive disappeared 
 freezer trick 
 failed 
 the drive spun up with no problem and then just chip chip <unk> away not a damaging sound but like the arm was n't receiving instructions from the controller 
 upon examining the controller i found lots of <unk> 
 there were still signs of life since it actually tried to appear when i docked it to the macbook on my desk so i was hopeful 
 i put on my reading glasses and carefully scraped the contacts clean revealing shiny new copper underneath the thin <unk> of <unk> 
 plugged in powered on it appears 
 then disappears 
 <unk> 
 hopeful that i could still save it i started digging through spare machines hoping to find a matching <unk> <unk> drive with the same controller 
 about 5 machines in i found one that looked identical 
 but it was an <unk> model 
 the contacts on this one were also <unk> but not nearly as much and the <unk> drive worked fine 
 hope 
 i took out the soldering iron and moved the ic chip but noticed there were other components which <unk> between the two so i moved those as well 
 plugged in turned on spun up ... nothing 
 & gt <unk> it 
 ** i turned it off and left early for the day as i had to take a day trip out of town the next day 
 while gone i decided that if needed i would just send the thing of for data recovery i even got approval for the cost from <unk> 
 friday morning came and i arrived at the office 
 sadwife had emailed the day before asking if i had any luck 
 i bought some time by telling her i was out of the office and still had more work to do 
 walking into my office which at this point looked like a <unk> the robot kind had exploded in it i looked at the drive in it 's dock 
 i figured why not 
 so i clicked the power button on the dock 
 the thing came to life and started giving healthy drive activity sounds 
 it appeared on the desktop of the macbook and this time it stayed there 
 & gt <unk> crap 
 ** i have a drive <unk> but i did n't dare power it off to disconnect it from the mac so i copied all of her documents videos pictures etc 
 into a folder on the macbook then since it was still alive i grabbed the nearest drive and did a block copy 
 i put the cloned drive in the imac put it back together and powered it up 
 perfect 
 i called sadwife to tell her the news : & gt hi sadwife this is <unk> you can come get your imac 
 i have a spare external drive for you to run time machine backups as well 
 & gt sadwife : how did it go 
 was it too much trouble 
 & gt me : ... no 
 no trouble at all 
 **tl dr : the husband died but i <unk> his data 
 ** <unk> edit : about 50 spelling and grammar mistakes 
 yesterday was a 20 hour day 
 shut up 
 edit2 : gold 
 god i love the people in this sub 
 edit 3 : i love how mod made the front page quote ask a question that is answered by the title just below it 
 thanks <unk> you just made my <unk> is my first tfts post so forgive any errors 
 i frequent a small coffee shop on my lunch hour and have helped the owners out a few times with small computer stuff 
 mostly in exchange for the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> '' when i go there 
 haha 
 anyway i was there today and there was one guy who was watching videos on his iphone 
 which is fine it 's open internet and a public coffee house 
 except when the owner caught my attention when i was headed to the washroom 
 she made the <unk> come here '' nod and i obliged 
 she whispered to me asking if there 's some way to get this guy off the internet because his videos were crazy loud there were a few kids there and he was asked before to use headphones or at least turn it down below the level of the speaker music 
 he did for a while but i guess just decided <unk> the <unk> 
 so i said sure i 'll handle it '' 
 i use the washroom and return to my seat sipping on my coffee 
 i head to the router page which was a default login of course and find a ip address and mac address with the name <unk> '' attached to it 
 sure enough it was the only phone other than a few androids so i <unk> it for a minute and see what happens 
 like magic his videos stops after <unk> 
 <unk> tap <unk> nothing 
 he looks around while i 'm buried in my coffee and he tries a few more taps 
 he checks the wifi password theres a card on each table with it and nothing 
 haha 
 he left shortly after 
 once his car pulled out i removed the mac <unk> so if he comes back he 's ok. she <unk> 'd my coffee and thanked me 
 this is the closest i 've been to a <unk> work for a big company with a global presence hundreds of locations 
 some have onsite it some do n't 
 the department i work for is called rits 
 remote it support 
 if it can be fixed without physical contact we handle it 
 my co-worker gets a call - it goes like this 
 cw : rits - this is co-worker 
 how can i help you 
 caller : there 's a man in here with a gun he 's <unk> up the security guard ... cw : is this a joke 
 what site are you calling from 
 caller : we are at site # <unk> this is not a joke 
 we are being <unk> 
 we need the police 
 somebody else calls the police 
 thankfully nobody was hurt but there was some property damage 
 in the <unk> meeting the caller was interviewed asked why she did n't call the police in the first place 
 because there were and still are signs all over the site that say need help 
 call rits '' 
 i work for a small university as a computer tech and at the start of each semester 90 % of what i do is reset passwords 
 resetting a password is a relatively <unk> process so long as the student <unk> 
 of course this would n't be much of a story had there not been one to do otherwise ... the day started off well though i had n't the chance to eat breakfast that morning 
 so before the <unk> of students arrived i managed to grab a <unk> from the break room and eat it at my desk 
 the student <unk> began shortly after and about 5 or 6 students in line was constant 
 at about mid day my day stopped going so well 
 a student <unk> shouting and pushing her way through the line all the way to my desk 
 she continued shouting at me demanding to know why her login was n't working 
 apparently she needed into her account asap and it was more <unk> than the password problems of all other students in line 
 including the one i had been currently working with 
 rather than escalate the situation i calmly asked her to test her login on my computer before resetting it 
 she looked infuriated that i would dare not take her word for it 
 though thankfully she calmed down a little and proceeded to type in her credentials 
 while typing she growled : if this works i 'm going to flip a lid '' 
 she hits enter and it logs in 
 stunned she went quiet staring at the screen in disbelief 
 in order to quickly escalate the situation without saying a word i slide towards her the lid from my <unk> and i waited for over an hour the wait was bad 
 i thought about if i’d get paid for this if found guilty 
 probably not 
 i eventually <unk> enough courage to get some more coffee 
 screechy followed me over to the tea room 
 & gt screechy : so you think anyone else will talk to us 
 the entire of hr was treating us as if we had the plague 
 it was rather nice 
 & gt me : haha probably not 
 still would you talk to the pair who potentially put a bar through a air - conditioner 
 & gt screechy : i mean… could be a good story 
 i looked down at my coffee 
 it was free 
 worked paid for this 
 was it my last 
 i took a sip 
 the head of hr walked into the break room 
 as she looked at us her face changed to surprise 
 & gt headhr : oh you’re still here 
 & gt me : yep… i didn’t know what to say 
 coffee wasn’t giving me any <unk> either 
 & gt headhr : arn’t you meant to be getting the server back up 
 you know… so work can happen 
 & gt me : no no the vp has banned us from the office 
 he told us to wait up here 
 & gt headhr : oh you haven’t heard 
 & gt me : heard … & gt headhr : well i can’t officially say anything since i’m head of hr but you can definitely go back to work now 
 & gt me : no 
 wait 
 what 
 & gt headhr : hurry downstairs and fix these computers that 's all can officially say 
 as i headed downstairs i wondered what had just happened my coffee wasn’t giving anything away 
 upon reaching the it floor i notice techs madly working to get the servers up again 
 colourblind sees me walk in and rushes over 
 & gt colourblind : airz 
 thank goodness we’ve restored almost all the services but salesmanager keeps ringing up and saying how slow everything is can you deal with it 
 & gt me : no problem 
 i walked into my office and picked up the phone to call the sales manager 
 & gt me : hey its airz down in it… 
 it was at that point that the vp arrived at my office 
 i just pressed the hangup button 
 he looked at me rather sheepishly 
 & gt vp : sorry… 
 i was confused 
 it had been a <unk> morning 
 i may have also wanted to milk it 
 & gt me : for 
 & gt vp : for <unk> a few things 
 & gt me : you mean accusing me of sabotage 
 type things 
 & gt vp : we had a er… misunderstanding 
 for that i apologize 
 he looked defeated 
 it was glorious 
 my coffee was empty 
 but i was happy 
 & gt vp : in compensation for your stressful morning i think perhaps we should cancel the audit 
 the department is stressed enough 
 & gt me : two auditors in two days 
 i really know how to get rid of them 
 & gt vp : errr… 
 yes 
 also you’ll probably need a bigger budget to cover all the lost equipment 
 & gt me : we did lose quite a bit 
 & gt vp : yes i think i’ll just get out of your way… over the next day we brought more of the equipment from the heated room online most of it was working however the budget situation had gone from one extreme to the other so most of the equipment needed <unk> 
 the office rumor <unk> was running in overtime about what had happened however no one would speak to me about it until finally i caught youngsec alone 
 & gt me : so youngsec do you know what happened to the air <unk> 
 & gt youngsec : you didn’t hear 
 after you and screechy disappeared the police arrived and one of the office workers from the building opposite the fan <unk> 
 & gt me : did he say why he did it 
 & gt youngsec : apparently when the silver fan is moving at speed the reflection from the sun was flashing and hitting him in the eyes as he worked 
 & gt me : so he decided to destroy it 
 & gt youngsec : no no he didn’t think it would break the thing just tried to get it to stop flashing 
 kinda of like when you turn off the fan in the car the air conditioner still <unk> just doesn’t push it out as much 
 & gt me : air <unk> need <unk> & gt youngsec : are you sure … 
 after i’d found out what had really happened i was quite pleased 
 i sat down at my computer and picked up my coffee 
 time to check some emails 
 & gt new message & gt <unk> we get some more keyboards on level two 
 we’re running really low again **** & gt sales manager 
 i looked down at my coffee 
 i took a sip 
 tastes the same 
 the battle was over the vp settled down for a few months after that 
 a few minor fights but nothing really kicked off again until the new security head finally arrived 
 thank you all for reading : this is the end of the first vp war 
 next i didn’t skip too much outside of the occasional story that violated rules 7 or <unk> 
 a friend of mine has also been working in it and just got hired to do soul crushing data entry 
 i 'm a big security <unk> so i asked him if his company ever had a security audit done and if not he should let his boss know i can do it 
 his boss gave me a call and we could n't settle on price 
 my friend let me know later that day that on the weekend a different company is coming in for physical security 
 it coworkers of my friend and myself are invited to watch the process from security cameras and being the security <unk> that i am i decided to come in and watch 
 on saturday around noon i showed up to find my friend in the security room with the 2 guards for the company watching the cameras 
 & gt me : where is everyone 
 i thought this was going to be a big deal 
 you do n't get to watch pros break in to companies every day 
 & gt friend : ya i brought beer though we 're not sure what time they 're coming in 
 it 's supposed to be a surprise i think 
 & gt 2 guards : <unk> around raises glass of beer turns back to <unk> after chatting for about an hour we notice a homeless man hanging around the back door asking for change and getting in to peoples faces as they leave the building 
 we do n't think much of it at the time 
 to spoil the surprise he 's stealing rfid information from employee 's cards 
 we 're distracted by a well dressed person at the side door that keeps juggling his phone starbucks mcdonalds bag and keyring at one of our doors 
 he keeps <unk> down to put things on the ground <unk> the order of how he 's holding things then stands back up in front of the lock 
 this starts my friend and i talking about what he could be doing why they chose that get up why they 're pretending to be on the phone etc 
 at about <unk> the homeless man and the well dressed man both leave and get out of view of the cameras 
 we keep talking and expect a long wait before something else happens but at about <unk> the well dressed man comes back to the door he was fiddling with before and takes out a key 
 he slips it in to the lock and unlocks the door 
 security at this point is absolutely floored 
 to again spoil the surprise he was doing an <unk> attack 
 since it and security and myself were in on the test we 're not allowed to <unk> 
 we keep our eyes on the monitor and watch that man casually walk to the server room and lift his mcdonalds bag in front of the scanner 
 the light turns green and he walks past the authorized <unk> 
 the 2 guards are totally speechless and my friend and i are absolutely amazed 
 he 's one more set of doors away from a 200+ million dollar server room 
 he lifts his mcdonalds bag in front of the scanner for the last set but the light turns red 
 <unk> he <unk> down and turns on the light on his smartphone and points it under the door 
 then he stands back up and literally starts pissing in between the doors 
 & gt guard a : he did not just do that 
 & gt friend : did he just break in to our servers by potentially causing millions of dollars in water damage 
 the doors open due to the sensors on the other side picking up either the weight or the movement he casually picks up his phone and walks into the server room 
 he picks up the phone calls the boss and lets him know the <unk> test was successful 
 i guess this is why some auditors want to get paid before they do the test 
 next time though i hope they go with the more expensive security auditors they might not get their servers water damaged 
 <unk> tl dr - multi-million dollar security doors that <unk> let people walk out by automatically opening from inside movement can be opened by literally pissing through the crack between the doors 
 back when i first started doing it work i was techsupport for xyz bank 
 easy job nothing too crazy 
 the <unk> did you try turning the machine on '' was half my calls '' 
 anyways one day a branch calls complaining that their fax machine was n't working two middle-aged women 
 after confirming all the cables were connected and the device was on i tried a test fax 
 & gt bank teller1 : we 're out of paper 
 can you fax us a few <unk> 
 & gt me : haha that 's pretty funny 
 & gt bank teller1 : no really we 're out of paper 
 just send us some 
 & gt teller2 in background : i still ca n't find anymore paper ask him to fax some more over 
 & gt me : ma'am i 'm sorry it does n't work that way 
 the fax <unk> send paper its just a copy 
 & gt teller1 : no techsupport has done it before 
 just fax a blank page 
 & gt teller2 : wait ca n't we just make more paper from the printer 
 & gt teller1 : i 've tried that already too 
 it 's not working either 
 by this time the bank managers comes in and wants to know whats going on 
 i hear the <unk> explaining everything 
 & gt bank manager : well just have him fax some more 
 they 've done it before 
 & gt me : ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... & gt teller2 : i got some paper 
 i just made copies from the back blank side of an older fax 
 & gt me : ... ... wow ... <unk> ... ok. add on : later i found out from some co-workers that the branch was known for not being too tech savvy and at some point my team started messing with them 
 i promise this story is 100 % real 
 glad everyone liked it 
 i have dozens of stories like this and i 'd be happy to post some more later 
 thanks again for all the upvotes 
 i do tech support for my father 's business 
 he has a single windows server which hosts his databases file and print shares 
 there was a big electrical storm the previous night and he shut it down during the storm to make sure it was safe 
 the next day he turned it back on again 
 he called me at work to explain that he could n't access his server after it was turned back on 
 so he held the power button down for 5 seconds until it powered off turned it on again waited and still could n't access the server 
 he did this 5 times before calling me 
 i was audibly annoyed by this point and explained that his server is n't like a dvd player 
 you ca n't just <unk> the power from it for the fun of it 
 i opened team viewer and could see their server in my list 
 i connected to it and despite the abuse it has been through it seemed to be working 
 he said he still could n't access the file shares despite this so i connected to his laptop 
 sure enough he could n't 
 i looked at his wireless adapter and he was <unk> to his mobile phone ... was n't even connected to the right wifi network 
 to make things worse there 's two other computers in the room and they were working just fine 
 he killed the power to the business server 5 times because he was connected to the wrong network 
 <unk> i had a guy come in saying that his laptop keyboard was n't working because his wife had spilled something on it 
 he was a real <unk> type 
 <unk> hat unshaven <unk> jacket <unk> and a big plug of <unk> in his lip 
 i told him that his keyboard more than likely <unk> out and needed a replacement 
 i pulled his keyboard and saw that there was still quite a bit of moisture underneath it to the point of where the keyboard actually dripped 
 i <unk> it off with paper towels 
 i had a few concerns so i gave him a call 
 & gt q : hi mr. x this is q with computer company 
 & gt x : sure what can i do for you 
 & gt q : after removing your keyboard i noticed that there was still quite a bit of moisture underneath it and i wanted to make you aware that there 's a possibility it could affect your computer further 
 & gt x : like more than the keyboard 
 & gt q : yes sir 
 & gt x : <unk> 
 i did n't think there was that much in my spit cup 
 i realized on that day that there is not enough hand <unk> in the <unk> 's a tale from awhile back 
 user walks up to my desk while i 'm in the middle of correcting a major configuration error on imaging software that we use for <unk> while they perform surgery 
 i 'm the only it left in the office at this point 
 **user : ** <unk> i need you to fix my <unk> 
 it 's not displaying the correct name on a form i 'm trying to create 
 **me focused intently on my screen : ** i 'm a tad busy here 
 go ahead and submit a ticket and i 'll get to it later on today 
 **user : ** well it 's really important to my workflow that i have the correct name and ... long winded explanation for why her minor form error requires immediate attention from me with no regard whatsoever for the fact that i 'm <unk> ignoring her 
 **me still not looking away from my monitor : ** uh huh that 's all well and good but i really am <unk> right now and i really really need to focus on this project here 
 just submit a ticket and we 'll get it handled asap 
 user continues to <unk> <unk> 
 about the issue they 're having and basically become a fly in my ear 
 it goes on for literally around seven and a half minutes a lifetime if you 're trying to focus on something important and does n't seem to be <unk> down 
 at this point i 'm just finishing the configuration but i decide i 've had enough 
 i 've tried twice to politely but firmly let this user know i was occupied along with the proper protocols for requesting my assistance 
 i should mention i have a blue <unk> headset plugged into my ear 
 **me : ** <unk> 
 pointing up to the bluetooth yes doctor 
 pause oh ... oh my god i 'm so sorry 
 the patient died 
 i ... i tried to get your images as quickly as i could i <unk> ... i was distracted i make direct eye contact with the user who at this point has gone white 
 another pause as i look back at my screen i understand 
 i 'm so so so sorry 
 **user : ** shocked silence **me : ** shaking it off and hanging up '' my headset i look back at the user well it looks like my afternoon opened up 
 what did you you say you needed again 
 the user made an excuse and hurried away and from that point always submitted support tickets through the proper channels 
 **edit** for those who are concerned yes i did inform the user later that no one *actually* died 
 as i 've written before i 'm currently studying nights on top of my day job 
 very recently the classroom lost it 's access to the internet 
 we use tablets and despite the teacher resetting the modem and router we were offline 
 & gt teacher : uhm okay we 'll do without i guess ... well i did n't plan for this no other material on hand 
 we 'll discuss the material seen so far and i 'll take questions ... '' why they keep their material on <unk> instead of locally i 'll never know but i already had pulled out my phone and logged on the remote work tools the telco provides me confirming that the node was down possibly for up to three hours 
 so i set up a wifi hotspot 
 call it a professional <unk> i ca n't be in a room with no internet and not fix it ... & gt bytewave : actually we can be online in seconds 
 if everyone goes to settings wifi and pick the first connection top of the list <unk> '' you 'll have internet '' 
 big mistake 
 this is a <unk> class i forgot one second everyone around me are mere users when it comes to tech 
 & gt <unk> : settings 
 is that in the yellow green and red circle with a smaller blue circle in it '' 
 & gt <unk> : why are you lying the teacher unplugged the router it ca n't work '' 
 & gt <unk> : i do n't have settings do you mean <unk> and <unk> '' 
 & gt studentd : guys it 's actually working 
 i have ... '' & gt <unk> : why are you lying too it 's unplugged '' 
 & gt <unk> : why is this broken it 's a brand new tablet 
 this was 500 $ '' 
 & gt <unk> : it says something about blue <unk> '' 
 <unk> 
 * & gt bytewave : i 'm sorry my instructions were overly confusing 
 please stay on the uni 's wifi 
 i 'll just <unk> my phone to that computer to use as gateway and bridge the wireless and the ethernet adapters together 
 it 'll be far less trouble this way ... '' the room looks at me in <unk> with only studentd and the teacher understanding what i was doing - <unk> 
 minute or two later we 're back online 
 & gt bytewave : there 
 just open your browser '' 
 *looks at <unk> & gt bytewave : just to be on the safe side - i mean the yellow green and red circle with a smaller blue circle in it '' 
 ... all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 so some things are too good not to share 
 some things are too good not to share immediately 
 my colleague just spoke to a user who as the main part of her job scans passports and other documents to put on file in a database 
 simple enough right 
 wrong 
 she had called up because in the past she had been scanning in <unk> at our <unk> printers opening the resulting pdf on her computer and printing it with <unk> to save it where she wanted it to go 
 however the version we have <unk> is a bit out of date and following an update to <unk> she is no longer able to do this 
 my colleague had to spend 5 minutes explaining that you do n't need to convert a file to a pdf when it 's already a pdf 
 she eventually got it and said she panicked because she had <unk> <unk> the paper copies 
 & gt <unk> : ... you shred the passports 
 & gt **user** : no the photocopies 
 she had been <unk> documents scanning the photocopies at the same machine once they came out opening the scanned document a .pdf and then converting it to a .pdf in a different location 
 after my colleague finished his explanation i think he actually <unk> her working day 
 *edit* formatting previous monday afternoon i had been set with the task of ensuring hr had changed their password to something secure 
 i was <unk> the job 
 hr personnel seemed to be immune to the usual request 
 working in hr somehow made then think they were above the … law 
 i sipped my coffee like mad trying to think of a way to phrase my request 
 nothing came to mind 
 after ten minutes of furious sipping my email was still blank 
 my head flopped down on my desk 
 it was useless 
 the hr manager had told me it would be hard but this was impossible 
 a knock at the door made my head look up 
 it was redcheer 
 & gt redcheer : you look… like you’re in trouble 
 need some help 
 & gt me : i have to get hr to change their passwords to something actually secure and not write them down 
 its impossible 
 the red haired lady looked thoughtful for a second then her eyes lit up brightly 
 & gt redcheer : i’ve an idea… wan na try good cop bad cop 
 my mouth instinctively made a no shape but before any sounds could get out i looked at my blank <unk> & gt me : i guess its worth a try 
 ***** walking upto hr redcheer insisted she be good cop 
 arriving at <unk> desk hrsad looked up at <unk> with confusion 
 & gt redcheer : hello 
 we’re from it 
 we where wondering if you’d change your password for login 
 & gt hrsad : i already have 
 that was easy 
 hrsad smiled at redcheer he seemed eager to continue the conversation with redcheer 
 & gt me : would you mind logging off for a second 
 hrsad did so but didn’t reply 
 he was busy trying to think of what to say to redcheer 
 i looked at the keyboard and typed in penelope5 
 wrong password 
 i typed in penelope05 
 access granted 
 & gt me : okay hrsad we’re gon na need you to make it more secure then penelope05 
 hrsad looked angry 
 & gt hrsad : no 
 i can remember that password 
 if i forget it others can remember too 
 redcheer mouthed at me <unk> <unk> 
 & gt me : listen you little punk 
 your computer has access to information bad people wouldn’t mind getting their hands on 
 & gt redcheer : if you just change it to something not everyone knows i’ll be happy 
 redcheer smiled at him he looked at us confusedly 
 & gt hrsad : but… & gt me : bank info of every employee birthdays and performance reviews 
 all accessible through that password 
 are you so insane you can’t see how it would be important to secure it 
 & gt redcheer : changing it to something only you’ll remember is easy 
 i opened my mouth to start again but hrsad was too busy staring into redcheers eyes 
 & gt hrsad : you’ll help me come up with a secure … 
 & gt redcheer : sure 
 my mind screamed at me to say no but i was too bored of hrsad 
 plus its redcheer… who cares if she knows a hr password 
 ***** as we moved to our second target redcheer gave me a rundown on my performance as bad cop 
 & gt redcheer : maybe <unk> it up a <unk> maybe to eleven 
 & gt me : err… & gt redcheer : put some real fear into them 
 we rounded on our second target who sat at a desk surrounded by purple 
 & gt redcheer : hey we’re from it 
 can we get you to change your password to something secure 
 & gt purplehr : don’t worry 
 i already have 
 i smiled until i saw her screen 
 about four separate <unk> notes with her <unk> password 
 & gt me : you’re gon na have to change it again and not write it down 
 & gt purplehr : but everyone here knows each others password 
 & gt me : wha… **why 
 ** i was getting a little angry 
 i could feel my bad cop building up… & gt purplehr : it’s easier 
 & gt redcheer : maybe just change your password to something no one knows 
 easy 
 & gt purplehr : no 
 redcheer mouthed bad cop '' again 
 & gt me : <unk> you 
 security is your responsibility 
 if my identity gets stolen and i’m sitting in a police station trying to prove to them i didn’t take out a hundred credit cards will you come and save me 
 **no** 
 and why i know that 
 i paused and glared down at her 
 she looked up at me wide eyed 
 & gt me : because you are so lazy you couldn’t even remember 10 characters without telling everyone in the f & amp $ % ing office 
 so when i’m sitting at that police station and some criminal is off using the credentials stolen from your computer to rack up debts in my name do you know who i’ll be telling the police to arrest 
 a second pause to catch my breath 
 redcheer was smiling purplehr looked a mix of fear concern pain and broken <unk> 
 & gt me : f @ % $ ing you 
 for <unk> the criminal my identity 
 & gt redcheer : changing your password is very <unk> purplehr just started nodding 
 she seemed oddly compliant 
 i smiled as redcheer helped purplehr set her password 
 ***** walking away redcheer gave me a thumbs up 
 & gt redcheer : that was great 
 can i be bad cop next time 
 & gt me : <unk> internally however i wasn’t sure 
 bad cop was out of his <unk> 
 next warning : the word cpu will be used 
 there 's a doctor who must have the best of the best 
 i feel like sometimes he <unk> the net reads what folks just bought and goes dammit i want that shit too '' 
 my hospital at the time barely had windows 7 images 
 it was n't a priority and you had to justify needing 7. plus key software that the doctors used were only capable <unk> in our environment as the hospital was holding off from buying packages that supported 7. this great doctor who understood everything but did n't care once asked me about upgrading his computer 
 i informed him ... your os is xp so you 're capped realistically when it comes to ram 
 the system wo n't recognize it and your programs are n't resource heavy for a win 7 machine <unk> ram 
 he went over my head and demanded from my super that he has a machine that has <unk> of ram 
 no 32 
 he wanted 32 ... <unk> ... <unk> 
 he was on the <unk> of obtaining it too even going as high up as the vp of is 
 my supervisor ever so <unk> about this told us all to avoid the doctor for a week if possible and said she 'd handle this 
 she pulled a desktop off the shelf that was already imaged and walked it over to him and installed it for him 
 a week later the doctor sees me and he 's overjoyed 
 the new cpu he said it 's fast 
 really fast 
 since he was nearby it he showed me the specs in the system properties 
 the ram installed was <unk> 
 he was reading this as <unk> he thought my supervisor must have put in a <unk> <unk> of ram and the video card was reducing the ram 
 nobody ever told him about what was really under that chassis and he never asked my supervisor for anything computer related as long as i was in hardware support i 'm guessing he finally figured out exactly what happened and his <unk> prevented him from being angered to note there was a hardware support position that was available where you got ta be a paid <unk> for the doctors and admin ... .and strong rumor is that the doctor demanded it be created because he wanted someone to build him a computer while he was at home so he could do his work on it 
 i bet he finally got that 32gb of ram so he could <unk> on patients ... disclaimer : i 'm new to this job so some information might be faulty 
 everything in this post really happened though 
 i work for one of the biggest healthcare software providers in our country 
 i work at the <unk> line service center 
 a few weeks ago we get an email from one of our bigger customers : our online client dossier system isnt working 
 please fix '' 
 our team gets on it as far as i understand it clearing the cache on their server fixed the problem 
 temporarily 
 the following 3-4 days we get the same call every day 
 we try something new every day but end up clearing the cache again and again 
 until at some point we get a call again : we will send over a manager put together a team and lets fix this <unk> once and for all '' 
 so my colleague who 's the escalation manager and in charge of communication with the team and with the customer puts together a 7 headed team 
 mind you these people cost <unk> an hour for our customer 
 the manager arrives and they get to work 
 they spend the entire afternoon 10am - 4pm trying to fix this issue 
 clearing the cache changing settings 
 every time after about 40 minutes the system crashes again 
 at some point 2 more developers join the fun 
 in total these 9 people spent ~50 hours on this issue 
 at the end of the day they give up and try one last resort : let 's just ... reset the server ... '' and guess what 
 the service is working like a charm and no issues ever since 
 when i heard my colleague 's story i facepalmed and asked : why did they not do this first and <unk> looked at other solutions '' 
 he replied : in hindsight that may have been a smart move 
 yes '' 
 we had a good laugh 
 tl dr : 9 people spent 50 hours to basically turn it off and back on again 
 edit for some faq : 1 : no the customer did not get charged the full amount 
 they have a service level agreement that says they have a right to a certain amount of service in certain situations 
 2 : yes there is an underlying problem that needs to be solved and that they are looking at now 
 but at least the server seems to be stable now 
 3 : note that the system is hosted on our customer 's servers 
 not our own 
 the fault most likely lies in their server not in our service though nothing <unk> has come from any of the tests yet 
 most of our customers make use of this service and none of them have experienced any issue like this in the past 5 - 10 years 
 4 : no i do not work for epic 
 no i 'm not going to tell you where i do work 
 previous sitting down who knew how amazing a real chair is only when you’ve been sitting on asphalt do you remember 
 poor chairs never getting enough credit 
 the vp sat down behind his desk he put his hands together 
 i wasn’t sure if he was going for the evil <unk> look but he achieved it 
 the head of hr sat down next to me after closing the door 
 & gt vp : so airz let us continue 
 what have you got to say about this pattern of incompetence 
 & gt headhr : sorry what pattern 
 & gt vp : i’m fairly sure it hasn’t done any work for almost an entire day 
 got anything to say about it airz 
 & gt me : i’m still not feeling great can’t i just use the bathroom 
 the vp shook his head he wasn’t letting anything leave his sight 
 i looked longingly over at the bathroom 
 & gt headhr : show me the evidence while airz goes to the bathroom quickly 
 the vp opened up the ticket queue and leaned back in his chair smiling 
 i got up from my chair staring at my <unk> the bathroom 
 & gt vp : you can’t go to that bathroom till you’ve answered why the queue looks like this 
 i sat back down and looked at the main queue for it 
 i was expecting to see a mess of tickets 
 & gt headhr : three tickets are in the queue 
 & gt vp : wait what 
 that can’t be right 
 the head of hr wasn’t wrong 
 three tickets lay in the queue 
 only three 
 & gt vp : what the hell is going on 
 people have been <unk> & gt headhr : people always complain 
 & gt vp : oh i know lets look at the average time of <unk> for the past day 
 it’ll be way above normal 
 the vp opened up the average time charts 
 <unk> errors everywhere 
 & gt vp : why isn’t this opening 
 whats happening 
 the phone started ringing 
 the vp was annoyed put the phone on speaker and screamed hello 
 & gt vp : hello 
 & gt bigp : why the hell are you screaming 
 & gt vp : oh its you 
 hello boss 
 sorry about that 
 & gt bigp : what the hell is wrong with you 
 the president bellowed into the phone i was fairly sure even other floors could hear him screaming through it 
 even i looked up from dreaming about the bathroom 
 & gt vp : wha 
 & gt bigp : a fire drill shuts down the company for two whole hours 
 & gt vp : about that… the vp didn’t look much like an evil genius anymore 
 & gt bigp : how is it possible that someone could marshal a fire drill for so long anyway 
 it shouldn’t even take three minutes to get everyone outside 
 & gt vp : well yes but after they are <unk> 
 the president cut the vp off mid sentence 
 he really wasn’t happy 
 & gt bigp : so you agree it only takes three minutes to get outside 
 well imagine my surprise when someone told me part of the reason that the fire drill took so long was that the fire marshal himself took twenty f % & amp $ ing minutes to get outside 
 i looked over at the vp’s desk i saw my coffee i’d left earlier 
 & gt vp : but i didn’t know it was coming 
 & gt bigp : oh that fills me with confidence 
 so the company will be okay in a real fire just so long as we warn you beforehand that its coming 
 & gt vp : i er… 
 i picked up my coffee cup 
 i smiled 
 this was almost fun 
 & gt bigp : not only that but i hear it didn’t even have an alarm 
 & gt vp : i think they disabled it 
 & gt bigp : who the f* % $ would disable a fire alarm 
 i don’t want health and safety <unk> all over this place 
 how is it you can’t even get the simplest <unk> 
 it was at this point i decided to take a sip of my three hour old coffee 
 it was cold but i wanted something to <unk> my stomach 
 mistake 
 <unk> headhr : <unk> 
 & gt bigp : what the hell was that sound 
 & gt vp : airz just threw up 
 go to the bathroom airz 
 i was still feeling sick but i really wanted to listen to this phone call 
 & gt me : i think i’m okay 
 like you said i can wait till we’ve been through the three ticket long queue 
 shouldn’t take long 
 & gt bigp : why the hell is there a sick it manager in your office 
 & gt vp : well… 
 we were having a <unk> & gt bigp : oh shut it vp 
 airz go to the bathroom come back when you’re feeling better 
 i wasn’t happy i couldn’t witness the rest of the conversation 
 i sat in the bathroom for a minute or two 
 <unk> some water on my face 
 i started feeling better 
 i made my way back into the vp’s office 
 & gt vp : okay sorry again boss 
 & gt bigp : is that airz i hear coming back 
 & gt me : hey president sorry about that 
 i looked down at the cold coffee sitting on the vp’s desk 
 it was surrounded by sick 
 the smell was bad 
 i decided against taking another sip 
 & gt me : i should probably start cleaning this all up… 
 & gt bigp : don’t worry about that 
 i hear you’ve had a stressful morning 
 well lucky for you… you’ve won the free week off 
 & gt me : i ... what 
 & gt bigp : one paid week off 
 you won 
 congratulations 
 i was confused 
 what was happening 
 & gt me : oh thanks 
 next week off 
 & gt bigp : don’t mention it 
 oh no not next week it has to be the week after 
 however i do need a <unk> & gt me : sure what do you need 
 i looked around at the other people in the office 
 head of hr was currently holding her nose because of the smell of sick 
 & gt bigp : don’t worry we’ll discuss it later 
 you better get back to those what was it <unk> three tickets 
 go fix them now ... i took that as a sign to leave 
 in my grasp a week off and not having to clean up <unk> 
 odd that not having to clean up sick counted as a win 
 still… 
 win 
 next started a job at help desk a few years ago 
 i was new so i expected them to have me do something dumb at first to trick me 
 boss calls me in his office he is a bit serious and very business man like 
 can you please order us a left handed keyboard '' 
 me : uhm 
 <unk> no 
 him : 
 uh yeah 
 i need one for another user 
 me : yeah i 'm not an idiot i 'm not gon na fall for that one 
 him : *looks <unk> i never said you were an idiot ... and fall for what 
 i just need you to order us one 
 please 
 me : hah yeah okay 
 a week goes by 
 my boss calls me in again and is wondering where the key board is 
 i told him i 'm not an idiot there is no such thing as a left handed keyboard 
 he holds up his key board 
 the number pad was on the opposite side 
 it was a fucking left handed keyboard 
 i was embarrassed ordered it and ended up leaving short afterwards 
 edit : edited grammar 
 also edited out gender <unk> that reveal my gender because i guess it <unk> people since it 's unnecessary 
 way back when i was a <unk> for this soul crushing payday loan <unk> but whatever i took their money 
 i was helpdesk 
 its aint <unk> and it aint pretty but its a good start i get a call <unk> @ helpdesk ” “yah i 'm a <unk> <unk> 
 we do n't get customer calls 
 ever 
 theres a different number and department for that sort of thing 
 were the people that you call when the store 's server goes down 
 when the internet is n't working 
 the few the <unk> the helpdesk 
 we do n't talk to customers <unk> ... <unk> cust “yah i need to talk to your manager or <unk> il “may i ask ... why ” <unk> i want to talk with them about setting up a new program 
 a program for silver or gold members that do n't have to have their cheques <unk> il <unk> thats a great idea but that is never going to <unk> cust “what 
 why 
 the customer is always right ” il <unk> your idea is gold 
 but this is n't me 
 you called the tech support line 
 i fix monitors i fix computers i do n't do operations or idea 's 
 its like asking a car mechanic to do you taxes a favourite <unk> of mine cust “well then i want to speak with your manager ” il <unk> never going to happen 
 if i put you through to my boss i 'm going to get yelled at 
 your not a store or an employee your not tech support 
 if i escalated this as a ticket the lady who i assume was nice enough to give you this number is going to get yelled at probably fired 
 you 're not supposed to have this number 
 this is for $ <unk> tech problems 
 cust “oh ... <unk> il “if you really like your idea and it seems like an alright idea 
 but again i do n't know good ideas from the bad 
 you go back to the store and you ask to speak with the district manager 
 thats a different kettle of fish and they like ideas like <unk> cust <unk> i 'll try <unk> i never got in trouble for that call 
 that idea never came about 
 what i did do was call that same district manager and let them know a csr gave out the helpdesk number i never said which csr or even their store and that maybe the <unk> should handle this internally 
 a couple of weeks ago a friend of mine dual booted windows on his macbook 
 about a week later he called me to say that it was running slowly and even though i 've been using linux for the past two years i agreed to take a look at it 
 an inspection revealed quite a bit of adware but nothing serious 
 not wanting to make any modifications without his permission i had the following conversation with him : & gt me : so there 's a bunch of adware on your computer but i can clean it up 
 & gt him : what 
 macs do n't get adware spyware or viruses 
 & gt me : it 's true that macs are less <unk> to viruses than windows pcs but the fact that you dual booted with windows means - & gt him : <unk> me <unk> macs do n't get viruses 
 what the hell man i thought you were good with computers 
 the conversation continued in this manner for quite a while 
 when i realised that it was like banging my head against a brick wall i left and returned to the safe world of linux 
 edit : fixed an <unk> i work at a public library as tech support 
 i 'm currently setting up databases and stuff for them because they are mainly paper based but i <unk> 
 this old guy called the front desk for tech support at around 9am i had just got in and said that his mouse was n't working 
 so i went all the way up to the third floor and the guy was on the floor using the mouse on the carpet 
 he did n't understand that you just need to lift the mouse and place it at the centre of the mouse <unk> to have room to <unk> so he just kept going off the desk until he was on the floor 
 i did n't laugh because he was clearly very new to computers but it was pretty hilarious 
 i had to sit down with him for a few minutes to explain how it worked and to help him send an email 
 i found the whole thing pretty <unk> as cheesy as that <unk> : i work for a manufacturer booking in engineer visits 
 we recently released a product recall and a dedicated phone line to help those customers 
 unfortunately that line is currently at maximum <unk> and we have <unk> customers calling customer service 
 late in the afternoon during a rather busy spell i get this call : & gt me : good afternoon chargeable repairs how can i help 
 & gt customer : hello i 've pressed the wrong option on the phone because i ca n't get through to ongoing repairs 
 & gt me : okay i 'm sorry you ca n't get through but we do n't deal with ongoing calls in this department we deal with paid for repairs so i will have to try and transfer you 
 & gt customer : that 's ridiculous how come the other line is so busy 
 & gt me : because people who ca n't get through to the recall line are pressing the wrong option to get through to someone 
 & gt customer : why are they doing that 
 they should n't be doing that 
 & gt me : is n't that what you 've just done 
 & gt customer : ... *hangs up* i get many calls where they say they 've pressed the wrong option but never had someone who thinks its okay for them but not for anyone else 
 this tale is n't really about tech support in the computer sense 
 it 's more about engineering support and a very expensive mistake 
 i hope it fits in this subreddit - i 'm sure someone will let me know if it does n't 
 i work on a ship 
 we travel around the world doing things that a ship does in order to make money for the owner 
 normally we can expect to be at sea for at least a month at a time before calling into a port which is nice actually 
 being out at sea miles from anywhere is quite an experience 
 i 've lost track of the number of times i 've crossed the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> 
 anyhow one of the bits of kit that we have on board which is very important for the operation of the <unk> is the water maker 
 i 'm sure you can imagine fresh water is important at sea for such essential things as drinking <unk> laundry cooking and of course technical water to keep the engines <unk> off and other such requirements 
 our water maker is known as a reverse <unk> device 
 it works by using a high pressure pump to force sea water through a <unk> with holes in it that are too small for the salt <unk> to pass through 
 with enough pressure you get fresh water coming out the other side 
 the problem is these membranes are somewhat expensive 
 for our plant which is quite small at about 1 <unk> you would n't see much change from $ <unk> 
 the membranes are somewhat finicky and never identical either 
 one set will operate at a slightly different pressure to another set and the pressure will vary throughout their lifetime too - so you need to vary the pressure in operation to get the right flow rate 
 they also have a very short shelf life so can not be stored on board waiting to be fitted 
 they must be ordered <unk> from the manufacturer 
 my boss the chief engineer is a complete douche <unk> to borrow a term from reddit 
 how he got to his position is a complete mystery 
 endless stupid mistakes unable to add up simple numbers and a complete lack of knowledge for his chosen profession 
 it really is a testament to the rest of the crew that we were able to run the ship quite so effectively while he was in charge '' 
 anyhow one set of these membranes reached the end of their useful working life 
 a new set was ordered arrived on board and was fitted 
 they worked for about a week before the fresh water rate dropped off to near zero 
 douche <unk> contacts the office and informs them that the new set of membranes are <unk> 
 a bit of back and forth with the office and the manufacturer who wo n't accept them back as they 've been used and the office eventually very <unk> agree to buy a new set 
 of course this new set is now on a rush order so not only has the price gone up but they 're also being <unk> on a <unk> plane to meet the ship at the next port 
 we 're up to over $ <unk> here 
 this has all happened whilst i 'm off the ship on leave and coincidentally i join the ship at the next port 
 i 'm caught up on the saga of the membranes and i ask the simple question : & gt have you tried increasing the pressure 
 i bring your attention back to the operating condition of these membranes - it changes in service 
 you need to increase the pressure through the service life to keep the fresh water flowing 
 & gt dc : no 
 why would i do that 
 the old ones worked perfectly well at this pressure 
 along with another crew member i go and look at this plant 
 the pressure has n't been increased from the previous membranes setting 
 it even states in the manual that the pressure settings will vary between sets of membranes 
 i 'm sure you can see where this is going by now 
 i <unk> the pressure knob about half a turn clockwise 
 the pressure <unk> from 45 to 50 bar and sweet fresh water starts to flow just as the new set of membranes arrives on board 
 so these brand new $ <unk> membranes go on the shelf never to be used 
 after a few months we confirm that they 've gone bad and go in the <unk> worked in a small it company of 5 people which ironically there was 2 techs one which is the **boss** who thinks he knows all but is a dangerous user at best myself **the <unk> and for some reason i have never worked out 3 office girls which all did individual jobs as for some reason one person answering the phone doing payroll and making sure invoices are correct and sent out is two difficult for one monkey sorry semi intelligent person to perform 
 & amp nbsp i should also mention we are in a very small town of <unk> people max and live about an hour from a town of any decent size and shops with equipment when needed 
 & amp nbsp <unk> start this fun story 
 ** & amp nbsp it had been a quite week and i had been able to catch up on all my paperwork <unk> had been and had got the last few jobs out the door and was looking at the clock <unk> all the things the weekend might hold when i was interrupted by the boss 
 & amp nbsp **boss** - i need you to pop over to our biggest customers location and run a few network cables and when you have finished you can start your weekend 
 & amp nbsp early finish on a friday before a lovely sunny weekend this is gon na be awesome 
 but then my logical side of my brain kicks in ahh crap what 's the catch or what have i not been told about & amp nbsp **me** - sure thing i will just grab my tools and head over do i need to take anything with me 
 cables etc. 
 **boss** - no no they have everything <unk> us when your done and see you monday 
 **me** - so with a hop in my step and a grin on my face out the door i go for a i thought simple job before relaxing weekend & amp nbsp should be about here you can all see a ahh crap moment coming 
 & amp nbsp so i arrive at customers location all of <unk> down the road sign in and make my way to owner 
 & amp nbsp **me** - i hear you have some network cables to run and you have everything 
 **owner** - yes ... well are you going to do the other things as well or just run the cables 
 & amp nbsp at this point the hop in my step had gone and a very bad sinking feeling was in the pit of my stomach & amp nbsp **me** - what other things 
 hoping for a very simple answer **owner** - well you know how we asked you last year how we want to expand our business and build a new building 
 & amp nbsp i now felt sick inside and could start seeing this as not a simple job & amp nbsp **me** - well yes i heard it mentioned but nothing since 
 **owner** - <unk> really we have been discussing this with your boss since then and we have built the new building and want the new server installed 6 new work stations phone system network etc 
 all connected installed and working for monday when we have our grand opening and he said you can do this weekend 
 & amp nbsp i 'm sure at this point my heart had stopped and i was standing there with the deer in headlights look on my face & amp nbsp **me** - can you say that again i 'm just a bit confused as to what you mean 
 how do you say you have been discussing this for a year this is first i 've heard about it 
 this is not a simple 50 hour job in one weekend to get done but a few weeks or months of planning setting up pcs configuring server etc 
 etc 
 & amp nbsp at this stage i could see the owner confused and a bit worried & amp nbsp **owner** - hang on so your telling me you have not been involved in any of this and have no clue 
 your boss has been emailing us with the last email at 9am this morning saying you 're all set and will be done by sunday night so we can test before we reopen for business monday morning 
 here look at the emails 
 & amp nbsp i 'm sure at this point a part of me died inside i know if you were to check my blood pressure it would kill the machine 
 & amp nbsp **me** - i quickly read the 8 months of email and sure enough there are questions in there and replies of yes i asked <unk> me and he says nothing needs be done before weekend and he has no issues doing in two days 
 & amp nbsp for those of you who have done this you can imagine the amount of work to get this up and going 
 those who have n't imagine running cables terminating <unk> to 4 hours 
 setting up server 8 hours to install and configure 
 setting up work stations 2-3 hours each 
 thing you can see where this is going 
 & amp nbsp **me** - may i use your phone i just need to call boss and get him to come down 
 **owner** - you ok you do n't look to happy 
 **me** - i 'm not sure ... have known the owner for years and am on first name basis but could tell she was worried **me** - boss the simple network job you told me about is nothing to what the emails you have been talking to them about 
 **boss** - they mentioned expanding building and they would <unk> the hardware and we just go down and set it up i do n't see the issue should only take you a day to plug everything in 
 **me** - most polite language and tone i could manage can you please get yourself down here now and discuss this with us 
 & amp nbsp 15 mins pass and boss walks in with coffee in hand and not a care in the world & amp nbsp **me** - so i came here to install network cables as per your request at lunch and arrived here to find a completely different job is required and that you knew about this for a year and signed off on me doing it at 9am this morning 
 **boss** - ahh is that this weekend yes well it should n't take you long to connect the computers and get everything up and going 
 at this point i was trying to think if murder or <unk> would be a lighter sentence than this hell hole he’s landed me in **me** - you have know about this been in discussion with them for 6 months and have told them what machines to order and what they need and have said you asked me and i agreed with the selection of equipment 
 **boss** - yes well everything i told them to get you have sold to home users and they are reliable and have n't had issues 
 & amp nbsp who’s alarms are going off at this stage & amp nbsp **me** - yes to home users single pc who check email surf the net not in a work environment 
 **boss** - does that matter 
 **me** - well i bet you got the stock standard machines 
 please say he changed the os **boss** - yes i just used the previous order and got 6 of the computers 
 **me** - well did you atleast change from windows xp home to professional for the operating system 
 **boss** - no i told the supplier that we did n't need os and we would just use a licence from one of the pc 's already here 
 & amp nbsp now i 'm thinking murder is the best choice ever & amp nbsp **me** - do you know how illegal that is and the issues it would cause for them on so many levels and for us when microsoft ever did spot inspection 
 **boss** - well i did it to there office 2003 home and student and installed on all the pcs and just rang microsoft to activate when the automated activation failed 
 **me** - so you installed a home version not designed for business in any form on 14 plus computers using the same licence key 
 **boss** - yes **me - to <unk> - how much did he charge you she had worried look on face **owner** - he charged us $ <unk> while looking at invoice when he had only supplied one key for a version that could n't be used legally in a business 
 **me - well <unk> there needs to be a huge change and unfortunately i do not think i can do this for you in the time frame i have been given with the equipment i have been given 
 **boss** - i do n't see what the issue is 
 you do what i tell you and i want you to do it now ... **me** - well if that is your stand i do n't think i want to work for you any more especially with the illegal activity you are doing and putting my name on it without my knowledge but still gives me the same issue with microsoft for any legal lawsuits and i will not stand or be thrown under the <unk> for you 
 i quit 
 **boss** - standing in silence looks at owner i will do your computers this weekend for you and get you working 
 & amp nbsp owner who had been standing there watching all this unfold realising how screwed over they have been and all the good money they paid out for the illegal work to be carried out speaks up & amp nbsp <unk> - boss** you are to leave here give us all your information software and any confidential documents you have your services to our company are now terminated and you will be hearing from our lawyers 
 **boss** - shocked look on face about to scream at me for causing a huge loss to him 
 & amp nbsp i 'm there listening to this all unfold packing up my gear & amp nbsp <unk> to me** - now that you do n't work for <unk> boss we still need all this done and all the other issues in our system done to get us legal do you want a job 
 & amp nbsp needless to say i spent the next few months getting the new gear installed all there illegal software removed which ended up in <unk> every pc they had as both windows and office was the same licence on each machine and getting them all running 
 & amp nbsp and that is how i started a true reliable computer support business that i am not ashamed to say i work for 
 i should also mention a fun fact 
 if you are to try activate the same licence key for the same product way too many times microsoft system flags it and you get a site audit done 
 in my time that i rebuilt the whole system from scratch i registered company with the volume licence program microsoft supplies 
 microsoft came and did their audit and explained what the situation was and why they had the flag and who to go see which i know for a fact they did and it ended in a huge lawsuit which my former company lost for obvious reasons 
 sometimes things happen for a reason and that friday was a very good day now i look back on it 
 <unk> you all enjoyed 
 ** & amp nbsp edit = for all those who notice the bad <unk> grammer etc please read the following & amp nbsp i was 25 when i could read without sounding out the words and writing started about the same time without doing one letter at a time 
 i was born with some issues and had speech <unk> and <unk> so learning how to read and write was a mission and i didnt have anyone who was able to teach me 
 i am trying to get better but obviously whats in my head that makes sense <unk> on paper so i will focus better on future posts and do better for you guys previous heads of department meetings are always a drain 
 <unk> the life out of middle management until they ca n't take any more 
 i sat down at my usual chair i started waiting for the entire ordeal to be over 
 the vp 's secretary walked in the meeting room for the <unk> delivery 
 & gt vpsec : anyone for tea 
 the end of this meeting would come sooner with coffee 
 & gt me : please 
 coffee 
 & gt vp : airz 
 i thought you knew we ca n't have coffee here not with the head of security and his <unk> 
 the ending could n't come soon enough 
 i 'd heard all <unk> words the vp had said and already i 'd started to see the executive floor window as a potential exit point 
 & gt me : i er ... the vp’s secretary looked at me pity in her eyes 
 at least i think it was pity 
 & gt vpsec : tea perhaps 
 i do make a very dark tea 
 & gt me : oh no its okay 
 it’s not a tea day 
 & gt vpsec : a very dark tea 
 very dark <unk> <unk> 
 i thought about it but tea wouldn’t make this meeting go faster 
 & gt me : no thanks though 
 the vp’s secretary looked very disappointed but i didn’t <unk> on it 
 the vp stood up to start the meeting 
 & gt vp : welcome again to a heads of department meeting i want to invite our company consultant to take the floor to tell us about our new ideas box for it 
 & gt con : thanks vp so far we’ve very … 
 interesting … 
 ideas coming through the ideas box 
 however i’d like managers to remind everyone that its for it ideas 
 i started to zone out apparently my <unk> coffee was amazing 
 i looked out the office door i saw the vp’s secretary 
 & gt vp : so you’ve got nothing new from the box yet 
 & gt con : actually yes 
 a timer for it so people know how long it is tickets are taking 
 the vp’s secretary had made a coffee she looked over at me and saw me <unk> 
 & gt vp : oh a timer for it excellent 
 hopefully that’ll be up later this afternoon 
 reality snapped back to me as i heard another unrealistic deadline 
 & gt me : whaaaa 
 a timer are you … & gt con : oh airz don’t worry dear we aren’t implementing it today 
 & gt vp : we’re not 
 & gt con : no no we’ve got to chat to the it staff before hand see the concerns first 
 i looked back out the door the vp’s secretary was just drinking coffee outside the door 
 it was very distracting 
 coffee so close 
 & gt vp : so you’re going to interview all the it staff for ideas 
 & gt con : couldn’t hurt right 
 the vp smiled 
 & gt vp : <unk> from it staff 
 couldn’t hurt at all 
 i looked back at the vp’s secretary she gave me a worried face and mouthed <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> me with coffee gave the vp’s secretary a burnt <unk> right 
 next i 'm a <unk> reader of tfts however this is my first time posting 
 i might post more of some of my experiences later 
 this story happened a week ago 
 i work for a <unk> grocery chain which has an all new hip <unk> 
 we have quite a big office in one of the old <unk> imagine it like a hip tech startup office we got a slide <unk> equipment gaming <unk> mostly for smash <unk> bars in the elevator for a future story 
 there are also a couple of big 4k monitors mounted on in the wall in a 2 wide x 3 high setup 
 this displays a map with all the retail locations on it 
 where you can see some basic info like : if the main and backup connections are working if there has been a error with one of the pin terminals or cash registers 
 if the local database is in sync with the main server 
 how many <unk> devices are in the store i have no idea how these <unk> exactly work we just use that info because it looks cool 
 the local setup in the stores is as followed you have the cash registers which communicate with a local server which <unk> all the purchases with the main server 
 this is done because if a location lost connection to the main server all the cash registers couldn’t be used anymore now the local server just keeps track of the <unk> and <unk> it when to location comes back online later 
 the software running on the cash registers is not made by use and all the cash registers are not managed by us this is done by the company who makes the cash register software 
 in this lovely scenario the cash register software needs its own cash register server which all it does is acts as a translator between their own protocol and the database 
 $ cashregistersoftwarecompany informs us that they are going to push a update to us on the 11th of march <unk> this new version has some <unk> on packages on the server that are not available for this version of the distro 
 the best point would be to <unk> all the servers however due to time <unk> it’s decided that we are going to do a distro update 
 sadly when testing the distro update on one of the test machines same image we notice that it hangs on certain parts of the distro update 
 so i was tasked with writing a script which would fix all these issues it hangs on 
 i was making some good progress when i push the latest version of the script to our git system 
 it clearly has in the description of the branch that the script is not finished not working and should not be used yet then i left for holiday 
 after enjoying my holiday for 2 days my phone starts blowing up 
 - warning : location a has closed the vpn connection and has n't reconnected 
 - warning : location a is not responding on the main connection 
 - warning : location a is not responding on the backup connection 
 - warning : location a hasn’t checked in for a sync in 15min 
 i start getting these messages from about <unk> locations my phone is lagging like crazy then i get a panic call telling me that all the local servers are offline and in about 1 hour it’s going to be the busiest moment in all the stores for the week 
 my coworkers are panicking about the potential loss of profit and i’m somewhere on top of a mountain wearing full <unk> gear 
 to make things worse the it department is running on a <unk> crew because most of us are away for the holiday 
 the first thing i ask if that it’s maybe a issue with our status system or the connection in our office 
 they do not know and will call me back 
 in the meantime i’m <unk> down the mountain like a maniac who wants to test if he can break the world record on <unk> 
 i jump in my car and rush to the hotel as fast as possible 
 when i’m almost there i get scared by a bright flash i got flashed by a speed camera speed cameras in my home country don’t flash anymore 
 i’m pretty sure this is going to be a lovely picture 
 when i finally make it to my hotel i grab my macbook and run to the hotel lobby only place to get wifi 
 i log in and try to ssh into any of the local servers but all of them accept the connection but they they ca n't get past the login it’s just hanging on a black screen 
 i try to access the status page of the <unk> where i get a page that returns <unk> 
 in that moment it dawned on me 
 all the servers were stuck somewhere in <unk> someone ran the distro update 
 at this point i get called back by a somewhat less stressed coworker this coworker told me that all the cash registers are still working fine but all the servers are still not working 
 i tell him i suspect that someone ran the distro update 
 my coworker added our contact at $ cashregistersoftwarecompany to our phone call 
 our contact person told us that they had some time left and decided to force push a update to all our devices running software from $ cashregistersoftwarecompany 
 we tell them they broke all the local servers and our contact at $ cashregistersoftwarecompany started to worry so he added a tech from $ cashregistersoftwarecompany that pushed the update to all our machines 
 this tech told us that it could in no way be the fault of $ cashregistersoftwarecompany because they followed all the instructions they even ran the latest version of my script to run the distro update 
 at this point i’m getting really pissed i ask him if he even read what the title of the <unk> said 
 $ cashregistersoftwarecompany tech said that he got the script from his boss 
 so $ cashregistersoftwarecompany techs boss gets added to the conference call 
 all he says it that it’s not his fault and we should have made sure our script worked before they ran the update which was planned for the 11th of march and he hangs up 
 at this point $ cashregistersoftwarecompany is pointing the blame at us and are saying they can’t do anything about it anymore followed by them hanging up the phone 
 we were lucky that the all the stores were still working locally it only major inconvenience for our customers was that the stores could not check the stock on other locations and they could only swap or get a refund at the location they bought it at 
 at this point another coworker noticed that the server are still checking for new promo media this is being displayed in store on the <unk> or discounts that are being <unk> on the audio system 
 this runs twice every day before store opening and closing 
 <unk> the way it’s setup is that all the new promo media that gets downloaded is being placed in a <unk> script that gets run 
 so we start working on trying to finish the update script 
 at this point a lot of other people start getting back at the hotel and the internet connections start randomly losing the connection closing my vpn and vnc sessions 
 so i decide to continue to work using my hotspot on my work phone 
 the way mobile providers work in europe is that as soon as you leave your home country you start roaming and roaming is expensive as hell <unk> / mb so after about an hour my 4g connection drops i receive i reached the <unk> <unk> of 60 euro data roaming bill and in order to continue data roaming i need to login into my $ telcobussnisssite and flip the switch 
 the only people with access to $ telcobussnisssite are on the billing department and all of them are already gone to home 
 the hotel wifi has died and is unusable under all the children watching reaction videos and <unk> on youtube 
 i know that bottom and the top of the mountain there is <unk> good wifi 
 so i drive back there 
 wifi is working good there but in order to keep my car warm i need to keep the engine running and after about an hour a cop shows up at my car asking what the hell i’m doing in my best german i try to explain that i’m using the wifi but my german is probably way too bad for him to understand it i try to explain it in english but he doesn’t understand a word i’m saying 
 fortunately his colleague was speaking good english and he and his colleague were laughing at my when he was explaining his colleague in german 
 so after about another hour the script seems to work on our test setup so i <unk> back for the hotel while my colleague back at the office was replacing the media update script with this hacking barely functioning script 
 the next day i get out of bed early in my <unk> i go to the hotel lobby opened my laptop order some overpriced coffee and waited staring at the web version of our status wall 
 after about 15min after the media <unk> supposedly had been download the first location comes back online followed by all other locations where the last location came back online after about 2 hours 
 there is a big meeting scheduled with $ cashregistersoftwarecompany about <unk> our service with them 
 sorry for some grammer errors english is not my native language so a few years back <unk> my sister decided that she wanted a dvd-rom drive in her computer so she went and bought one and installed it herself 
 then i get the call ... sis : hey i bought a dvd drive for my pc ... i 've got it installed but i ca n't read any discs with it '' 
 me : in my head : you installed it '' 
 um ok tell me what you did 
 she proceeds to tell me how she disconnected the old cd-rom and reconnected the new dvd-rom and was having trouble since 
 then i get this : sis : i see in the instructions it says something about jumper settings do you think that could be it '' 
 me : <unk> ... take the drive out and tell me what the jumper settings are per the instructions '' 
 sis : well it looks like they 're in the right position what the manual says is ma '' 
 me : blown away at this point since she properly connected an ide cable ... move the jumper to <unk> and see if it works 
 couple of minutes later she tells me it works now 
 <unk> me with a <unk> my tech-illiterate sister installed a new optical drive and the only thing she got wrong was not setting the <unk> jumpers correctly 
 she actually read the fucking manual 
 *edit* : some background info ... she took advantage of a program where she works whereby employees can receive training in a subject that can be applied in the office 
 she ended up taking an introduction to computers maintenance and repair 
 she and her husband are very money conscious having raised a large family and thus when they could fix something themselves they would 
 this is the one sister who never calls for tech help 
 the rest of my <unk> are no better than simple jack when it comes to tech 
 now stop asking if she 's single you sad desperate users 
 disclaimer : sadly i 'm unfamiliar with how the company to store process takes place or who are the people my boss talks on the phone with but the most notorious being $ mrred again forgive me if i 'm making mistakes regarding who is my boss contacting amd i love them and this shows how this person was completely in no way someone capable of representing them 
 remember how i mention a while ago that my boss does n't get along with an amd sales representative 
 i only met them once but $ mrred does n't seem like the best kind of person in a couple of occasions the processor shipment has gotten damaged on the way and $ mrred certainly was n't the <unk> person all <unk> but he got the job done until ... we got the parts shipment today in the morning quick before signing my co-worker verified the contents of the shipment they had sent us the wrong shipment not the series we have to get back in stock 
 my boss pick up the phone and head to his desk picking up the phone and calling amd 's office or similar to complain about the error again 
 he put the loudspeaker since the store was empty and as usual my boss set up the call <unk> 
 & gt $ mrred : hello mister elboss how may i attend you today 
 & gt $ elboss : red the shipment you send it 's not correct you send me <unk> the wrong <unk> 
 & gt $ mrred : that 's not possible i place the right <unk> where they are supposed to go 
 & gt $ elboss : red this is the third time this happens since you got in charge of this state what 's going on 
 you know what let me talk to your boss 
 & gt $ mrred : it wo n't be necessary i 'll just send the right one after you bring me back the shipment i sent 
 & gt $ elboss : <unk> 
 no 
 the conversation got heated and a minute later ... & gt $ elboss : just get me <unk> boss 
 & gt $ mrred : you know what 
 you can go -- -- yourself <unk> -- -- i do my job 
 our <unk> dropped including a client that just came in there was an awkward silence then we heard $ mrred hang up the phone 
 30 minutes later we got another call loudspeaker on 
 & gt $ <unk> : good evening mr. <unk> we are from amd we deeply apologize for everything that <unk> caused he is no longer working with us we 're assigning someone new soon to your distribution zone 
 they were taking for a while all relaxed and nice <unk> good 
 tl dr : mrred almost make us go <unk> tfts 
 my tale begins with a small law firm that we found had a dead hdd in their server 
 as we all know hdd 's die sometimes and this is why we use raid 
 we go ahead and purchase a new one for them and go install it 
 it begins rebuilding the raid and seeing that it will take several hours i head back to my office to monitor it remotely 
 after about 40 mins i notice the server go offline 
 i think to myself *that cant be good 
 * and give them a call 
 the receptionist answers and the following occurs 
 me = me r = receptionist & gt me : hi i was just in doing some work on your server but it appears to be offline 
 can you please check that the status lights on the front of it for me 
 & gt r : it is off 
 it was making too much noise so i powered it down 
 <unk> of stunned silence* & gt me : you turned it off ... 
 & gt r : yes we cant have it making too much noise in the office 
 we have clients here 
 & gt me : and you did not think to call me to let me know it was making lots of noise so that i could fix it 
 never mind i am coming over now 
 so i quickly <unk> into the server to see if i can get it back online before i head over and i see that it is not detecting a hdd 
 i grabbed my kit and went on site 
 after a quick <unk> my fears were confirmed 
 the raid was dead 
 they were down for a whole day after that while re rebuilt their raid and recovered from backup 
 the worst part is that the receptionist tried to blame it on us 
 i still do n't know <unk> the server was making more noise and will all the logs gone there is no way for me to find out 
 tldr : receptionist hard shut down the server while the raid was rebuilding because it was making too much noise '' 
 killed the raid 
 addendum : to eliminate any confusion as to why she could get into the server room i will clarify 
 she was the staff member who was selected by the boss there to change the backup tapes 
 because of this she had keys to the server <unk> morning finally arrived 
 i slightly <unk> myself that i managed to get through the entire weekend without wasting a single further thought on angie 
 with no <unk> in the weather the early shift seemed to be of little comfort with the snow beating down as hard as it could 
 i was however brandishing a new set of gloves and a can of ice <unk> fluid 
 surprisingly the day went off without a hitch 
 the snowy weather had landed most of the team off with <unk> '' and notably angie had n't made it in 
 myself and mafg managed to pile through a bunch of tickets when balding head of it came in 
 he asked me if i could attend a meeting later which i obliged 
 fairly sure this was the meeting '' i began to mentally prepare my defense 
 i was again pleasantly surprised that this meeting was not one in which my ass would be summarily served but rather a meeting of several heads brandishing a new project 
 it seemed that there was to be a conference in the not too <unk> future and the marketing sales and product reps had worked hard to secure a vendor for a new medical crm product to replace the aging <unk> <unk> based system 
 they also wanted to work in a complete laptop refresher <unk> replacing any laptop over 2 years old 
 bhit made particular mention of a desktop rollout i performed last year - it was actually my initial 3 months contract but as i 'd proven myself worthy was taken on full time 
 my job was to be responsible for managing the physical delivery of the new hardware/software as appropriate 
 i set to work on the task with <unk> <unk> active directory for a list of machines users and specs 
 one thing i always made sure of was to carry on my predecessor 's good work in maintaining a <unk> active directory : a place for everything and everything in it 's place 
 every audit we had although occasionally revealing some discrepancies everything was up to date and reports were reliable 
 after <unk> my results i determined that <unk> odd laptops would require replacement and approximately 250 builds would need to go on across three different hardware types - two already in use in the field and could continue and one for the new laptop specs 
 as soon as i could get the final signed off software from the vendor i could go about getting images prepared qa 'd and <unk> in some of my <unk> reps to pilot the new builds before the big day 
 my analysis done and sent to bhit i wrapped up for the day 
 all thoughts of that coffee <unk> stick insect were thoroughly out of mind 
 my smile was demolished tuesday morning 
 angie had made it in and was busy setting about the task of <unk> anything that looked like progress 
 the instant i appeared she demanded my attention in the <unk> 
 sure enough this was it 
 she now required a full explanation as to my actions the previous friday 
 i say explanation after my defense of our security access to the it cupboard had been withdrawn was thrown straight back at me for failing to understand proper protocol she just ripped into yet another starbucks <unk> tirade about leaving a <unk> high and dry for an hour while i <unk> about 
 she then also ripped me a new one asking what i was doing taking apart a pc in the middle of the office 
 it seemed that some of the fat finance wenches had <unk> me out as well and claimed i 'd caused such a loud commotion they were prevented from working 
 i wonder if it 's the same finance hag that is in her coffee group 
 this dressing down seemed to last forever and it did ... this was a good 20 <unk> 
 dressing down fully received i decided to <unk> once more 
 i mailed our bhit and cc 'd the rest of support questioning why we were no longer <unk> access to the it cupboard for equipment where we should go if angie is not around to give her approval to retrieve gear from the cupboard and most importantly where are we supposed to work on machines or hardware 
 these were things which worked perfectly fine a few weeks ago were now suddenly were not fine 
 the reply from bhit was as usual fairly impotent and full of <unk> statements 
 his response that he was unaware the it cupboard was being used as a build area for hardware came as a shock to us all particularly as he was the one who got the ghost server off the 3rd line team in the first place 
 he concluded by requesting that we should <unk> clarification of suitable build areas from our manager angie 
 i could see we were going to get nowhere on this path 
 the water <unk> 
 i held my breath cited 15 odd tickets in my queue which would require extensive <unk> and imaging time none of which could occur at my desk and none of which could even happen as the build server with all our images had been thrown in a riser room which of course none of us could now access anymore 
 added to that with the conference project looming exactly where were we meant to image these machines 
 and how would i be able to access our build server for the task at hand - my nightly whatsalive script reporting it as the only machine missing in action 
 as a <unk> of the extent of his ineptitude instead of <unk> a reply he simply replied to all and inserted angie 's email at the top with the words angie can you please direct jon6 appropriately 
 thanks '' 
 you can guess the next conversation 
 what conference is this and what makes you think you have anything to do with it '' 
 angie demanded 
 as bhit had truly dumped me in it i had to relay all about my task for the conference 
 she would find out anyway the train was in motion 
 of course this was now something new she could micromanage to the <unk> degree but not without a <unk> first 
 she first demanded to know why she was never informed 
 i responded bhit had been present in the meeting too 
 given my handling of the xp rollout and desktop replacement project last year this is why bhit and several heads asked for me by name 
 that said as it 's a major project i find it difficult to believe that you were not in the loop with this one already '' 
 whoa ... <unk> of milk meeting room 7 ... could it be score 1 to jon6 
 in reality i already knew that angie was already plotting 
 if i was a <unk> man i 'd have said the plan was already made in her mind she was too sharp to not have planned all the fine details already 
 all she needed was the time to put it into effect 
 what the plan was i have no idea only the future will tell 
 but i did know at that moment that this process wo n't go well 
 it will either be mired in <unk> ... or i just wo n't do it at all 
 so i managed to get my <unk> in that one time but i now have a fight on my hands 
 on the one hand i 've made enough of an impression by some heads to have been asked for by name to drive this forward 
 on the other hand i had the bitch manager from hell bent on thrusting her <unk> of incompetence into the beating heart of anything <unk> efficiency 
 and there was still no response about where <unk> should be taking place 
 one thing i was sure of ... if we 're going to play this game let the games begin 
 **previous** this happened a year ago right after i started my job at big <unk> corporate hospital 
 i am one of the sysadmins but i am basically the <unk> girl for random tasks such as web development 
 no one else in the it department knows how build a website or write code so it defaults to me 
 normally i work to support our users and our clients but in this situation i was the client trying to purchase software from a vendor 
 my boss had given me the task of upgrading the design of our intranet website 
 the website allows all the doctors and nurses to log in and view their departmental policies and other work-related information but it is very basic 
 my boss decided that we would contract externally with a vendor to set up a company wide pto calendar because he did not want me wasting man hours coding a pto calendar when we could just buy one 
 i set up a meeting with the vendor and booked a nice conference room so that we could hook up our laptops 
 i had to fight with one of the nurses over which conference room i was allowed to use but i was victorious 
 the day of the meeting rolled around and i headed to the conference room early to set up 
 i turned on one of our ancient projectors and went to make a pot of coffee in the lobby while the projector warmed up 
 it was <unk> warm so i took some time to appreciate how god awful hot it was outside while i waited for the vendor and my boss to show 
 a knock on the lobby door signaled the early arrival of the vendor 
 i opened the door to greet him and to my surprise he pushed me aside and sat down in the lobby 
 the vendor was an older gentleman grey haired and in his <unk> a typical southern gentleman so i figured that he just did n't notice me and i walked over to introduce myself 
 hello my name is tinyneko and i am the - '' sweetie would you fetch me a cup of coffee '' 
 excuse me '' 
 would you mind grabbing me a cup of coffee 
 i 'm waiting for the web developer to show up for our meeting 
 it 's at <unk> pm '' 
 absolutely but i am - '' <unk> 
 i wo n't be able to hear him arriving if you are n't quiet 
 just be a dear and fetch me the coffee '' 
 i did n't know what to say but i decided to just remain quiet and fetch the coffee 
 there are certain <unk> that we pick in life and i was n't in the mood to fight 
 i had made the coffee for the meeting so why not just give him a cup of coffee 
 i poured him a cup of coffee and handed it to him 
 do you have any sugar 
 who drinks coffee without sugar '' 
 i did n't respond verbally but i nodded and went to fetch the vendor some sugar from the cafeteria 
 when i got back the vendor was missing and the door to the conference room was closed 
 i figured he had gone to the restroom so i sat down and waited for him to return 
 fifteen minutes passed and it was <unk> pm 
 no sign of the vendor or my boss 
 i send my boss an email from my phone asking where he is 
 another fifteen minutes pass and it 's now <unk> pm 
 i 'm pissed off and the vendor is no where to be found 
 my phone beeps and it 's a message from my boss saying that both he and the vendor are <unk> in the conference <unk> 
 i knock on the conference room door and the vendor and my boss are standing around chatting 
 tinyneko where have you been 
 we were waiting for you 
 steve have you met our web developer tinyneko '' 
 well i was setting up for the meeting but then i was informed that the vendor was waiting for the web developer to arrive 
 since i 'm obviously not the web developer i was locked out of the conference room 
 silly me it would n't have happened if i just had the coffee supplies prepared '' 
 my boss was confused for a moment but i watched as he understood 
 his web developer who was stretched so thin on man hours that we have to contract externally was told to get coffee and an hour of her work hours wasted 
 his demeanor turned icy and he told the vendor that we would have to <unk> 
 if you ca n't guess how this ends we never signed the contract and i ended up writing the pto calendar <unk> post in the sub 
 here goes nothing ... i’m a specialized sysadmin at a medical school 
 at the time of this story we’ve recently switched to a new website for online learning 
 the old one is in the last <unk> of its use for the current semester 
 but despite our best efforts professors seem to ignore every <unk> informing them of the move 
 i get this call : & gt ** $ prof : ** i can’t see any of my courses for next semester on the site 
 & gt ** $ me : ** are you looking on the new website at new site 
 & gt ** $ prof : ** yes 
 i’m on there grading students right now 
 i groan <unk> knowing that students aren’t on the new site yet 
 & gt ** $ me : ** that’s the old one 
 please go to new site 
 & gt ** $ prof : ** i just told you i’m already there 
 & gt ** $ me : ** what does your browser show in the address bar 
 & gt ** $ prof : ** old site 
 & gt ** $ me : ** then you’re on the old site 
 you have to go to new site for future <unk> 
 & gt ** $ prof : ** why wasn’t i told 
 & gt ** $ me : ** it’s been <unk> many times through announcements on old site 
 & gt ** $ prof : ** oh i don’t read those 
 & gt ** $ me : ** there have also been emails to all faculty about it from several different departments 
 & gt ** $ prof : ** you can’t just assume that i pay attention to all my emails 
 you should have called 
 she did n't understand why we could n't possibly call every single professor and inform them of the change 
 this happened several times over the next few weeks 
 to <unk> : i work at a <unk> <unk> 
 these are the people training our future doctors 
 do they just ignore their patients charts too 
 edit : <unk> work for a small software developer as a female system support technician 
 i 've worked here for about 3 months but i have many years support experience in various fields 
 the call which i am about to record took place this morning 
 & gt **me : ** $ <unk> this is vedagock speaking 
 how may i help you 
 & gt ** $ manlydude : ** hi vedagock this is $ manlydude from $ <unk> 
 one of our customers is reporting a problem with your software and i would like to speak to $ <unk> 
 & gt **me : ** unfortunately $ <unk> has gone back to school and only works <unk> now 
 i am his replacement though may i help you instead 
 & gt ** $ manlydude : ** hmm no 
 can i talk to a man instead 
 & gt <unk> this guy for real 
 please let this be a misunderstanding 
 * & gt **me : ** excuse me 
 i am unfortunately the only support staff available at the moment please tell me what the issue is and i will take a look at it 
 & gt ** $ manlydude : ** just have one of your male colleagues call me when they 're available ok 
 & gt <unk> the actual shit 
 i ca n't even ... * i proceeded to take his name and number and leave a note for one of my colleagues to call him 
 i wish i could have thought of something smart to say but i am still in shock 
 this is the first time in all my support years that this has ever happened to me and i needed to vent 
 i just really hope that this guy does n't have any female colleagues 
 edit : formatting 
 also the reason is hopefully not porn 
 our software is installed on servers in the healthcare sector $ <unk> being hired for the day to day it operations would have way bigger problems than me being <unk> if porn was the <unk> a decade ago i worked on the <unk> of things in the medical software field 
 one saturday morning my phone started ringing at the ungodly hour of 5am -- it was my boss and he stayed on the line just long enough to say these seven magical words : <unk> corruption outdated backups get here now 
 on-call for disaster recovery was something i frequently helped out with so i <unk> on in to the office only to find that it was no ordinary data <unk> job -- my entire group had been called away from their weekend plans as the hospital in question was one of the largest hospitals we supported $ hospital 
 somehow the <unk> structure for <unk> single active patient <unk> had been completely corrupted over 10,000 accounts and this had a wonderful <unk> down into the <unk> structures as well 
 just to make things simpler for us their most recent backups were almost <unk> hours out of date -- way too old for us to just restore everything from 
 $ hospital was completely unable to load any of the corrupted accounts with doctors & amp nurses having to rely on <unk> paper files for everything 
 cue *many* frantic <unk> and <unk> hours of us restoring patient information from the outdated backups then manually rebuilding as much of the missing information as we can from various other <unk> we could find 
 dozens of new build data x off of indexes y and z '' scripts were created that day some of which are actually still in use to this day 
 closing on a full 13 hours after the corruption initially hit and we finally have $ hospital back up and running with almost all of the patient data rebuilt 
 data integrity routines are now coming up clean but we still have no idea what in the name of dread <unk> caused the corruption in the first place 
 hardware guys are reporting every diagnostic tool they have is showing perfect disk health so it 's probably not their fault 
 all of our attempts to reproduce the corruption in any way possible have come up empty so it 's probably not our fault either 
 we 're completely stumped tired and just want to go home and <unk> what 's left of our weekend at this point - so we leave various <unk> scripts running and tell $ hospital that we 'll carefully monitor them over the rest of the weekend but ca n't do a proper review until regular staff is back in during normal business hours 
 we all head home at this point and i spend a while <unk> with my good friend <unk> <unk> before calling it a night 
 cue the next morning and i 'm suddenly blasted awake by my phone ringing yet again at 5am 
 the seven magic words my boss <unk> this time are <unk> shit it happened again we 're doomed 
 so <unk> a <unk> hangover and muttering threats of death against both bright lights and loud noises i head in yet again 
 thankfully the backups this time were only about an hour old -- and we 'd already written all of the needed <unk> scripts less than a day ago 
 the restore and rebuild goes much quicker this time <unk> only by the fact that $ hospital is quite literally <unk> at us threatening lawsuits re : patient care and safety etc 
 anything involving lawyers was and thankfully still is outside my pay grade so company executives on our end are being summoned away from their sunday golf <unk> or whatever it is they do on weekends and have started arriving in the office purple-faced with rage 
 meanwhile we lowly programmers have been given explicit orders to figure out what in the seven <unk> is going on and this time nobody gets to go home until we have a cause found and solution in place 
 there 's just one catch -- none of our <unk> code is showing data writes from our end 
 hardware is still reporting <unk> so we 're just as stumped as before except now we have angry executives breathing down our necks 
 at this point six hours into day two of corruption hell i noticed a pair of tickets from $ hospital sitting out there with several requests for updates of course -- one for saturday and one for sunday both saying hey we have n't had the daily charges files post for our accounts today '' 
 we 'd just been ignoring them as there *was* a minor apocalypse taking our attention but suddenly the <unk> light bulb over my head finally clicked on 
 $ hospital did n't just use my company 's software -- they also used $ othervendor to compile a daily file of recurring charges for active accounts which would then be posted to our system via an interface my company provides 
 an interface that $ othervendor 's programmers were notorious for complaining about saying it was too slow '' 
 i run a quick check and sure enough the $ <unk> & gt us daily active account charges '' files exist all the way up until friday morning -- there are no files for saturday and sunday 
 daily charge files from $ othervendor would be filed to every active account 
 check 
 time the files are scheduled to post to our system 
 <unk> 
 this was more than enough evidence for us to completely turn off the interface plus blacklist $ othervendor 's machines from connecting to our data servers at all 
 monday morning rolls around and all is quiet 
 no 5am emergency call 
 <unk> 
 i hear my boss give our $ othervendor counterparts a call later that morning and this was the point at which the <unk> shit <unk> hit the <unk> fan 
 he speaks to them calmly for a few minutes then puts them on hold makes a second call and sits there 
 barely more than a minute later <unk> of our execs arrive at a dead sprint close his office door take $ othervendor off hold and the volume of the call rapidly increases until they could 've woken the dead 
 it took a few days for everything to completely shake out most of which i was n't directly involved in because company lawyers were 
 it turned out that a programmer at $ <unk> with <unk> <unk> of <unk> decided our interface was just too slow '' and came up with their own code to try and write their data directly to our data structures 
 our encrypted data structures 
 the structures they <unk> can only interact with via our interface 
 and if all of this were n't already bad enough he actually sent his code directly from $ othervendor 's <unk> system to the hospital 's production environment because it worked fine '' on his system -- when he was using a completely different data model 
 <unk> enough $ othervendor programmer was immediately terminated possibly literally as nobody i know heard of him again there was a quite successful lawsuit by $ hospital against $ othervendor and i took myself off the disaster recovery on-call list as quickly as i <unk> working in it in iraq in 2007 i was taken hostage 
 see <unk> : while i was a hostage one of the militia came in and asked if i could sort out his <unk> laptop as it was running slow and he could not install the cracked game he had just purchased from the market 
 not feeling in a particularly helpful frame of mind what with being chained up and fearing death and all that i spent a few minutes looking over it and concluded that i could not help 
 about 15 minutes later the guy returned and asked if i could try again as his commander was giving him some verbal over it 
 i spent the next hour <unk> adware and stopping programs from running when windows booted and did a general cleanup 
 also managed to get his cracked copy of <unk> of honour working which seemed to make everyone happier 
 feeling somewhat pleased with my <unk> in what only can be described as extreme circumstances i returned the laptop 
 the commander left and his subordinate came in to see me 
 he smacked me over the head with a pistol causing my head to bleed explaining that next time he asked me to do something i was to do it the first time around 
 2 years 7 months and 1 day later or <unk> days i got released 
 never had a bad day at the office since 
 i sit in my office surrounded by new equipment 
 the budget in my hand looking amazing 
 everything was finally going well 
 if only i could get rid of security everything would be perfect 
 i glanced down at my computer 
 & gt new urgent message & gt **** come up to my office to handover the reigns of security to the new hire 
 **** & gt the vp i took a sip of my coffee before getting up 
 who knew today all my wishes would come true 
 as i walked up to the vp 's office i wondered if life got any better 
 probably not 
 arriving at the vp 's office the vp 's new secretary asked which <unk> i would prefer for the meeting 
 & gt me : coffee thanks 
 & gt sec : no problems airz coming right up 
 i smiled 
 coffee was on its way security was leaving 
 perfect day 
 the vp arrives at his office and smiles at me 
 behind him walks a gentleman in a suit 
 & gt vp : quite a day finally passing on the managerial responsibility of security 
 & gt me : i 'm sure i 'll be sad to see it go 
 i look up at the suited man <unk> 
 & gt vp : oh yes airz 
 this is security head he 'll be replacing you 
 & gt me : security head nice to meet you 
 & gt sechead : i 've taken a quick tour of the security arrangements this morning 
 it seems you 're the man who 's responsible for the waste of <unk> 
 the vp looked taken aback 
 & gt vp : settle down settle down 
 airz was covering two busy positions 
 you 'll be able to implement all the security changes you see fit 
 security head smiled but i was barely listening 
 coffee had arrived it was officially the best day 
 i took a sip 
 tasted like heaven 
 & gt vp : we 're getting sued 
 i looked down at my coffee 
 heaven 
 or hell 
 i could n't tell 
 & gt vp : the reason you two are meeting today is because the guy who destroyed the air conditioner is now suing the company for wrongful termination 
 so we need to get our new security expert up to speed on the situation so he can testify 
 & gt me : why 
 he ca n't testify if he was n't employed at the time of the incident 
 & gt vp : he cant 
 & gt me : what would he have to say 
 & gt vp : oh ... well i 'm going to need you to get me a list of all the equipment that was destroyed because of the vandals actions 
 i took a sip of coffee and thought about all the equipment that was replaced because it was badly damaged '' 
 this list became much shorter if you took out all the working but needed a convenient excuse to upgrade items 
 & gt me : sure ... & gt vp : and your first job as security manager is to find the tapes of the incident 
 & gt sechead : tapes of the incident 
 & gt vp : from the cameras outside 
 & gt sechead : the cameras outside 
 the new security head looked confused 
 & gt sechead : i 've done a full inspection of the property this morning and i can tell you there are no cameras outside 
 & gt vp : what 's the black camera thing pointing directly at the air conditioner 
 & gt sechead : oh that 's a spotlight with no bulb in it 
 which we do need to fix as a security priority 
 & gt vp : so there 's no footage of the incident 
 & gt sechead : none 
 & gt vp : no footage of the <unk> 
 the err ... damage 
 & gt sechead : sorry but no 
 & gt vp : mmmm that 's terrible news i thought that was a camera 
 the vp has said terrible but he was smiling 
 the smile was wide 
 i took a sip of my coffee 
 heaven had gone 
 next all the older posts are coming in <unk> form fingers crossed for soon 
 so many spelling errors 
 several years ago i was helping a client set up and install new workstations as the old ones were obsolete and in dire need of an upgrade 
 it was my very first job and i was expected to answer basic support questions when i met with the user and swapped out their old pc for a brand spanking new one 
 i was in the middle of <unk> up the monitor when another user approached me regarding an odd e-mail he and his coworkers had received only minutes ago 
 this is pretty much what it looked like : & gt important 
 & gt please do not shut down your computer today as it will not boot back up again if you do 
 & gt / it it so happened to be april 1 and neither i or my coworkers had heard anything about this 
 since there was very little information in the email everyone naturally thought it was a joke but then people around us started to yell how their computers actually would not boot 
 oops 
 turns out the antivirus software had received an update over the night which caused it to flag some system files as malicious and then removed them 
 it was fixed later the same day but i ca n't help but feel that more workstations could have been saved if they had only been more <unk> or bothered to write this is not a joke '' somewhere in the initial <unk> was a fun one 
 an <unk> of ours we ended up firing them as a client is a health center that was very difficult to deal with for several reasons most of which had to deal with failure to comply to our requests and challenging most every decision we made for their company 's it needs 
 constant fighting over money did not help either 
 one of the requests that was made by our customer was to provide them with a free printer for signing a contract with my company 
 we felt that the business that we would gain from a contract would be worth the expense of a new printer for their office so we complied 
 we were told that it would need to be color and have the ability to fax and copy 
 we ended up purchasing a <unk> ~ $ <unk> hp laserjet all-in-one printer for their office and i was tasked with going on-site to set it up 
 upon arrival and showing our customer the printer i was scolded and informed that was “not what they asked <unk> 
 wait what 
 they specifically asked for a color printer that could make copies and send faxes '' 
 this was exactly that 
 how could it be so wrong 
 what our customer was expecting was a professional corporate copier such as a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 this would be the first of many <unk> with this customer but i learned from an early stage that sometimes it is absolutely necessary to say no to customers and to explain why a free ~ $ 6,000 copier was not going to happen 
 edit : a <unk> another story from my recently last workplace 
 this was when i was on leave for studies and i had agreed to come in and help during weekends for some extra cash 
 customer <unk> had a planned power outtage for rebuilding their power mains during a weekend 
 being a data and comms center they of course had two separate power sources with ups so work was being done one side at a time 
 i told my supervisor that i 'd be glad to help but that i 'd need some prep work with <unk> that all servers we were entrusted with were connected to power outlets on the b side 
 got a mail from my coworker saying that everything was prepped and fine 
 come work night 
 i arrive head up to the office take a quick look around and see that all our servers are indeed connected up to b side 
 i grab a coffee and wait for the other departments and the electricians 
 when they arrive we make a check list for the activities and the electricians are let into the mains room while i stay up in the noc with the other two department techs 
 about 15 minutes after work start we hear an <unk> <unk> ... '' turning into silence from inside the server room 
 we rush to the door only to find that the card reader is dead 
 it apparently ran on a side power 
 luckily someone had physical keys to the door so we could get in anyway 
 inside i find to my relief that only one half rack of my servers are down due to a <unk> outlet 
 however the other techs seem to have failed prep work so pretty much all the core switches and routers are down 
 a sudden gut feeling tells me to look on twitter 
 yup 
 soccer night 
 customers cable boxes are down 
 rage ensuing 
 we try to get a hold of the electricians but there is no answer 
 about two or three attempted calls later the door to the noc room opens and two rather heavy set police officers enter and start asking us for id 's and what the hell we think we 're doing 
 turns out since the isp offers phone <unk> through their cable boxes this was <unk> as <unk> of vital <unk> services given that nobody could now dial emergency lines 
 we explain what 's going on and the officers demand to take us down to the electricians 
 when we arrive we find that : a. the door to the mains room is locked with a card reader 
 that runs on a side power 
 and they did n't have keys 
 b. there 's no phone reception in the basement 
 c. the electricians had forgotten some tools needed for the work in their truck and once they had cut power and started splicing the cables they had no way to connect it back 
 letting them out to get their tools power was back up within ten minutes 
 since my servers had survived the ordeal i could go home but i found out some days later that the other techs had spent four hours getting all the customers cable boxes to sync up 
 i guess what i learned and hopefully them too is that prep work is vital 
 tl dr : customer does power outtage brings down vital community services police arrives 
 edit : wow top of the page 
 thanks guys 
 : last week i went to my boss whose last name is dotson to ask for a small raise 
 basically what i was asking was for my yearly 4 % raise just early about 6 months before annual reviews 
 my company never gives raises but my wife and i needed to make a little extra to make ends meet so i thought it would n't hurt to ask 
 in the meeting my boss was very <unk> but basically said i 'm sorry but we might not be even be able to give raises at all this year '' 
 to which i basically said thanks anyway '' 
 on the way out in a stroke of sheer brilliance i stuck my head back in his office and said just do n't get cheap on me dotson 
 that was <unk> 's mistake '' 
 i have never seen him laugh that hard 
 he then told me he 'd see what he could do about a raise 
 apparently the cfo who my boss reports to is a huge <unk> park fan 
 like he has signed scripts <unk> posters etc 
 i had no idea 
 but he thought that was great and was slightly upset he had n't made some sort of <unk> reference earlier 
 in the past week i 've overheard him say dotson 
 we have dotson over here '' 
 3 times anyways i was given a 6 % raise and i have lunch with the cfo next week 
 i work in it but i understand this is a fairly generic story 
 hopefully this fits in the <unk> problems cracked by sheer genius '' <unk> this story happened a few years back 
 i 'm a sysadmin for a big german company 
 my wife who is a tech illiterate is working for a tour operator and has to do product presentations in her customers offices quite often 
 one day after one of these presentations she tells me that she thinks something is wrong with her laptop 
 frequent <unk> slower than usual etc 
 & gt **wife** : do you think this could be a virus 
 & gt **me** : hm 
 hard to say 
 could be possible 
 but since i do n't have any administrative rights on your laptop there 's not much i can do 
 go to your admin next thing tomorrow and let him take care of it 
 next day in the office i receive a call : & gt **wife** : honey i went to & lt admin & gt just like you said and he said that it is most probably a virus 
 but i 'm not sure about one detail he mentioned 
 & gt **me** : ok. what is it 
 & gt **wife** : he said since i never was online in the customers network and out network is 100 % secured i might have caught the infection over the vga connection to the projector 
 is that even possible 
 & gt **me** : sweetie i 'll put you on speaker could you please repeat what he was saying 
 my colleagues have to hear this ... since that time i 'm sure as long as guys like & lt admin & gt exist i will be able to find a <unk> the time i was a project manager in the it department for one of the most <unk> medical school and hospital in the world 
 we were in the middle of an 18 month project commonly known as the project from hell by everyone in the department 
 if you are familiar with the health care world you are aware of seriously they take privacy and encryption 
 the scope of the project was encrypt and install central management on 10,000 cell phones tablets laptops and desktops that belonged to students doctors <unk> etc 
 and they were also scattered across several locations around the city 
 i was given 4 temporary techs to complete this <unk> tasks 
 3 of the 4 were constantly unmotivated calling out sick and at times <unk> on the project on purpose because they knew once the project was over they would be out of work 
 however one tech lets call him paul had an amazing work <unk> and was a natural leader of the group 
 he would double even triple the daily quota on a regular basis 
 so when he did not show up to work one day <unk> i knew something was wrong 
 we later found out he had a medical emergency but would be back in the office in a week or two 
 i welcomed paul back and asked if he was okay 
 he talked about his emergency with little detail and made it seem like it was nothing more severe than a common cold 
 it was only a few weeks later that i found out from his direct supervisor that he was placed in the hospital after a heart <unk> due to him not taking his medication 
 i decided to take him out to lunch so i could speak to him on a more personal level 
 and during that lunch he saw me as a friend which i already considered him to be and opened up about how he ca n't afford his medication or to go to the doctor while dealing with several health issues all relating to his heart because not only does he not have health care but is also supporting his <unk> 2 kids 
 the kids father was no where to be found and his sister was in and out of <unk> so the kids were left to him 
 wow i can never complain about my struggles '' ever again 
 fast forward a month later 
 it is time to encrypt a high profile doctor 's iphone 
 so of course i send paul our best technician 
 from what i heard from paul later this doctor was a usual '' 
 he did not understand why we needed to encrypt the phone why we need to install central management and why we needed to spy '' on him 
 although i was not there we did not get any complaints so i am sure paul handled the situation with great customer service as he usually does 
 fast forward 2 weeks 
 that very same doctor loses his phone in the back of a taxi calls it we were able to wipe the phone within minutes 
 by the way when patient data is compromised the organization can be <unk> $ 1 million dollars per patient and the doctor can lose all their license to practice medicine 
 fast forward 1 month 
 paul misses his end of day check in 
 i just assume he 's working late and i will just speak to him in the morning 
 get to work the next morning he is no where to be found 
 when i spoke to his direct supervisor i find out he had a stroke while he was at work and his in a recovering in a room in that very building 
 i instantly think about how he has no healthcare and also since he was a temp he will not be getting paid while in the hospital 
 how was he going to take care of him self and those kids 
 a couple days go by paul 's supervisor come running to my desk with a huge smile on his face 
 turns out the doctor who paul helped a few months ago was one of the best heart <unk> in the world 
 and as soon as he saw paul 's name he insisted on performing the surgery and <unk> his recovery personally 
 when he found out about his lack of health insurance the doctor covered all the costs made a few calls and had paul hired as a full time employee 
 this instantly gave him the health insurance he needed and <unk> pay to help support his <unk> and nephew 
 it 's been over a year and i am at a new job now but i still think about paul everyday 
 whenever i have to deal with a less than ideal client or coworker i think what would paul do 
 or you never know i might need this person to help me out one day 
 edit : all this took place a little over a year ago 
 paul is alive and well today 
 he still works there and has even been recently promoted long time reader first time poster 
 excuse my english i 'm not a native speaker 
 so did n't <unk> to me but to a co-worker of a good friend 
 & gt ** l user : ** my my pc does n't eject the cd probably the drive was stuck or something like that 
 he decides to take a look at the problem 
 as he enters the office the l user is already waiting for him 
 with one look at the pc the problem is clear : & gt <unk> : ** your pc has no <unk> 
 where did you put the cd 's in 
 the l user looks <unk> and points at a gap on the monitor 
 he <unk> the screen and <unk> ten cds fell out of it 
 the problems of <unk> caused by all-in-one pcs ... **edit : ** wow what a feedback thanks guys 
 this is my first post on reddit everything before were just comments 
 probably the most <unk> post i 'll ever <unk> calls says her second monitor is flickering 
 i have the onsite office manager check the cables to make sure they are plugged in and tight 
 response : yes 
 so i say replace the vga cable 
 she does 
 everything is fine 
 next day same monitor is reported dead '' 
 client calls ceo and vp 
 at 10pm on saturday night there 's a big blow up resulting in them demanding <unk> comes out next day to fix 
 so sunday as mad as a bat out of hell i roll out there 
 i find the monitor 's plug to the power cable sitting mostly out of the socket 
 it looked like someone went to plug it in and then changed their mind at the last second the <unk> were was lined up right but not pushed in 
 so i push the plug into the outlet 
 turn on the <unk> monitor and leave 
 bill client $ 120 for time and travel 
 edit : vga cable not <unk> month i told a customer she needs to pay for $ accountingsoftware tech support before we can transfer her $ accountingsoftware onto a different pc the backup was n't restoring correctly and google-fu is pretty <unk> for this program 
 she complained that the boss thought it was n't worth paying to extend support for another year and let it expire then said she would speak to their accountant who also uses $ accountingsoftware to ask if they could <unk> support through them 
 called them today about another issue 
 she asked when she could move onto the other pc 
 i explained we 're still waiting for them to get $ accountingsoftware support 
 & gt nobody told me we needed that '' 
 haha yes we did 
 twice 
 in person and by email 
 playing ignorant might work against a big company but not when there 's only two of us and we 've both told you the same thing when working as a <unk> small managed service provider there are a few key rules that you need to follow in order to keep the business running 
 1. the large companies are the <unk> of your business do anything you can not to lose them 
 2. try to take only business related jobs 
 personal jobs normally involve endless hours of virus <unk> with little customer satisfaction when they receive the bill 
 \**ring <unk> i look at the caller id it 's larry the boss of a major client 
 he 's <unk> aggressive when he needs something done but generally he 's pretty laid back a bit of a <unk> and <unk> 
 & gt me : hello this is <unk> 
 & gt larry : hey man i 'm giving my old iphone to my daughter 
 *alarm bells ring in my <unk> i want her to be on a separate account to the business and i want her to be able to manage it herself also i want her to have her own email address and apple <unk> instead of using mine 
 i think to myself you have a daughter '' 
 i 've probably had 100 phone calls with him and not once has he mentioned his family which is where my surprise came from 
 it 's a good thing for a 13 year old to learn independence and <unk> management 
 & gt me : sure i can do that i 'll need you to go to the shop and get a sim 
 & gt <unk> goes shopping and calls back a few hours later* & gt me : ok so we will need to <unk> ... & gt larry : i 'll put her on 
 & gt me : no that wo n't be <unk> ... too late larry has no time for the struggles of sim activation 
 i hear him talking to his daughter ld to follow the <unk> it guy 's '' instructions 
 & gt *phone <unk> followed by silence* & gt me : hello this is <unk> how are you 
 & gt ld : good 
 as soon as she speaks i realize that i 'm talking to someone who is n't a teenager or maybe she is and she just sounds really young i give her the benefit of the doubt 
 & gt me : can i get you to go to a computer and open up an internet browser 
 & gt ld : can i use my ipad 
 & gt me : sure tap on <unk> 
 then enter url to sim activation '' in the big white bar at the top of the screen 
 & gt ld : *2 minutes of slow <unk> it dawns on me that i 'm going to have to talk a <unk> through activating a sim reading out a mac address joining it to the wifi creating an email account creating an apple id adding an email account and setting up icloud 
 the alarm bells in my head have changed to <unk> <unk> 
 & gt me : umm could i speak to your dad 
 & gt ld : ok *background <unk> daddy said he is very busy 
 & gt me : alright can i speak to your mum then 
 & gt ld : she is not home yet 
 & gt me : are they are any adults at home that i can speak to 
 & gt ld : just daddy 
 & gt me : can you please ask him to call me back when he is n't busy 
 *click* i hang up and thank my lucky stars that i managed to dodge that situation 
 not even 1 minute later ... \**ring <unk> larry on the caller id again 
 & gt me : hello <unk> & gt larry : i need this sim activated 
 & gt me : ok well i need to go through the activation with an adult 
 & gt larry : why 
 she is perfectly capable of following instructions 
 & gt me : she will need <unk> consent for a lot of the registration forms that we 'll need to fill out 
 & gt larry : you have my consent 
 i try and reason with larry in a language he understands 
 & gt me : well at this rate it 's going to take about 3 hours with an adult i could do it in about <unk> minutes 
 & gt larry : i do n't care just get it done 
 *phone <unk> as he passes it to his <unk> great my job description is now managed daycare service provider 
 this is where the real journey begins spending two hours on the phone giving instructions and asking details from a child is a real reminder for why we have rule # 2. i got her to read the information to me as i thought me filling out the form was easier than getting a child to scroll around an ipad screen 
 15 <unk> minutes into activating the sim when i said & gt me : on this next box i will need to enter your date of birth 
 & gt ld : 1 9 1 2 2 0 0 5 
 & gt me : so you are 9 years old 
 & gt ld : <unk> no i am 13 *background <unk> 1 9 1 2 <unk> and one 
 obviously larry had told her that she needed to pretend to be <unk> rather than point the finger and go aha 
 you 're not 13 
 and at the risk of being held <unk> for some <unk> age thing backfiring on me i decided to just <unk> and walk her through logging in to finish the rest of the form on larry 's laptop 
 & gt me : where it says terms & amp conditions you will need to click the small white circle next to yes then click next 
 & gt ld : i 'm clicking it but it 's not doing anything 
 & gt me : try clicking in the middle of the circle 
 & gt ld : <unk> <unk> it 's not working 
 & gt me : put the sharp tip of the mouse <unk> in the middle of the circle and click 
 & gt ld : oh that worked 
 i started to <unk> on the days when i was a computer <unk> navigating the world wide web for the first time sadly all i could recall was static html pages with dark <unk> background colour and black text 
 i 've lost the memory of filling out html forms the first time but i knew that i too needed my hand held when filling out html registration forms 
 i 'd like to think that i would have <unk> known to click the <unk> button once the form was complete or to click the circle next to 'yes instead of clicking the text 
 but realistically it 's something that you learn then forget that you had to learn how to do it 
 i realized something since i 'm a trained it professional i am the most suited person to teach this kid about using the internet properly 
 i 'm not running a damn daycare i am going to run a school 
 i start dropping some computer knowledge over the next 10 minutes i teach her about what <unk> 's are what a <unk> are and how to tell if a website it safe 
 & gt me : can you please hover over <unk> 
 & gt ld : ok. & gt me : now do you see the text starting with in the big white bar at the top 
 & gt ld : yes 
 & gt me : what is that text called 
 & gt ld : umm a url 
 & gt me : that 's right 
 now what is the text that you 're hovering over called 
 & gt ld : a hyperlink 
 & gt me : great 
 now is this hyperlink safe to click on 
 & gt ld : yes because the stuff before the .com matches 
 & gt me : excellent 
 what will it do when you click on it 
 & gt ld : takes me to another web page 
 & gt me : perfect 
 go ahead and click 
 i kept doing spot tests with her every 15 minutes while we were filling out these forms 
 when we get to google i teach her about the green <unk> that the anti-virus software puts next to some of the url 's 
 90 minutes and a few snack breaks go by and we are up to creating the apple id and thankfully larry 's wife gets home and helps out with the account creation 
 trying to remember all the little things you need to do when you create it from a parent 's account is a real struggle especially when you are doing the steps super slowly 
 finally we are done and the phone is set up i say goodbye to the young lady 
 & gt ld : thanks for helping me set up my phone 
 & gt me : no problem remember to browse safely 
 & gt ld : yep 
 *click* i swivel around on my chair and grin at my boss who is busy juggling calls with multiple isps man i am having the best day 
 <unk> : tried to avoid 3 hours of account creation and configuration ended up giving a 9 year old a lesson on using the internet 
 ***** edit : to those first few who read this sorry for the 20 typos extra thankyou for the reddit gold <unk> was working a help desk and these poor <unk> guys were always having issues 
 one day this guy called in and i got him three times 
 found out he 's on the roof of a building trying to troubleshoot 
 after looking into his ticket history the laptop was toast and needed to be replaced but the company did n't want to spring for it 
 so this was near the end of our 45 min conversation : & gt me : ok we are going to try one last thing sir are you near the edge of the building 
 & gt him : <unk> pretty close ... & gt me : oops & gt him : wow the laptop just slipped off the building 
 damned wind must 've taken it out of my hands 
 & gt me : i 'll put in the order to desk side sir you have a better day 
 thankfully the call was n't on the review list or i 'm sure we would 've been in deep doo doo 
 but we both felt better 
 edit : thanks for all the upvotes and for the kind stranger who gilded it 
 did n't even realize it was this popular : - ok short <unk> but <unk> tonight 
 our lone it guy in the late shift <unk> a call from the 3rd <unk> to be warehouse manager he 's supposedly having problems connecting his usb mouse ... ... <unk> quick one i think i redirect incoming calls to my cell and off i go 
 when i get to his office he 's <unk> pounding away on his keyboard and yelling at someone on the phone in <unk> he looks at me and right away screams out that this ca n't be and the machine we gave him hp <unk> pushed to the max is just a giant load of crap ... ... i tell him it 's all good and i 'm here to take a look at it so why not just let me 
 well he does and i check the connectors mouse and keyboard cables sit <unk> in the back connectors so i check the keyboard <unk> work mouse does n't even light up ... ... hmmm i plug my own admin <unk> into the front of the machine works so the controller seems to be fine i run a hardware diagnostic on the controller and while i do that i ask him if there was anything he could think of ... ... <unk> then tells me it was <unk> tough to get in '' and it dawns on me but its not possible is it 
 well i check the back of the machine again unplug the usb keyboard and then try to unplug the mouse ... ... ... its stuck 
 i quit everything shut down the computer and unplug everything but the mouse turn it around and gently <unk> the plug out of the connector and then i see it : he managed to plug the usb in upside down all the way 
 this is a tale of back when i worked it back in college 
 my title was <unk> it <unk> 
 there was ~20 of us that worked on <unk> computers 
 problems from viruses deployments imaging upgrades new equipment mac address management etc 
 i was assigned a ticket that the main computer that handled all of the printing for the writing <unk> and english departments was not turning on 
 this machine was the sole computer connected to one of those <unk> all-in-one <unk> trays of loading <unk> 
 so it was a high priority ticket as the image on it was custom 
 if you were wondering no there was not a backup image to easily replace it go figure 
 i walked up to the building and did a quick diagnostic of the machine 
 no power no lights no nothing 
 i remembering thinking it might be a bad psu or the mobo was shot it was an older machine and this was becoming a more common problem 
 <unk> the machine and brought it back to the office where we fixed all the machines that might take some time 
 i worked on it for maybe an hour updated the ticket with all the information i could 
 i had to go to class so i wouldn’t get back to it for a few hours 
 after class i went over to the same building as i had to pickup another machine for service 
 i wasn’t wearing my <unk> <unk> which was basically a <unk> with a name badge but luckily for me another tech was in the building so i just walked next to him the entire time 
 i should note that wearing these <unk> was a huge deal to the upper it managers 
 most of the regular <unk> didn’t care who you were as long as you could fix the problem 
 so i grab the computer i need write a quick note to the user <unk> my contact info letting them know i had taken it 
 my colleague and i are walking back to the office when a woman yells out to us both 
 i used mary in one of my previous posts so lets call her that & gt mary : <unk> me 
 are you with it ” & gt me : “yes we both <unk> & gt mary : “whats your names ” she grabs a pen and paper and starts <unk> walking towards us & gt me : “i’m <unk> & gt colleague : “i’m <unk> mary looks up very annoyed & gt mary : <unk> names ” & gt me : <unk> ” & gt mary : “are you both students here 
 ” & gt us : <unk> note : you have to be a student to work as a <unk> it <unk> mary yells out to another staff member next door to come over to her 
 & gt mary : <unk> this look like the guy ” mary points right at me as her friend stares through my soul & gt <unk> friend : “yeah that’s him from the video 
 ” so i’m just standing there holding a computer with the dumbest look on my face wondering what is going on & gt <unk> friend : <unk> on i’ll call the <unk> & gt me : <unk> what 
 what is going on 
 ” mary friend rushes back to her office to call them & gt mary : <unk> stole our printer computer and my friend says you look like the guy who stole it 
 campus police is coming here and they have you on video doing it ” imagine a lot of finger pointing while mary is saying this initiate deep breath & gt me : “yes ... i did take the computer earlier because it is broken 
 there is an open ticket for it 
 it’s sitting in the it office being <unk> & gt mary : “no 
 you are lying 
 campus police checked with your supervisor in the it department and there is no ticket open for that computer 
 ” at this point i’m getting very irritated 
 mostly because this <unk> is riding on her high horse thinking she just solved the universities biggest crime story of the year & gt me : “look i can confirm this ticket does exist let me call my <unk> i get him on the phone & gt me : <unk> did campus security call you about a computer that was stolen earlier today ” & gt boss : “yeah there was one stolen that serviced the main <unk> & gt me : “no there is an open ticket for that look at my assigned tickets the last <unk> & gt boss : “oh 
 yeah i guess there is one 
 well i better call campus police about <unk> & gt me : <unk> thanks <unk> i look back over to her with the best shit-eating grin i can muster 
 without missing a step she starts to lecture me on wearing my work uniform 
 now imagine of the most irritated old lady / <unk> / <unk> sounding voice you can and that is what she sounded like & gt mary : “if you had worn your work <unk> while you grabbed the machine earlier this could have been avoided ” & gt me : “well i’m not sure how you missed it but the video in the most sarcastic voice imaginable <unk> '' shows me in my <unk> '' with my <unk> '' on it 
 maybe if you had watched the video more closely you would have noticed it and not wasted my time my bosses time and the police departments time 
 i 'd like to blame this on oversight but in the end no matter which way i cut it i still feel like a moron 
 i bet the tech support gentleman is having a good laugh at my expense 
 so i come home after a <unk> overnight shift at work and <unk> my tired ass onto the computer chair 
 weird skype 's not online 
 in fact nothing was 
 it only felt right to do the usual <unk> <unk> plug <unk> <unk> 
 still nothing 
 shit probably because i 'm a month behind on paying the bill '' 
 so naturally i call up the company pay the bill and have a chat with tech support 
 apparently not having an online light on your router at all does n't exactly mean a disconnect - and i fancy myself knowing a little about computers pft please - apparently i needed to do a little troubleshooting 
 this confused me as i already was pretty sure i did just that 
 the man over the phone asks if i have a router as what i described sounded like an ethernet issue 
 then it hit me 
 it 's been getting cold as shit lately and i was looking for a socket for a personal heater earlier today before work 
 i unplugged what <unk> a phone charger that was plugged in behind my desk - next to all my computer shit 
 i have n't a clue why it did n't click in my head at first 
 sir i 'm incredibly sorry for wasting your time 
 i just realized i did n't even have it plugged in 
 so my friend is a manager at a hosting company which offers basic web hosting vps and dedicated servers 
 this one woman bought a 1200 dollar a month server with <unk> ram and so on and paid for a whole year in advance 
 as you may or may not know dedicated servers offer only the hardware nothing is done to the host itself 
 when clients spend so much money when they call in they go straight through to a manager 
 so one day the client let 's call her <unk> of the <unk> potu called in reaches my friend and was frantic 
 friend : hello this is generic hosting company how can i assist you today 
 potu : hello 
 i bought a server from you guys a few days ago and on your website you claimed 2 hour set up but it is n't online yet 
 friend : no problem let me check it out for you 
 so friend checks their crm and find the server is in fact up and running 
 so he goes back on the line 
 potu : that ca n't be 
 i 'm going to & lt insert pottery company name website here & gt .com and it is n't working 
 friend : i 'm sorry m'am but you do realise that buying a dedicated server means you get only the host and nothing on it right 
 so no website will be created for you 
 potu : but i filled in the box for what you want the server for mind you this is just a questionnaire box for customers to fill in <unk> and said it was for my pottery company 
 friend : that box is only to get feedback from our clients 
 i 'm sorry m'am you 'll have to hire a web developer for that 
 potu : you do n't know what you 're doing i 'm going to the bank to cancel the transaction 
 fuck you sir fuck you 
 friend : m'am wait ... *click* she did in fact get the transaction reversed under the claim that the company is fraud and got my friend into a lengthy expensive investigation 
 tldr : woman buys metal expects human baby to be created 
 not sure if this is the right place for this so feel free to remove if so mods 
 as some background i 'm essentially the it guy for my department 
 i was filled in on a phone call just now 
 guy who frequently comes into the office but i have no interaction with let 's call him mr analogue was trying to explain to someone that he 'd left something by my desk 
 & gt <unk> analogue** : i left that box <unk> guy 's desk & gt <unk> : which guy 
 & gt <unk> analogue** : you know that <unk> man who sits in the corner 
 from now on i 'm going to insist everyone calls me digital-man™ i actually get the feeling that he does n't like me considering that my job is slowly making him obsolete 
 so maybe he sees me as his <unk> 
 hang on.. am i the <unk> 
 feel free to send fan-fics and <unk> 
 **edit** : guys it 's actually happening 
 someone in the office just called me digital-man™ 
 **edit 2** : digital-man™ is <unk> the fan-fics and <unk> 
 may the great <unk> <unk> great knowledge upon you 
 previous <unk> = cleaning product ________ why do tickets always come

 i stared down at my computer 
 new ticket & gt hey i need to borrow a mac tomorrow 
 preferably a laptop 
 thanks 
 <unk> lady i took a sip of my coffee 
 doesn’t sound to hard 
 as i dreamt about who’d think we’d <unk> out desktops to users i was interrupted by color-blind 
 & gt color-blind : hey marketing lady is here 
 i think you just got a ticket from her 
 & gt me : i’m on it 
 i got up from my desk picked up coffee and walked out to the it area 
 & gt me : err… hey marketing lady 
 & gt marl : so i need that laptop now

 white <unk> 
 & gt me : here you go 
 & gt marl : oh my

 & gt me : have fun 
 i went back to my coffee drinking 
 _________________ <unk> hours later

 she doesn’t look happy 
 & gt marl : this computer isn’t working 
 i walked out of my office to come help her 
 she handed me the laptop 
 & gt me : what the… 
 why is this laptop so <unk> 
 & gt marl : errr… no idea 
 i looked down at my coffee again 
 it smell like lies again 
 & gt me : why does it smell terrible 
 & gt marl : the vp told me to come get another one… we’re in the middle of a presentation so… can i get another one now 
 & gt me : no 
 the phone rang it was the vp 
 & gt vp : hey airz… sorry about the laptop 
 can you send marketing lady back up to us 
 & gt me : what… happened to the laptop 
 & gt vp : haven’t you seen it yet 
 i looked down at the <unk> laptop in my hand 
 & gt me : nope 
 & gt vp : oh well nothing too bad 
 just my pen leaked and i got a blotch on the laptop ... & gt me : so its a blotch of ink 
 i stared down at the slimy laptop between my fingers & gt vp : don’t worry airz i got some milk and cif and cleaned it right off 
 i don’t think it’ll stain 
 & gt me : sorry… milk 
 & gt vp : haha yep white cleaning <unk> worst the could happen.. white stain right 
 & gt me : and after you cleaned it you tried turning it on 
 & gt vp : oh god no 
 it needs <unk> out 
 thats why the battery is pulled out 
 we just need a dry laptop 
 i looked down at the laptop in my hand 
 & gt me : how <unk> and cif did you use 
 & gt vp : well if you’re going to clean off a stain might as well give the whole thing a wipe down right 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - that was the birth of the smelly loaner laptop from hell 
 next so this just happened 
 i am eagerly <unk> the response however i feel compelled to share what has happened so far 
 back story : a couple weeks ago i was contacted by a friend of an <unk> of mine who runs a very small business and wants to set up a web site where potential clients can see services prices contact information etc 
 now i am a 4th year <unk> <unk> student so although web site design is not my forte - i do have a functional understanding of <unk> and it is semester break so i agree to set this up 
 i go to meet her she shows me some <unk> of what she wants the site to look like and we agree on a price $ 150 pretty sure that is a good deal $ 50 to be payed now and $ 100 upon completion 
 fast forward to last friday 
 i 'm all finished website comes online - i call the client and tell her its all up and running she checks it out loves it its exactly what she wants 
 i give her my account number for her to transfer my payment she thanks me and the call ends 
 now this morning one week later - payment is still not in so i send an email to see whats going on 
 the reply : & gt i have not yet transferred funds 
 and dont hold your breath 
 i signed no written agreement and you have no proof that i <unk> to provide payment 
 let this be a lesson to you 
 & gt thanks for the web site 
 really 
 took me a couple minutes to process what i had just read 
 i should be mad - but i 'm not 
 armed with a <unk> grin a chuckle and <unk> i ssh in : <unk> -r <unk> <unk> @ & lt my servers ip & gt : <unk> rm <unk> <unk> on out first meeting she said she was getting business cards made up with the web site on it 
 hopefully she does n't notice for a while and hands out these cards that point nowhere : p she seems like the kind of person that really would n't check 
 you know - the <unk> of once its there its there for good 
 if she does n't get back to me in like a week i might redirect somewhere ... inappropriate 
 tl dr : pay me by the way i do expect to be hit by all the reddit flak get it in writing 
 well i will save you the trouble 
 i 'm an idiot i know - its all that has been drilled into me for the last 4 years so i should know better 
 but she seemed so nice i really was n't expecting it : / that and i 'm really not too bothered i have been wanting to find an excuse to build a web page just to refresh my knowledge 
 ________ **update : ** so interesting morning 
 9am i just received a call <unk> the call verbatim would mostly <unk> of expletive deleted for sfw reasons 
 but the gist : her : your useless the site is down already 
 lucky i did n't pay you i want my <unk> back 
 me : i 'm sorry but the site you saw was just a demo site to get your approval 
 i took it down and it will remain down until i receive payment 
 *i was going to say until i receive full payment of the $ 200 that we agreed upon 
 but that 's kind of <unk> she can sink to the level of changing the deal but i 'd prefer to take the high road 
 * her : some horrible language that i do n't have the patience to listen to i 'm paying you this monthly charge to keep the site up now put it back up 
 me : i 'm sorry but that monthly charge is for the web server which hosts the site 
 i used a billboard analogy where you pay for the billboard for a period of time but its up to you what you want to put on there 
 i think she got it 
 in hindsight most billboard companies probably put up the add all in one package deal ... but most <unk> fail bearing close <unk> 
 me : and even if that money was coming to me <unk> a short time later i receive an email : & gt what is the login to the account that i am paying for 
 you dont have the right to keep that from me <unk> i am paying it & gt my son is doing computing at <unk> and he copied the site before you took it down so he can rebuild it so there 
 at this point i 'm thinking whatever - i have had enough 
 i am <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> reply about how there is no way he has the <unk> scripts that give most of the functionality when i get another call 
 this time from her son 
 he is so much more irate however i really ca n't hold that against him 
 i 'm sure that he has heard a <unk> version of the story and i can sympathize 
 cross my mum and i will rip your head off and leave you in a shallow grave 
 again summary of the call 
 too many expletive deleted be readable : him : how dare you refuse to give us the access to a payed account i should -- -- ing come over there and kick your -- -- <unk> ass you -- -- 
 me : wow settle down i was just replying to the email with all the credentials you need to access the server 
 she did n't pay me so i took the site down and it will stay that way 
 him : i do this stuff for a living i am the top of my python class you think you can keep the site down well i have news for you i copied the source before you took it down so i can just put it straight back on there i win -- -- er 
 note i used no punctuation in that sentence because he did n't 
 i could picture him turning blue on the other end of the line also add about 20 expletives in there to get an idea of how long he was talking me : look you do what you want i do n't care i will send you the credentials and i do n't want to hear from you again 
 all emails will be forwarded to trash and please loose my number 
 *click* ssh into root account ... rm -f <unk> rm -f <unk> find /bin -not -name cd '' -not -name ls '' -not -name mount '' -not -name chmod '' <unk> f <unk> chmod 000 { } <unk> chmod 000 <unk> passwd -l root <unk> 
 yes 
 unprofessional 
 yes 
 but in the heat of the moment and after hearing what he <unk> to do or thinks he can do there is no <unk> left in this deal 
 they can call the provider and have the os re-installed after they figure out whats wrong 
 they can even choose something easier than <unk> you know with one of those things ... desktops i think they are called 
 and compile the email : & gt username : admin & gt password : admin & gt i have forwarded further emails from you to the bin folder 
 i do not have a call blocking feature on my phone but i can install one with ease 
 do n't make me 
 & gt <unk> 
 goodbye 
 and that 's it 
 will it be the end of the story 
 i hope so 
 <unk> : ** no the password is not really admin 
 for those who do n't know what the commands do 
 the two commands <unk> and sudo allow non root accounts to run commands as root the highest admin 
 the first two lines remove these from the system 
 yes i could have done this more <unk> by changing <unk> but meh the third command finds all files in the /bin directory aside from cd for changing directories and ls for <unk> contents of a directory and mount for mounting drives and then execute the command chmod 000 on each file 
 this removes all read write execute permissions - making them <unk> 
 maybe an expert can tell me if i chmod <unk> mount would that cause boot issues 
 and the /bin directory well lets just say the stuff in there is important 
 the fourth command removes all permissions from the chmod command itself 
 permissions are gone and are n't coming back : finally passwd -l root <unk> the root account 
 which itself is good practice in fact the only reason it was activated in the first place is so i could log into it and run these commands 
 <unk> i get so many comments saying why are you building websites for $ 150 well the answer is because its not my business i was n't out to make a profit 
 someone contacted me and wanted some help building a a site 
 i have the skills at my <unk> along with some spare time so i agreed 
 i was in it to learn and help someone out 
 it was my intention to refresh my memory and get some experience in a skill remotely relating to my future profession because let be honest - its a very useful skill to have 
 as a <unk> student i just quoted twice my weekly budget 
 seems fair to me we are both <unk> 
 turns out i learnt another valuable lesson 
 cant complain i got experience in what i planned to and some bonus experience 
 its like when you finish a <unk> on some game and the reward is some experience a little money and a mystery treasure chest that when you open contains a little bit more experience <unk> 
 <unk> : <unk> 
 *me* : <unk> it 's <unk> and i ca n't sleep this tale seems appropriate 
 i routinely submit stories that highlight the benefits of the strong union at my telco and i figure it 's time to post one where the work contract might be a bit more controversial 
 it happened a few months ago 
 phone rang at 3am 
 everyone should be asleep but i 'm not 
 i have a sleep issue - a good night for me is about four hours - might seem shocking but i actually function just fine on that much 
 as a result i 'm often already up - or still up - at 3am as i was on that night 
 & gt networks boss : bytewave 
 sorry to bug you so late but you 're the guy with most seniority who voluntarily approved <unk> overtime for emergencies according to the list and ... '' & gt bytewave : yeah sure 
 do n't apologize 
 i did and i was up plus you know the work contract terms 
 this call ends with me getting paid five hours at twice my hourly rate even if it lasts five minutes - you 're making my night 
 what 's up '' 
 & gt networks boss : switchboard issue 
 charlie and <unk> been down for 75 minutes and even at night that 's a problem the landline queue is red and ... & gt bytewave : wait switchboards 
 the hell that has to do with me 
 switchboards are union too i ca n't do their job without <unk> the work contract you were supposed to call them <unk> ... '' & gt networks boss : i know 
 the night guy there called in sick so we called all his colleagues who <unk> for nighttime overtime like you ... nobody answered 
 my guys ca n't do anything and i figured since senior staff works with switchboards that much and you have access to some tools ... '' hell of a stretch i have little experience troubleshooting switchboard issues on my own even though i work daily with that team ... & gt bytewave : sure if you called every volunteer and got no contact it 's okay to call down based on the emergency overtime protocols 
 but while i 'll do my best for the next five hours as per the <unk> i have zero access to the tools nor much relevant <unk> ... '' & gt networks boss : i know you do n't 
 but i ca n't call anyone else at switchboards - they have to be on the volunteer list otherwise i ca n't even offer overtime between 10pm and <unk> '' 
 oh 
 the guy is n't clueless 
 he actually figured out the work contract faster that i did i must have been a bit <unk> 
 i <unk> a bit - it was late and i did n't expect a manager to get the <unk> without getting hr involved ... anyhow he did the right thing 
 & gt bytewave : ... okay just got it 
 this call being now recorded i have your word that emergency overtime protocols will apply to anyone i can get you '' 
 & gt networks boss : yes obviously ... if you can get me one of switchboards guys i ca n't call ... i 'm not just paying your five hours we 're having lunch tomorrow on me ... '' this is why you want to be on the emergency list - assuming you also do n't really get to sleep at night anyhow 
 i send a mass text to my contacts at switchboards first and once that fails i call my best contact over there 
 & gt <unk> : <unk> ... <unk> fuck 
 it 's like 4am who is this '' 
 & gt bytewave : bytewave 
 got an hour 's work that 's going to pay off more than a day 's and i knew you could use the cash 
 i 'll wait if you need some coffee first ... '' he did n't 
 he was thrilled - that 's the only thing i actually did there calling the guy who i knew would be all over this even if he had n't signed off on nighttime ot 
 once i explained ... & gt <unk> : damn 
 i should sign up for the emergency list 
 logging in my telework station now ... should be able to fix this quick ... '' & gt bytewave : some people need to sleep at night but i figured ten hours worth of pay was n't something you 'd pass up haha 
 i 'll tell networks manager that you 're on it ... and that you 're having lunch with us tomorrow on his dime 
 least he can do '' 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 work in broadband tech support and a lot of people think we 're there to fix their pc 
 had an old boy on the phone telling me his pc was n't working 
 generally i will listen to their problem and offer some advice but tell them there is n't much else i can do due to my support scope 
 anyway his pc was n't turning on and he was taking me through the steps he 's already taken to try sort it 
 unplugging checking cables etc 
 he them told me that he tried taking the ram out and <unk> the contacts with <unk> ... so that was <unk> work for a managed hosting company in the uk but we work across multiple <unk> 
 that 's not the focus of the story however 
 so within $ company we have a prize 
 a <unk> 
 a badge of honour as such 
 it 's ... a rubber chicken 
 a bit strange really 
 i 've been part of the company since mid november and am still learning how to do the job my first job in the industry along with the weird <unk> and <unk> that come with every workplace 
 i learned the <unk> of the chicken today 
 $ company provides a managed hosting service where we install a rack into your building 
 customers are then ordered not to touch it or face the wrath of a void warranty 
 as we do n't go out to the customer site to troubleshoot unless we really have to we ca n't tell if the customer has opened the rack or not 
 not for maybe months on end anyway 
 what we do or maybe did is place a 4 '' rubber chicken in the rack strapped to the door 
 if a customer were to open the rack a rather confused call to the service desk asking why that particular piece of hardware had been installed would follow 
 $ company used a rubber chicken as a warranty test 
 the rubber chicken is now a sign of <unk> integrity respect <unk> and humour in a sometimes stressful workplace 
 and i won one 
 edit : a lot of people telling me better ways to test for an opened rack 
 the chicken was discontinued as a reliable source a couple years ago 
 it was only ever used as an inside joke as it were 
 edit 2 : to win said chicken i demonstrated one of the <unk> above and was <unk> by the manglement 
 one of my contracts that still brings me nightmares was at a food production factory 
 long story short but i went from new guy to it manager literally overnight 
 i remember this incident clearly 
 & gt ticket : can not log on to new computer in production area 5. there was the usual <unk> about some error messages and how it was working the other day and that it 's of the utmost importance they always are 
 i send the tech over to the computer and he calls me back after half an hour 
 & gt tech : there 's something seriously wrong here 
 i ca n't log on to it using my domain account on either socket 
 my laptop wo n't connect either but both sockets are patched 
 i 've tried my laptop on a different socket and it works there 
 & gt me : ca n't be the connection as the cable only went in yesterday and it 's certified 
 & gt tech : can you come and have a look 
 i do n't know anything about cabling 
 me & gt i 'm on my way 
 i walked over with my cabling tools and a couple of screwdrivers and took the socket apart 
 despite a wiring diagram on the back of the socket there was not one of the 8 wires in the right place 
 i <unk> it correctly then headed for the cabinet 
 in the cabinet room i found the socket on the patch panel and checked that 
 it too was incorrectly wired despite a detailed diagram 
 i wired that up correctly too and called back the tech 
 & gt me : try that computer now 
 & gt tech : *after a minute or <unk> that 's better we have a connection 
 i 've just seen the cabling guys - do you want me to send them to you 
 & gt me : yes please 
 i 'm in the cabinet room send them down here 
 five minutes later two young lads arrived in the small room where the network cabinet had been located 
 & gt me : i 've just had to <unk> a port completely as both ends were incorrectly wired 
 & gt cable guy 1 : well we wired it to the standards so i do n't understand why 
 & gt me : each socket has a map on the back of it that tells you where each wire goes 
 how did you not read that 
 & gt cable guy 2 : those are n't the current standards 
 they 're wrong 
 & gt me : i do n't have time to disagree with you so here 's what you 're going to do 
 all of the data points that you 've put in need to be <unk> and terminated according to the little map on the back of the socket and the patch panel 
 if you ca n't or wo n't do that then i 'll find a contractor who can 
 & gt cable guy 1 : so these are data points and not phone sockets 
 & gt me : ... do they <unk> like phone sockets 
 & gt cable guy 1 : well no but ... & gt me : just get it done how i said <unk> do this stuff for long enough you run into situations like this one i dealt with friday and today 
 i 'm an it consultant 
 that means i 'm good with computers 
 how good 
 well for instance i installed a phone recently in just under four hours 
 how did i do it so quickly 
 so glad you asked 
 here is my tale of woe 
 <unk> two new follycom <unk> 
 hook them up 
 they get an ip 
 web interface comes up 
 look up default password and enter it 
 it does not work 
 try the default sip password for this environment in case it pulled itself a config somehow 
 does not work 
 try previous firmware version default passwords 
 does not work 
 try accessing the advanced config of the phone directly rather than through web interface does not work 
 hook up second phone with the included <unk> <unk> so it wont connect to the network 
 attempt to log in with default password 
 does not work 
 no other random <unk> mary passwords work 
 look up password reset procedure which suggests two different <unk> combinations to hold during boot to initiate reset 
 try to find out which combo one applies to this phone 
 one person says combo a. try combo a. get to a screen that reads 'reset phone configuration and asks for password which should be the mac address of the phone 
 this phone has a 9 key <unk> so to enter letters you need to tap the numbers multiple times to cycle through the letters like an old flip phone 
 best part is that for security the characters are shown as asterisks so you are <unk> through the letters but can not see them 
 manual says to enter the letters in lowercase not capital 
 finish entering mac address 
 <unk> password 
 get frustrated and leave for the day 
 return today 
 notice there is an additional follycom phone speakerphone installed previously that is working normally this is unusual because the other phones here are a different brand 
 look at its configuration 
 it is apparently accessing a completely different config server than the one used at this location 
 no one knows who set it up 
 become very confused 
 attempt to log into this phone with the default password 
 does not work 
 try sip password does not work 
 try sip username and password does not work 
 try multiple combinations of the above 
 does not work 
 attempt to login to the config server it is apparently connecting to 
 invalid password 
 no idea what the correct one is 
 partner in crime shows up 
 finds a completely random phone password somewhere on the server that neither of us have heard of which matches a sticker i never noticed on the back of the phone 
 log into this phone successfully and change the password 
 still can not log into the new phones 
 try the other key combination combo b that was suggested during boot to see what it does 
 end up at a different looking screen that also says 'reset configuration and prompts for password 
 enter mac address 
 it neither accepts nor rejects the password just goes to the main menu 
 attempt to log in to advanced config on the phone 
 does not work 
 attempt to log in with mac address 
 does not work 
 provision a sip extension associated with the mac address of this phone and restart it 
 try logging in with sip password 
 does not work 
 not really surprised because i was n't able to configure it to point it to the sip server 
 find random blog dude online that drove himself nuts because of this exact problem on this exact phone 
 see that he mentions that it only reset for him when he did the configuration reset with capital letters when entering the mac address even though as he reminds the reader all follycom documentation indicates that it should be done with lowercase letters 
 reboot the phone holding combo b again and enter the mac address with capital letters 
 still no acceptance or <unk> of the password 
 try to log in with web interface 
 invalid password 
 partner in crime points out that a <unk> on aforementioned random blog said that the reset keypad combo only worked for him when he pressed the cancel button halfway through boot process of the phone then held down the combo during the 10 second countdown shown before it <unk> 
 begin performing this procedure but the auto reboot has already begun when partner in crime finishes explaining it 
 restart the phone 
 press cancel halfway 
 hold down key combo a this time 
 enter mac address in the interface using capital letters when prompted not lowercase 
 accepts password 
 phone reboots 
 enter default admin password in web interface 
 password is accepted 
 wife picks me up 
 asks me what i did at work today 
 have no idea how to <unk> story from my magical job at that now closed dial-up company 
 ***** i had been at the company now for a year and a half or so was there slightly over 2 years and had become good friends with some of our <unk> - aka repeat callers 
 if you have ever worked at a small company and have regulars you know how it goes 
 you see their phone number on the caller id and you know who it is and what the problem is before picking up the receiver 
 some of the regulars were not so nice and were not friends - they were more like enemies to be treated politely so as to get them off the phone as fast as possible with as little stress as possible 
 one of these repeat enemies - <unk> ... callers - claimed to be a professor at a local college in it 's engineering department and all the time talked about the <unk> in spending after it got paired with a much larger college near the northern <unk> if you are from <unk> you already know which college it is 
 he was very <unk> and because he was so smart had a <unk> '' and taught a <unk> <unk> not a <unk> industry like it that he was better than me and all the other techs 
 you could hear the disdain in his voice everytime he called 
 you could tell he thought we were beneath him and should service his every <unk> 
 well after dealing with him for months and his disdain over everything - even calling me a liar when i explained to him how noise on the phoneline interfered with the signal - i finally got the <unk> '' of a call from him 
 as an explanation of the lie '' about noise on the lines - being an engineer '' he was too smart to fall for the lies of interference and instead kept telling me how noise on the line was n't possible because it was against electrical <unk> properties or some such thing 
 anyway he calls in one day and claims to have a bought a new computer and wants us to walk him through setting up the connection - aka the only useful damn thing you <unk> can do '' 
 that is an exact quote from that call 
 after doing the usual steps and being ready to get him off the phone i tell him he will have to hang up to then <unk> and try the service 
 but wait my friends he is an engineer 
 he thought ahead 
 he was on his brand new portable <unk> <unk> device 
 crying <unk> i went into robot mode and waited as he tried to dial up 
 <unk> 
 <unk> 
 <unk> 
 by the 4th attempt it was obvious he was getting no dial-tone 
 i asked him to double check to make sure the phone cord was connected at the wall and at the computer 
 he got mad and cussed at me but then <unk> it was 
 i even had him <unk> both ends until he heard the <unk> just to make sure it was firmly seated 
 after he tried again still no dial-tone i concluded his pc had a bad modem from the factory it happens modems were <unk> devices and had terrible failure rates and as i was starting to suggest this he cut me off and stated the following gem of wisdom : ***** i do n't need a modem 
 this new pc has a universal serial bus port 
 i just <unk> the end of the phone line with a pair of pliers and <unk> it into that port 
 it is universal so that means it will fit and use anything '' 
 ***** i was stunned 
 beyond stunned 
 he was a self proclaimed engineer and useful member of society '' and i was a useless it <unk> '' 
 yet to hear him admit to purposely <unk> and <unk> a phone jack and usb port i have no idea how he fit it in there even <unk> with a pair of pliers just floored me 
 at this point i just started laughing 
 it was all i could do 
 i laughed hard and long 
 the more he got mad and yelled and cussed at me the more i laughed 
 after a few minutes i calmed down enough to tell him to take his brand new computer to his it department on campus and have them explain to him why what he did would n't work 
 later that month he sent a <unk> <unk> letter to us asking us to disconnect him from the service because our dial-up did not work with universal sandwiches - yes a direct quote from his letter 
 ***** tl dr - usb will work with anything even if it does n't fit 
 ***** edit 4 - to the <unk> : i ca n't count that high so i ca n't keep track of the upvotes 
 for everyone else - thank you for the hilarious stories that are similar to this <unk> i volunteer at the local senior center computer lab 
 today a lady came in asking for help with her new cell phone 
 she says that she can call people just fine but when other people call her it does n't come through 
 first step is obviously to verify the problem -- i ask her what her cell phone number is and then call it from my own cell phone 
 sure enough her phone does n't ring <unk> or in any way indicate that there 's a problem 
 second step is to make sure that i have the right number so i call my own cell phone from hers 
 a different number pops up which i show her 
 $ lady : oh that 's my cell phone number '' 
 $ me : then what number was i just calling '' 
 $ lady : my home phone number 
 do i need to give people my cell phone number instead '' 
 $ me : ... yes your cell phone uses your cell phone number 
 promotions to technical support senior staff at my telco my job requires both a certain seniority and the ability to pass 5 different exams 
 each of them is overkill and you need 75 % on each precisely to reduce the impact of seniority in the process 
 we want to make sure every employee in the department has broad skills 
 i sometimes grade these exams but not always 
 besides that potentials are normally offered to do the job temporarily - at reduced pay sadly a <unk> in the work contract 
 officially it 's so they can get a feel for the job and make sure it suits them unofficially it 's so the rest of the team makes sure they 're a good fit 
 that day there 's a prospect named justin sitting right next to me and i 'm <unk> on his calls a bit 
 obviously i 'm only hearing one side of the conversation i 'm not tapped into his line 
 & gt justin : no no he tested with two different computers there 's no way we 're telling the customer to see a computer technician until we confirmed the problem is not on our end 
 that happens way too much i wo n't ok it 
 if need be we 'll send a road tech with a clean laptop to replicate '' 
 ... & gt justin : no it 's not bull 
 use the <unk> tools 
 three levels down under internet you 'll find a logging tool more people should use 
 yeah that one 
 everytime a new mac is plugged in we have records 
 customers ca n't lie about their tests 
 there 's three in the last hour in his log just like he said his router and two separate computers plugged in straight 
 none of the three was granted a valid public ip '' 
 ... & gt justin : no that 's just not possible 
 these are network logs entirely on our end 
 the only way i could see what i 'm looking at and the data 's wrong is if the customer <unk> macs 
 but that 's not the case because the data usage logging tool shows his issue is real 
 look at the history over 72 hours we do n't even have <unk> from the modem 
 i 'll edit your ticket and escalate to networks - you need to tell the customer there 's a real problem on our end '' 
 ... & gt justin : yes i know you already told him it was on his end but you were wrong 
 mistakes happen but it 's no reason to just send him into a dead end 
 <unk> is part of the job description 
 i 'm also putting him on the recall list he 'll have a follow up about this soon '' 
 i was pretty impressed new guys typically roll over or fail to counter properly in cases like this where their frontline tech is clearly pushing them to a course of action often to avoid losing face 
 he stood up like the best of us do understood every aspect of the problem explained why thoroughly taught his agent about tools he should have used and was more diplomatic than i would have been about the whole thing 
 i wanted him in 
 i waited till his ticket was escalated to networks 
 the problem was related to the pmd and they solved it in short order 
 the customer had been offline for nearly three days and it was his third call to technical support 
 so i went to see the guy in charge of grading justin 's exams to ask how well he did 
 & gt stephan : eh not so bad but he failed one 
 72 % on hardlines 
 did rate over 90 % on internet and mobile '' 
 that means he ca n't have the job 
 got ta have 75 % on all five 
 & gt bytewave : turned in to management and the union already '' 
 & gt stephan : no '' 
 & gt bytewave : grade it again '' 
 & gt stephan : i do like him too 
 you sure '' 
 & gt bytewave : yes '' 
 justin is the newest employee promoted to tsss 
 looks like he actually got <unk> % on hardlines 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 the year was 1992 and the details are a little <unk> 
 but i walked into the math office at the college i was attending and their student employee was screaming at the computer which was beeping back at her 
 what i eventually determined was this : she was using word perfect 
 word perfect <unk> <unk> '' where you could type keys while the computer was busy and it would hold them for you and apply them when it was ready 
 she had gotten herself into some corner and could n't get out of it 
 she hit the escape key 
 the escape key beeped and printed some kind of error message on the screen delete something you typed '' or something like that for one second 
 she did not read the message and hit esc 
 beep one second 
 esc esc esc esc esc beep one second beep one second esc esc esc esc esc beep one second beep one second esc esc esc esc esc beep one second beep one second me : having read the error message can you please stop doing that '' 
 her : but i need it to stop '' 
 esc esc esc esc esc beep one second beep one second me : can you please just stop so i can look at the computer '' 
 her : but i need it to stop '' 
 esc esc esc esc esc beep one second beep one second esc esc esc esc esc beep one second beep one second i walked out 
 the secretary asked if i fixed it because the beeping is driving her crazy 
 i told the secretary that if the girl would just stop hitting esc then sooner or later it will stop beeping then she should read the error message and do what it says 
 but i told her i ca n't get her to stop hitting esc 
 i wished her good luck and went on my way 
 previous redcheer our new tech sat next to me as i picked up the first call of the day 
 it was the head of accounting 
 & gt headac : how do you delete stuff 
 & gt me : redcheer you can take the lead on this call 
 redcheer looked excited at her first call 
 & gt redcheer : okay just click what you want then drop it in the trash bin 
 & gt headac : i know that 
 i mean delete <unk> 
 redcheer looked confused 
 she continued on regardless 
 & gt redcheer : right click the trash bin then empty the trash 
 it’ll be gone 
 & gt headac : no 
 i mean permanently 
 i smiled as i realized this was perfect first call for a tech 
 i took a sip of coffee and sat back in my chair waiting to see how the call <unk> out 
 & gt redcheer : if you do that it’ll be gone 
 forever 
 never to be seen again 
 & gt headac : i need to make sure it can never be retrieved 
 odd i thought accounts hate things being deleted normally 
 & gt redcheer : err… yeah no one will retrieve it 
 i think… 
 & gt headac : oh god are you <unk> of anything 
 listen airz… are you still there 
 i mumbled yes as i saw a look of annoyance and anger 
 settling over redcheers face 
 & gt headac : can you come up and take a look 
 please 
 i agreed to accounts request mostly because i was curious what type of file did they want to delete 
 it wasn’t until the stairs that redcheer started talking again i hadn’t even realized she was following me up to accounting 
 & gt redcheer : i learnt a bunch of tech words over the weekend 
 so can i take the lead again … i think i can do this 
 i looked down and saw a fire in her eyes 
 & gt me : ummm okay 
 getting to the head <unk> office i was met with a smile however when the head accountant saw redcheer his face went into frown 
 redcheer looked down at the computer in front of her 
 & gt redcheer : which file needs deleting 
 the head of accounts selected out the file i took a look at the file name <unk> <unk> department fund 2 - year <unk> redcheer took the file and dragged it into the bin then cleared the bin 
 & gt headac : no no i looked online and i found a whole bunch of things saying you can retrieve files that are deleted like that 
 they told me i had to write over the file at least 10 times to be safe or something 
 & gt redcheer : nope 
 its gone 
 wave goodbye 
 i smirked at the attitude but the head accountant was technically <unk> & gt headac : look i’ll show you it can come back 
 the head accountant then opened a recovery program to retrieve the file 
 before it could complete he continued 
 & gt headac : see it’ll get the file back 
 i tried to delete it using <unk> of <unk> but it always comes back 
 i had a sinking feeling 
 <unk> of <unk> is always a bad expression 
 & gt me : what… er… tools specifically 
 redcheer looked annoyed i was taking over her call again 
 i however was too busy looking down at the mess of a start bar 
 <unk> of recovery tools <unk> of <unk> tools 
 & gt me : please… tell me you didn’t disable the firewall to install all that 
 & gt headac : err 
 & gt redcheer : don’t worry airz i got this 
 redcheer turned the head of accounting to face her 
 she looked him dead in the eyes 
 & gt redcheer : are you insane 
 do you know what a <unk> is 
 head of accounting looked scared 
 he shook his head 
 redcheer was almost shouting at his face 
 & gt redcheer : or a <unk> 
 or a <unk> 
 have you ever thought what could happen with one compromised pc on the network 
 you could <unk> everything 
 now we’re got ta take this pc away 
 we’re gon na have to wipe it 
 do you know how much work you’ve just created for us 
 security reviews <unk> the network port tracing shaking out the <unk> downloading the patch fixes for the <unk> at this point i was fairly sure she was just <unk> 
 i decided the utterly white faced head of accounting probably had enough 
 & gt me : okay thats enough 
 we’re gon na have to take your pc and scrub it 
 the head of accounting flopped down on his desk looked scared 
 redcheer’s demeanor went back from scary to nice almost instantly 
 she started packing up his computer for <unk> turning off the recovery program 
 & gt redcheer : oh i almost forgot 
 she smiled down <unk> at the head of accounting 
 who looked up at her in disbelief 
 & gt redcheer : will you need a loaner pc while we’re fixing this one 
 & gt headac : no 
 no not if its more work for you 
 i think i’ve caused enough trouble with <unk> tracing of <unk> for <unk> or … whatever 
 redcheer smiled as she left with the tower 
 i looked down at the visibly shaken head of accounting 
 & gt headac : airz is that your new tech 
 & gt me : yeah… & gt headac : send her up again for all accounting calls 
 she knows her stuff 
 next ***** please check out a comic of the first story here : so i am here casually at college fixing computers when i receive an <unk> call from my friend 
 my dad installed windows 10 and my computer is now stuck in a reboot loop '' 
 i immediately knew what this referred to 
 the old drivers from windows 7 <unk> with windows 10. once i had done my computer repairs i drove to my friend 's place 
 it 's a free service at the college that i am a student at 
 computer tech students like me fix people 's computers for free 
 so i started by confirming that the issue is real 
 it was so i pulled out my linux thumb drive from my pocket and plugged it in 
 booted into linux 
 we then asked his dad if he wanted to save any data that may exist on the computer 
 he did n't want to so we continued with formatting the ssd windows 10 was on 
 we had just finished formatting when his dad comes and sees linux on the screen 
 his dad is a <unk> 
 he promptly <unk> the computer and puts it in his garage 
 & gt '' do n't you & amp <unk> % # ing put linux on my son 's computer '' 
 i continue explaining the situation and he ends up kicking me off of the property and <unk> his computer for a week 
 and then he starts blaming my friend for breaking the computer even worse 
 tl dr i was in the process of fixing friend 's computer friend 's dad got angry seeing linux <unk> the reinstallation of <unk> and blamed my friend for the computer not having a os 
 update : i am currently at his place fixing the computer and finishing my job up 
 the linux usb drive was still attached thank god 
 it 's installing windows 10. update 2 : the <unk> is over 
 everything works as intended and i did not end up getting <unk> <unk> up my ass 
 i managed to leave about 3 minutes before his dad came home hey guys long time lurker & amp first time poster here 
 so i work at a standard $ isp and i answer to techsupport calls directly from customers 
 so this customer calls in because her tv is black and says no signal '' which is usually a clear sign that the tv has the wrong source selected 
 so i 'm trying to guide her to change source 
 i 'm $ siv and she will be $ cm & gt $ siv : can you try switching source on your tv to hdmi 1 
 & gt $ cm : i do n't have anything named hdmi 1 
 & gt $ siv : alright how many hdmi ports does your tv have 
 & gt $ cm : it does n't have any hdmi ports at all 
 & gt $ siv : uh okey 
 do you use <unk> 
 & gt $ cm : no 
 i do n't use any of that 
 i use something called <unk> <unk> 
 have you guys never heard of that 
 *deep deep sigh 
 * & gt $ siv : right ... can you switch over to <unk> <unk> for me then 
 & gt $ cm : oh now it works 
 thanks 
 *click* i just do n't get customers sometimes 
 edit : apparently i ca n't spell <unk> 's it guys 
 i just got the call '' 
 the one we all dread 
 the worst part by far is that i work in a place of higher education and this call was from a professor 
 i work at a state university in video conferencing 
 being such a large state and so removed from the rest of the country we rely heavily on distance education 
 i get a call from the help desk they have a customer who is experiencing problems in one of our rooms 
 they transfer him to me 
 the instructor tells me that the monitor says no signal '' 
 after <unk> that he was talking about the <unk> monitor and not the television used for his video conference i figure it has to be a cable problem 
 people ca n't possibly forget to turn their computer on 
 that 's just something that happens in movies and tv right 
 well ... & gt me : okay so the first thing i have to ask is the computer powered on '' 
 & gt & gt instructor : well i would assume so 
 i 've never had to power it on or off before '' 
 oh god 
 please 
 & gt me : okay can we try pressing the power button on the computer '' 
 his next line 
 & gt instructor : where is it 
 all i see is a little box that says <unk> ... '' this man is teaching the next generation of great <unk> 
 *edit : holy crap 1st on page 
 you all rock 
 not bad for my first reddit post ... *first post lurker blah blah blah details have been changed to protect my <unk> 
 **background** i work for a three letter agency as a contractor 
 i am one of several sys admins working in the operations center / network operations center we build all the networks servers are responsible for all hardware/software maintain everything and <unk> <unk> ... except for it security 
 it security is run by another contracting firm that builds <unk> <unk> <unk> and is responsible for all the security monitoring av servers etc on our networks 
 it is important to note that we have zero access to their servers security tools logs etc 
 needless to say we don’t get <unk> recently it has gotten worse as the head of it security just came back from what he calls an <unk> <unk> security conference and has received many demo programs that will greatly increase our security *the last <unk> <unk> he put on the network declared our exchange server a mass mailing <unk> but i <unk> 
 starts out as a typical day checking up on our servers doing tickets shooting the shit amongst ourselves and generally just having a good time 
 **ding** * -- email from it <unk> we’ve been hacked 
 emergency 
 critical 
 many viruses have been detected on the network 
 <unk> fuck 
 * we are of course scratching our heads 
 note that we built the network and it is about as flimsy as a brick <unk> we hardened the ever living hell <unk> it 
 the chances of someone <unk> in* are <unk> small 
 we send an email to it security and cc our teams and the fed managers asking for more details : eg 
 what has been <unk> where did this occur etc you know common sense stuff 
 **ding** -- e-mail from it security : we’ve been hacked 
 emergency 
 critical 
 <unk> viruses have been detected in multiple locations many systems infected 
 breach 
 breach 
 breach 
 <unk> apparently details are a foreign <unk> at this point my manager is on the phone with 3 different feds who are all screaming and waving their hands around demanding to know how <unk> allowed a breach what <unk> are doing to fix it etc 
 my manager calmly explains that we are looking into it but need all the records it security has on the incident so we can actually have a starting point 
 feds grumble agree and apparently send a <unk> to the it security room instructing them to send us all the records they don’t want to stop berating my manager apparently and simply sending an e-mail was for some reason not fast <unk> 
 10 minutes pass **ding** -- email from it security <unk> well pretty much every manager in the entire agency : it security will be taking the lead on this 
 <unk> does not have the tools <unk> experience <unk> 
 * or knowledge <unk> to handle a security event of this magnitude 
 ……… 
 after <unk> <unk> of back and forth btw us it security and what had to be 40 feds up to and including the head of the agency we get 2 screen shots from it security which they say is all the records they <unk> 
 at the time we thought they were just holding out on us and playing politics but what the hell at least we have something to frigging work on 
 first thing i notice is that only 1 computer a desktop is listed as being <unk> and the path of the infected files are on the e : / <unk> is the bloody cd-rom drive 
 ** wondering who the <unk> this computer is assigned to i check the logs find the <unk> 
 and just stare stunned at the screen for 30 seconds 
 i start to laugh 
 my manager runs over and <unk> asks me what’s so funny 
 i can’t stop laughing and just point to the logs 
 my manager glances at the logs does a double take checks the screenshot from it security and starts laughing 
 hilarity <unk> as one by one other admins come and look at what i’ve found 
 the sound <unk> one of our main fed managers who storms in demanding to know what exactly we find funny about the current situation 
 we explain that according to what was sent to us from it security there is only 1 computer <unk> as <unk> 
 that the infected files seem to be on a cd-rom and that the desktop current assigned user is the <unk> of it security** 
 apparently at the security conference cd’s with tools and <unk> of products were handed out to all <unk> 
 one of the tool cd’s included examples of virus coding not the viruses themselves as well as some useful networking and security tools 
 this cd is clearly labeled with : ** warning : not to be placed on a production <unk> this of course was the cd he put into his production desktop right before leaving the room so he missed all the popups warning a virus had been found 
 when the alerts started appearing he bypassed his desk and went to hover mode behind his <unk> and never noticed it was his desktop that had <unk> and infected the <unk> 
 needless to say their company is currently in the process of being replaced 
 edit : grammar spelling wow thanks for all the up votes and comments 
 my friend tried to host some minecraft servers on the various computers in his house and his network stopped working 
 he told me he had set static ips on his computers which is fine 
 i spent an hour investigating and could n't find anything wrong 
 i eventually checked the ipv4 addresses of the computers and found out he had set them all to the same address 
 tl dr 10 people in a group with the same name gets <unk> situation i 'm sure is familiar to most of you the old fix it on your time mine is too valuable '' 
 a call comes in saying their excel <unk> for one of their <unk> programs is n't working 
 i remote into his machine as per usual when someone asks me for help 
 & gt $ user : what are you doing on my machine 
 & gt me : umm 
 fixing your issue 
 & gt $ user : not now 
 i have too much to do 
 do it after 4 
 & gt me : i would but i leave at 3 so let me know a time that works for you 
 a few minutes later i get an email saying i can take a look 
 i jump on and see the program needs to be updated no big deal 
 i take care of the update and give him a call back to sign in to test it 
 no answer 
 i call back a few minutes later 
 no answer 
 i call $ friend who sits next to him 
 & gt me : is $ user there 
 & gt $ friend : nah he ran to the gym 
 what 's up 
 & gt me : ... tell him to give me a call back when he gets back 
 **the gym 
 ** i leave a sticky note on his screen to call me when he returns and go about my business 
 an hour later i receive a call from $ user : & gt $ user : is this finished yet 
 this is taking way too long this is ridiculous 
 & gt me : i have been waiting the last 45 minutes for you to get back from the gym 
 not that you 're back lets go ahead and test that <unk> 
 it works 
 and it 's only <unk> that we 're in the last few weeks leading up to the new semester we 're getting a lot of calls from new students trying to get all of their accounts set up 
 unfortunately we 're also getting a lot of calls from their overbearing mothers 
 this is one of those : <unk> sounding person on the phone* i ca n't get logged in 
 the account name is username '' 
 <unk> up account with a date of birth in <unk> and is this your personal account '' 
 no it 's my daughter 's obviously '' 
 oh i see 
 unfortunately due to security policy we have to speak to the user whose name is on the account so she 'll need to call '' 
 but i 'm her mother '' 
 i understand but i ca n't verify that and even if i could i still would not be able to talk to you about her account '' 
 that 's just stupid 
 you just do n't want to have to do any work 
 obviously i 'm her mother 
 she gave me her password 
 now just fix it so i can log in '' 
 again i apologize that there 's not more that i can do for you but security policy at the university <unk> me from resetting her password for someone else 
 technically just the suggestion that she 's given out her password to other people and the fact that an unknown person is trying to access her account is reason enough for me to lock the account and make her come in and reset it in person but i 'd rather not do that to -- '' i do n't care 
 why are you making this so difficult 
 you could have reset it by now 
 just do your damn job already '' 
 *sigh* ok ma'am 
 one moment '' 
 ticka ticka ticka ok it 's done '' 
 what 's done 
 you 're reset the password '' 
 no ma'am 
 i 've followed our procedure for dealing with possible third party <unk> and locked the user 's account 
 i 've also put a note on it that she 'll need to come in in person to reset it so we can verify her '' 
 you 've done what '' 
 after that the rest of the call was mostly a lot of <unk> swearing 
 edit : to save future <unk> time <unk> the us <unk> regulation that applies here has been mentioned and explained about a dozen times below 
 that 's probably plenty 
 anticlimactic update : she came in 
 why was my account locked '' 
 someone was trying to access your account so we locked it for your security '' 
 yeah that was my mom '' 
 but we have no way to verify that '' 
 oh ... ok. well thanks '' 
 sorry folks they ca n't all be <unk> used to work at a college as a unix <unk> developer 
 one winter i was bored and took a paper process teachers were using and put it on the web 
 this process used to take weeks t collate and now had the potential to be automated to a large extent and completed in days 
 it still required the teachers to log in and verify information 
 the teachers were not happy about this because they hate change and made up excuses why they could n't complete it 
 then i started to get the calls about issues my favorite was non-existent errors that went something like this <unk> teacher : i tried to login but it said i am not authorized to log in me : what was the exact error message teacher : you are not allowed to use this system '' me : it does not say that please tell me exactly what the error you are looking at says teacher : it does say that how could you possibly know what my screen says this system is broken and i ca n't complete my work 
 me : i know this because in addition to coding this system ... i also coded all the error messages and that is not something i coded teacher : *silence* me : would you like to actually try <unk> in and let me know if there are any problems teacher : *hangs up* edit : want to thank everyone for the upvotes far an away the most popular post i have made to reddit so glad everyone enjoyed it 
 i will share some more of my tech support stories thank you all and have a great day user : can i also have the locking locking station so i can secure it at my desk 
 me : by locking locking station did you mean locking docking station 
 user : yes 
 me : i have heard of laptop locks and laptop <unk> so a locking dock for docking locking laptops probably exists but i doubt a locking docking laptop with lock is in stock so they may have to order it which will take <unk> extra days 
 i will include the request for this in your order 
 user : <unk> afternoon is a <unk> beast 
 it <unk> the promise of the weekend and the only good kind of downtime 
 on the other hand it also carries a subtle aura of danger 
 everyone knows any time you touch anything on a friday you <unk> increase your chances of having a bad time 
 i didn’t touch anything that friday 
 i don’t know what i did to the gods of networking but i suppose i missed one of the mandatory chicken sacrifices that we’re all so fond of aside from the mess nothing gets chicken out no matter where you file it 
 the call came in from a friend of a friend the operator of an online store who had a dns server that was <unk> 
 it was on my way home so i figured what the hell i’ll help him out 
 i left work at 5 on the dot and drove to their site 
 if i’d have known what i was about to walk into i would have never taken the call 
 by the time i got there the two engineers were frantic 
 i couldn’t get <unk> attention at first but when one of them realised who i was and why i was there his eyes widened and he stormed towards me 
 expecting a blast of abuse of some kind i braced for impact .. then his voice cracked 
 & gt server tech : oh god thank god you’re here fuck everything is fucked shit fuck .. his voice <unk> off into a <unk> <unk> of cursing and muttering when his boss took over the conversation realising his subordinate was not <unk> with the situation 
 & gt chhopsky : what’s going on 
 & gt boss : i’m not going to lie to you - it’s bad 
 real bad 
 at first we thought it was just the dns server but more of them have been dropping offline 
 we don’t know what’s going on and we don’t know how to fix it 
 & gt chhopsky : okay cool - i’ll take a look 
 when i started to look into it i became confused 
 the dns servers were definitely all gone and the monitoring showed more and more of them going offline 
 by the time i started to suspect some sort of switch <unk> and put a console on some of the networking gear it was already too late 
 i just didn’t know it yet 
 the switch was functioning perfectly and while i was throwing <unk> commands at it it rebooted from underneath me 
 what the hell 
 confused i moved over to the routers 
 they too were working perfectly .. and then they too rebooted out from under me 
 was my serial cable <unk> the console port 
 was i causing these reboots 
 or were the reboots causing intermittent faults 
 was it bad power that intermittently killed every network device in some way 
 it could explain a lot 
 <unk> i moved onto the firewalls 
 by the time i got to them they were already rebooting 
 i’d missed it again and i didn’t have any <unk> on 
 but what was causing it 
 i decided to let it reboot and watch it come back up when i saw something that no engineer wants to see 
 & gt would you like to enter the initial configuration prompt 
 yes/no my heart sank 
 what the hell 
 how could it lose it’s config 
 the <unk> configuration was blank 
 and it’s <unk> cluster partner too which was feasible if it <unk> a blank config 
 so i moved back down the chain 
 the routers were blank too 
 & gt chhopsky : <unk> no no no no no no no no the switches were blank 
 the load balancers were blank 
 everything was blank 
 the entire network had been factory defaulted 
 but how could this happen 
 fortunately there was a logging server for the network which amongst other things <unk> every command that was run on every device 
 i got server tech to find it for me and put a keyboard and monitor on it 
 & gt user brad has <unk> with <unk> & gt user brad executed command <unk> & gt user brad executed command <unk> <unk> & gt user brad executed command <unk> & gt user brad has disconnected oh … oh dear 
 that’s how one <unk> the saved configuration of a device and reboots it factory <unk> it 
 & gt chhopsky : … who is brad 
 & gt server tech : he was our last network engineer .. we fired him last week 
 why do you ask 
 & gt chhopsky : did you disable his vpn access 
 if he wasn’t pale enough already he was mighty pale now 
 it turned out they’d had .. concerns about some of <unk> <unk> behaviour 
 after one too many <unk> he was let go 
 i guess he was one of those guys that just has trouble letting go 
 i stared blankly at two racks full of equipment and surveyed the damage 
 the servers still had their os <unk> but he’d deleted everything he had access to which was a lot 
 databases were gone 
 and the network equipment configuration backups were stored in his user account 
 we had nothing but the machines and their operating systems and a large stack of equipment 
 fortunately they had backups at their other site which was 90 minutes drive away 
 i made the call the boss was going to the other office to get the backups and i was going to rebuild the rest from scratch 
 server tech hosed the servers with clean installs while i set to work on the floor of the datacentre figuring out what they had and what i could possibly use it for 
 by the time the boss returned from the drive i’d knocked out a plan and server tech had re-installed all the <unk> and the services they needed 
 backups in hand server tech <unk> the databases and web content while i <unk> and rebuilt the network from our design document that we came up with on the back of a piece of scrap paper 
 i set the firewalls routers and switches up again and configured up <unk> on a pair of new boxes for load balancers as the old ones were dead with some sort of firmware issue most likely <unk> 
 it was 2am when i finished the network 
 server tech had finished his part too but it still wasn’t working 
 there was one final piece of the <unk> missing the databases 
 we were all tired but we pushed through 
 red bull was deployed 
 server tech had <unk> to function 
 in the one lucky break we’d caught all night server tech had forgotten to edit <unk> on the <unk> databases leaving them unconfigured and not functioning 
 a few minutes later we were back online 
 it was <unk> 
 i’d been there for 9 hours and at work for <unk> i got a taxi home cursing the name brad to the gods of networking 
 i <unk> to them that brad would pay for his <unk> 
 that somehow some day he too would find his fate in the hands of someone else who was not kind to his plans 
 fortunately he did 
 and by a complete and utter twist of <unk> fate that person was me so i had a customer today that we shall call betty 
 betty is very nice but also very not good with tech in that 70 something year old who decided to buy a laptop last year kind of way 
 i do my usual <unk> and ask her what she needs help with 
 she tells me that her laptop has a virus 
 now understand that the specific brand of laptop that i work on is very resistant to viruses 
 however many folks especially older folks confuse any and all issues with having a virus 
 so i ask her why she thinks she has s virus and she says because the computer told her it did 
 someone had shown her out to take a screenshot if she ever got a message she did n't understand and she showed it to me 
 yep it was an adware pop up 
 seems betty had been in some video site that said she needed flash so she googled it like a good user but hit the first link which was an adware <unk> site 
 she got one of those fake tech support messages 
 when i asked what she did she told me that she called and they tried to talk her through giving them access to clean up the computer but she could n't understand the instructions so she said she 'd just go to the store and hung up 
 when i told her what they were really up to she said she was never so happy to be stupid 
 i work as a field service and installation technician for a fairly large but not top 5 us <unk> 
 this story takes place over a year ago at a call about bandwidth usage complaints 
 after reading the work order comments seeing that the customer has gone over their bandwidth cap for several months in a row and that they believe the usage problem is our fault i decided to call her 
 nothing about bandwidth <unk> is ever the isp 's fault 
 well except maybe the limit itself 
 <unk> & gt ** $ me : ** hello this is <unk> with $ <unk> 
 i am calling about the trouble call we have scheduled for you today 
 do you have a moment to answer a few questions 
 & gt ** $ cust : ** no i do n't have time 
 i am very busy 
 i just want a tech to come here and fix my problem 
 & gt ** $ me : ** that 's fine 
 just to verify your problem is that you keep going over your bandwidth correct 
 & gt ** $ cust : ** yes and i 'm not the one doing it 
 & gt ** $ me : ** ok ma'am 
 for excessive bandwidth usage there are only three things or a combination <unk> that will cause it 
 first someone could have <unk> your wireless password in some fashion and is using your bandwidth 
 next you could have some malicious software on your computer that is using the bandwidth 
 lastly someone behind your modem is legitimately using that much data and is just unaware 
 & gt ** $ cust : ** i have not used that much data my computer is fine and no one has my wireless password 
 & gt ** $ me : ** if someone wants it bad enough it 's not impossible to obtain a wireless password without consent 
 this is especially true if a password is not very secure 
 & gt ** $ cust : ** i do n't have time for this right now 
 just send the damn technician 
 *click* i sit there for a few moments in anger 
 while i was only 1 minute away in a parking lot i figured it would be best to sit and calm down for a moment 
 after <unk> my composure i roll to the house and greet the customer 
 i enter the home without saying anything unnecessary and proceed to gather my evidence that nothing on our end is wrong 
 at some point when i spoke i believe the customer realized that i was the damn technician '' 
 she started to bark up about her issue and how nothing could be her or her equipment 's problem 
 to avoid any conflict i just say <unk> statements and confirm or deny nothing 
 this seemed to anger the customer as she felt the need to tell me that she was recording our conversation and would report me to my supervisor 
 after i run my tests and get my evidence and logical arguments in order i start to explain to the customer that there is no way that someone can tap in to her internet by splicing in to the line outside 
 the issue has to be one of the ones i told her earlier over the phone 
 the customer then yells at me more telling me that she works in the it department for $ hospital and that i do n't need to <unk> her with this information 
 i do n't know how i am going to win this battle 
 well i started to speak with the customer about things *other* than the issue while i was running more tests '' 
 she was resistant at first but eventually started talking and sounding happier 
 i slowly get back to the issue and she surprisingly does n't rip my head off 
 i explain to her that while i do n't know the true cause of her issue it has to be one of the things i told her before 
 i then mention that she has the ability to track her bandwidth usage with our online account tools 
 when we <unk> in to it we see that every month she only used about 100gb of data or less until three months prior right when her new neighbors moved in 
 i help her <unk> that they could have sniffed out her password as she was still using the default wep password 
 i advised she change her password and then monitor her usage via the online tool 
 turns out one being happy makes them more <unk> to ideas they do n't like 
 edit : <unk> : retail i.t 
 how can i help you 
 associate : i can’t find my ipod 
 me : ok… 
 umm i don’t recall the store having <unk> 
 associate : it’s not a store ipod 
 it’s mine 
 it was at the store and now i can’t find it 
 me : ok… well this is i.t 
 support for store related issues 
 i can’t help you with your lost ipod 
 associate : well i lost it at the store 
 what’s constitutes a store related issue 
 me : well… we’re here for any business related i.t 
 issues with stores 
 so internet not working register issues printer issues etc 
 i apologize but losing personal items at the store has nothing to do with i.t 
 support associate : ok well 
 our printer is broken 
 me : what’s wrong with the printer 
 associate : i don’t know there’s like a jam or something 
 me : ok well i can help you with that 
 can you locate the jam 
 do you see paper or something 
 associate : i’m looking inside the printer and it looks like something is lodged up in <unk> 
 me : is there anyway you can try to fish it out 
 associate : yeah 
 i’m <unk> got it 
 oh hey it was my ipod 
 me : glad i can help 
 so in the past 5 years i 've been <unk> trying to get myself in the it industry 
 i went back to college full time in a great networking technologies program but then the wife at the time hung divorce over my head 
 dropped out of out college to work on relationship still ended up getting divorced 
 i felt like my chance at having a professional job in the it industry was gone 
 i used to day dream about having the chance of being that guy where the boss called you of a critical issue and needed you in asap 
 <unk> has always been a passion for me and i was dedicated to having a job where i wake up and look forward to work 
 fast forward 5 years 
 those day dreams became a reality 
 two months ago i was very <unk> to have landed a data center admin 
 position 
 even though i was not able to finish my degree in networking i was able to some how make the cut out of the <unk> applicants who probably had better credentials than myself 
 last weekend was when the day dreaming became real 
 i was at a friend 's house bbq'ing and it was around 8pm that night when i got the call 
 boss says hey <unk> is there anyway you can come to the data center 
 i know you 're bbq'ing but we 've had 3 servers go down since 3am 
 we 're not understanding what the network engineers in corporate are asking and we need your help '' 
 i immediately accept and head into the dc wearing <unk> and a <unk> along with 6 beers in the belly 
 i got on the phone conference and got the low down of the issue 
 in the 2 hours that i worked that evening i was able to resolve the issue and bring the servers back online that were down since 3am 
 i went back to the <unk> after that late night it encounter and finished my 12 pack of <unk> <unk> 
 turns out that my <unk> was on the conference call and i scored some hardcore <unk> points 
 the whole team thanked me up and down for helping them restore the servers on a short notice 
 i left the office that night with a massive smile and a feeling of <unk> 
 i got a little teary-eyed too because i was once told by the <unk> 's parents that i would never be successful in obtaining a professional it career 
 do n't ever let someone or an event prevent you from doing what you love doing 
 my fear after the divorce was that i would become a <unk> old man by not living a <unk> life and i refused to let that happen 
 tl dr <unk> wanted a divorce while in college for it career so i dropped out 
 wife still left and i still landed the it career i always wanted even though her parents stated that i would never obtain my dream <unk> just happened within the past week and i 'm still a little bit in disbelief 
 i 'm not going to <unk> this one as i think it 's ridiculousness speaks for itself 
 in this one there is only me $ user and the user 's boss $ manager 
 i get a ticket from the help desk for a manager requesting a replacement mouse for a specific employee $ user 
 the e-mail reads as follows : & gt $ manager : good morning we are need of a mouse for $ user in the xxxx department 
 thank you so much 
 to me that sounds like she just wants a new mouse not that there is an issue 
 however i do n't like to assume too much so i respond with : & gt shelbon : hi $ manager what is wrong with her current mouse 
 i figured she 'd respond with either that she wants a <unk> one or that it 's not working 
 at least that way i 'd have a better idea of what we 're talking about 
 & gt $ manger : $ user stated that it 's all over the place at times 
 now that 's still pretty vague but at least now i know it 's an actual technical issue 
 i replied to just let her know to have her employees call the help desk themselves in the future because i 've had problems with that since i started working here 
 $ user leaves at <unk> pm and i stay well past that usually so i waited for her to leave and went and tested the mouse but saw nothing wrong 
 i sat at her desk and moved the mouse around for about <unk> minutes just staring at the cursor move around 
 there was nothing wrong 
 i even checked the optical sensor on the bottom to see of a hair or something was stuck there but nope nothing 
 so i send her this e-mail : & gt shelbon : i went by your desk and i played around with the mouse but saw nothing wrong 
 sometimes small <unk> or hair can get into the optical sensor on the bottom and cause the issues you described 
 thinking that she would check again and see that the issue was not happening still and probably say something a long the lines of thanks ... or probably just never hear about it again 
 but i was wrong here is the e-mail i got from her : & gt $ user : i need the mouse replaced 
 you playing with it after i left yesterday does n't compare to using it for hours at a time 
 it sticks and <unk> my work flow down 
 this has been happening on and off for a while now but really caused me problems yesterday 
 i need to simply have it replaced or switched out 
 now if you 're thinking that e-mail sounds a little aggressive you 're not alone 
 in that response she also copied her bosses boss and the director of our office 
 they decided to inform her that her response was not professional and from what i could tell she would get a talking to 
 she then replies all which again includes upper management 
 & gt $ user : i was n't trying to be rude nor do i have an attitude 
 i was simply being direct about the situation 
 could you please replace my mouse so that i do n't keep experiencing these issues 
 <unk> 
 i just 
 wow 
 now i should mention that i was not bothered by her at any point during this i just find it hard to believe that she 's so ... bold ... in e-mails with upper management copied on them 
 so anyway i go over to her desk and ask her to show me what it 's doing but she could not replicate the issue 
 she gave me some more information though that made it seem like it 's not an issue with the mouse at all mostly because it seems to happen only in specific programs according to her 
 i ask her to just come get when it happens again so i can see the problem and explain that i 'll probably know what the issue is as soon as i see it occur 
 now you may be wondering why i did n't just replace the mouse first to see if that was the issue 
 normally i would but i have a few reasons 
 1. this person has been notorious for requesting replacement equipment in the past when it was n't necessary 
 2. i 'm trying to prove a point 
 3. i actually only have a few extra mice in stock so i do n't want a habit to start where end users thinking they can get replacement mice every time something happens with theirs 
 she seems to understand what i tell her and she agrees to come get me <unk> it happens again 
 that was first thing thursday morning 
 i do n't hear anything the rest of the day or on friday either 
 so about midday on monday i send her this e-mail : & gt shelbon : when we last spoke i requested you come get me if the issue with your mouse happens again 
 that was thursday morning and i still have not heard back from you which to me means the issue has not been <unk> 
 is that correct 
 her response : & gt $ user : no the issue is on going 
 it does it all day everyday when <unk> throughout $ software 
 i would be coming to you every single time i tried to do something different in $ software which is every few minutes 
 i have spoken with $ manger and she told me to go ahead email you or call every single time it does that but again that would literally be all day 
 at that rate i literally ca n't do my job 
 & gt shelbon : per our prior conversation i need to see it when it happens 
 that is where we left it 
 please come get me the next time it 's happening so i can see the issue 
 & gt $ user : you are welcome to come whenever you are available 
 as i said its ongoing 
 sigh 
 okay 
 so i walk over to her desk when i have a few free minutes and of course it 's not happening 
 i start to explain the same thing again but then it happened 
 i was able to see what she was talking about 
 basically she was using a program not supported by me or my company 
 it has it 's own vendor support that they 're supposed to call because it 's citrix based and we do n't have access to that citrix environment 
 the issue was that in one specific program with a very specific window open within it the cursor would shoot the bottom of the screen if it was moved above that window 
 but it only happens in that one program and only with that specific window open 
 clearly not a mouse issue and clearly not something i support 
 i show her what the issue by being able to reproduce the issue 
 i then explain that she needs to contact their support 
 she does n't seem to get it though so i just walk away document everything in the ticket and then close it 
 i also made a point of explaining to her that this is why i do n't just replace equipment without first verifying that it needs to be replaced to which she rolled her <unk> pristine office is the sign that you’ve <unk> all your work 
 at least that’s what my mother had told me when i was younger 
 as if in protest of that fact my office looked messy not dumping grounds messy but at least forgot to do the dishes messy 
 so it was with some surprise that i found myself facing an <unk> dressed woman in some distress 
 & gt pristine : my phone’s got a virus 
 <unk> head whipped around my office in a <unk> her eyes widened with her increasing gaze 
 she eventually reached into her handbag and produced a plastic lock bag 
 it contained a mobile phone 
 & gt me : i see ... & gt pristine : i’m very worried about it 
 i need my phone i’m expecting a very important call 
 pristine dropped the plastic bags onto my desk 
 she refused to take a seat looking down at it with suspicion 
 i bundled up the bag from the desk noting the triple layers of bag used 
 i opened the first bag 
 & gt pristine : what are you doing 
 & gt me : getting the phone 
 pristine eyes were wide her mouth scrambled words 
 & gt pristine : but the virus 
 it’ll spread 
 & gt me : i’m not entirely sure plastic protects against viruses 
 pulling the first bag free i wondered what error this lady was convinced was a virus 
 perhaps it was a general system message or an application was trying to install 
 either way i <unk> she <unk> contracted a real phone virus 
 not on a phone so old 
 i couldn’t wait to send this lady on her way and go back to avoiding cleaning 
 & gt pristine : but that’s what they do in hospitals 
 & gt me : ... i’m not sure hospitals deal with many phones 
 opening the second bag i pulled out the final third bag 
 one last piece of plastic between the phone and freedom 
 a strange substance seemed to be in the bag as well 
 it stuck to all the surfaces of the bag like a fine <unk> 
 pristine shrieked with shock when she saw it 
 & gt pristine : so as you can see my son <unk> all over my mobile 
 he’s quite sick 
 i dropped the bag down in <unk> 
 it <unk> to my desk with a <unk> 
 & gt me : clean your phone 
 grabbing a pencil i pushed the package back towards pristine who seemed to <unk> away from it 
 & gt pristine : do you have any special cleaning solution 
 & gt me : no just <unk> wipes 
 i’ll get you some if you like ... before i could launch myself away from the <unk> infection pristine had already produced two packets of wipes from her bag 
 she placed them on the table carefully 
 & gt pristine : the problem is ... look at the fine print ... i picked up one of the wipes and inspected the package carefully 
 it was just an average packet of wipes it had the usual warnings and information 
 & gt pristine : see it says it’ll get rid of <unk> % of <unk> 
 & gt me : ahh yes 
 & gt pristine : well my son is quite sick ... i just don’t want to take that <unk> % chance 
 if my head could have hit the desk it would have however the plastic bag containing the phone effectively <unk> my instincts 
 i pushed the wipes back towards pristine 
 & gt pristine : i rang the help line on the back 
 they couldn’t guarantee it would be effective they said i should speak to a professional 
 so ... here i am 
 & gt me : i think they meant ... medical professional 
 & gt pristine : like you said what would they know about phones 
 it was too much my head hit the desk 
 back when i was in high school i was <unk> involved with the technical side of <unk> 
 i did lights though i 've yet to make sense of the audio side 
 anyways halfway through <unk> of our production of *almost maine* great <unk> our <unk> tech <unk> director got word that some of the freqs we were using for wireless mics had been changed by the fcc a couple of weeks back 
 i happened to be in the audio booth when he broke the news 
 the conversation went as follows : td : technical director us : us & gt td : hey guys the fcc changed some stuff so we have to use other freqs for our mics 
 & gt us : cool what happened to the freqs we were using 
 & gt td : they 're being used for other things now 
 & gt us : such as ... 
 & gt td : <unk> missile control ... he handed us the printed email to show us that he was n't <unk> 
 turns out that for the couple of weeks we were unaware of the change we had been using for our wireless mics some of the same frequencies that were now being used for defense missile control 
 when the power went out in the school later that day we joked that perhaps we had launched a missile at a <unk> power plant 
 the funniest part is that as *almost maine* is set in well <unk> all of the crew had to dress for winter weather 
 watching our td come out to the audience in character to explain that the power and <unk> were out was hilarious 
 he was pretending to <unk> in a very thick coat on a very hot <unk> summer day 
 <unk> just had a guy come in the door with his desktop 
 six months '' he said 
 i have to come here every six months ... it was working fine i had no problems at all ... then suddenly last night ... it went back to the old internet 
 it went back to 7. the icons are all big everything is gone '' 
 i 've learned by now to not even try to make sense out of what people are saying about their computers 
 ok lem me check it out & amp i 'll call you '' 
 a few minutes ago i booted it up and it was a plain vanilla installation of windows 7. hmmm ... <unk> 's activated as well 
 let 's go exploring 
 i found a <unk> '' folder on his drive containing all his <unk> 
 did he ... <unk> he 
 omg ... did *i* 
 i press the eject button on the <unk> and out slides my copy of windows 7 not a bootleg mind you 
 so this dude sat through six months of <unk> any key to boot from cd ... for six months until that fateful moment last night when he hit that key 
 now i can understand accidentally pressing the wrong key but going through with a full reinstallation of the operating system is a bit more in depth than just an idle <unk> 
 at no point during this procedure did his brain ever register <unk> this does n't seem right maybe i should n't continue - nor did this hour & amp then some long process weigh enough on his mind to where he would mention it to me 
 yes i left the cd in the drive 
 oops 
 previous witchcraft that was the *only* possible reason i was smiling as i walked into the office on a monday morning 
 the brightness of my mood matched perfectly with the charming new brew in my hand 
 & gt redcheer : airz 
 i turned to catch a look of excitement on redcheers face 
 & gt me : redcheer i forgot its your first day here isn’t it 
 i hadn’t forgotten 
 & gt redcheer : yep 
 & gt me : i’ll lead the way let me introduce you to the <unk> as i walked into the office i caught a glimpse of my reflection a new emotion was registering on my face was this 
 happiness 
 & gt me : okay everyone 
 this is redcheer she’s our new tech 
 most of the office turned around the monday morning frowns of some of our most hardened techs soon turning upside down at the sight of redcheer 
 & gt colourblind : urh… hi i’m colourblind 
 colourblind 's <unk> introduction aside most of the techs seemed relaxed about the whole affair except pant suit who was staring daggers 
 redcheer surveyed the room utterly ignoring the increasingly nervous <unk> 
 & gt redcheer : oh my 
 is that you… pant suit 
 <unk> complete <unk> went unnoticed by the rest of the room as redcheer excitedly walked over to pantsuit 
 & gt redcheer : it’s me redcheer remember 
 & gt pantsuit : i remember a senior year party 
 distinctly 
 colourblind was still standing almost motionless in a mid introduction pose 
 poor guy seemed broken 
 & gt redcheer : that was at your house 
 i remember everyone said it was an amazing party 
 i don’t really remember it 
 & gt pantsuit : oh course you don’t 
 i was <unk> for months for that party after you threw up in the pool 
 clogged the thing ... my parents were livid 
 colourblind started to blink again 
 i was honestly relieved he was still alive too much paperwork otherwise 
 & gt redcheer : sorry about that 
 it was years ago though 
 & gt pantsuit : i missed <unk> because of you 
 all because you can’t hold a bit of liquor 
 colourblind looked wreaked his eyes looked like they were trying to work out what had **just** happened 
 i was tempted to go pat him on the back decided against it 
 & gt redcheer : i think my drink was <unk> 
 sorry though 
 & gt pantsuit : don’t blame it on spiking 
 just admit you can’t handle your drink 
 colourblind suddenly snapped back to reality 
 he started walking over to his desk 
 & gt colourblind : drink 
 yes 
 don’t mind if i do 
 he pulled out a large bottle of vodka 
 pantsuit walked over to colourblind’s desk and grabbed the bottle 
 & gt pantsuit : i’ll drink you under the table right now 
 & gt redcheer : ha you’d need way more than that before i’d <unk> over 
 at this point itsec pulled out a bottle of the cheapest <unk> high strength alcohol 
 it was at this point i snapped out of my <unk> 
 & gt me : woah woah 
 what are you doing 
 its 9am monday morning 
 the office collectively looked at what they were doing 
 people started looking at their feet like a child scolded 
 itsec looked particularly <unk> as if i’d killed his life dream 
 & gt me : itsec why do you have this 
 i held up the bottle of… terrible liquid 
 itsec shrugged 
 & gt itsec : just in <unk> 
 & gt me : just in case what 
 when would you ever want to <unk> this 
 itsec looked appropriately apologetic for bringing in such <unk> bad liquor 
 i decided to let him off this time 
 an awkward pause settled over the whole office 
 & gt redcheer : ahm yes 
 so.. i’m redcheer 
 looking forward to working with you all 
 & gt pantsuit : oh airz i think i <unk> train her 
 i looked between the two women 
 pantsuit was still clutching a massive bottle of vodka in her hand <unk> 
 & gt me : er no 
 it’s okay 
 the other techs in the office then started offering to teach redcheer as if only then remembering that the position was still open 
 redcheer started turning them down herself 
 i took a sip of coffee as i realized everything was going to be okay & gt pantsuit : airz is right drinking now is silly 
 good thing the company xmas party is this week 
 lets see if you can hold your drink then 
 pantsuit looked <unk> at redcheer who turned and smiled 
 & gt redcheer : looking forward to it 
 or not ... next i support a software made for writing <unk> estimates and as such i 'm used to the average software user being more comfortable under the hood than behind the keyboard 
 but sometimes there is that one shining example of a user who understands just enough to be angry 
 **caller** : i ca n't believe you have to give me permission to uninstall your program on my own computer 
 <unk> : i 'm sorry 
 **caller** : your program is telling me i do n't have permission 
 i want it uninstalled and gone 
 i do n't know why i have to call you guys to get permission 
 so i get remoted in and he has on screen what i suspected : he 's trying to uninstall on a <unk> account 
 i have them switch to a different windows account and try again 
 uninstalled like it was nothing 
 **caller** : i want you to make sure it 's gone 
 every bit of it 
 i do n't want any part on here 
 so i locate the folders that stay behind after an uninstall and <unk> them 
 there 's <unk> a trace of it remaining 
 **caller** : okay and if i want to reinstall later where will my files be that i move back in 
 <unk> : i 'm afraid those were just deleted 
 is there anything else i can help you with today 
 *cue ranting that makes me glad we 're separated by a phone 
 * it 's the summer of <unk> i 'm working at an ad agency i 'm working on my <unk> car and hanging out with my roommate and girlfriend 
 a middle aged woman who happens to be my neighbor walks over to me after talking to my roommate 
 i say hello while adjusting an <unk> belt 
 she launches into her issue without <unk> : nice older lady : '' roommate says you 're in computers 
 know anything about email '' 
 me : '' i work with computers when i 'm not trying to <unk> with old cars 
 i know a thing or two about email '' nice older lady : '' i ca n't read email from my daughter '' me : '' i do n't understand 
 if she sends you something you get it and it 's scrambled 
 or it 's blank '' 
 nice older lady getting frustrated : '' no 
 i ca n't read email that my daughter sends '' me : '' what email provider does she use '' 
 this was still when people used aol 
 i was guessing that there was some strange formatting issue 
 nice older lady : '' i do n't know anything about computers '' nice older lady even more frustrated : '' she 's not sending it to me she 's sending it to some man '' me : '' i see 
 that 's kind of the way it works 
 if you 're not the intended audience ... '' not so nice older lady : '' but she 's involved with a married man 
 i want to see if she 's sleeping with him '' me : '' have you thought of asking her 
 you know like a <unk> conversation over tea '' 
 no longer nice older lady : '' i figured if you knew computer you 'd be able to mimics typing just get in and read it '' me : '' so you want me to figure out her email address break into the email server and find out if your daughter is having an affair with a married man '' smiling older lady : '' yes '' 
 me : '' so you want me to commit a <unk> to solve a family problem best handled with a conversation '' older lady : '' i figured it would be easy for you '' mimics typing again 
 me : '' sorry '' 
 background : i do inbound technical support for a certain fortune 500 company that manufactures and sells phones tablets computers and software 
 one day i get a call from a customer who 's having issues accessing her account 
 & gt ot me : thanks for contacting fortune 500 company my name is oz_town how may i help you today 
 & gt user : my name is user i 'm having some issues with my account it 's not letting me sign in and it 's very annoying 
 *oh good an easy <unk> & gt ot : i can understand that can be frustrating can i grab the email address you use as your account id so i can pull it up in the system 
 & gt user : sure it 's <unk> email address 
 *at this point it 's a bit difficult to hear as i 'm unfortunately sitting next to the loudest <unk> in the building who practically screams into his <unk> and the line quality is n't the <unk> & gt ot : sorry user what was that one again 
 the line is a bit rough 
 if you could spell it for me that would be great 
 & gt user : oh sure it 's almost as <unk> as last time 
 <unk> this stage most people get the hint to spell their email address phonetically but not this user 
 * & gt ot : i 'm really sorry user i just was n't able to hear that too well at all 
 would you be able to spell it phonetically using the phonetic alphabet 
 not sure how much more specific i can get here *at this point i 'm leaning back in my chair waiting for a u '' for uniform '' or t '' for <unk> '' 
 instead i hear this ungodly screeching come down the line and blast through my headset ... * & gt user : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> & gt ot : ... i ... what ... & gt user : <unk> <unk> <unk> *i had no idea what was happening and sat there in disbelief until the user had stopped <unk> her email address phonetically '' 
 * & gt ot : um ... <unk> that an email 
 & gt user : yes i spelled it phonetically just as you asked did you get it 
 & gt ot : phonetically as in a '' for alpha '' b '' for bravo '' or c '' for charlie '' 
 & gt user : realising she has just fucked up in the most embarrassing way possible oh ... tl dr the user had confused <unk> for syllables and was spelling her email address the way a 1st grade student would be asked to pronounce charlie '' e.g 
 <unk> previous as i stared down at a lady with striped glasses and no name i considered my options 
 she was asking for a computer <unk> to the head of accounting should i just… give it to her 
 seemed easier then arguing 
 screw it arguing is sometimes more fun 
 & gt me : lets start with who you are and what you’re doing here 
 & gt stripes : my name isn’t important and i’m here for that computer 
 & gt me : you know i’m not in the habit of just handing out computers to anyone 
 stripes gave me an exasperated look 
 she <unk> and went looking in her bag 
 after minutes of searching she finally pulled out some identification cards 
 & gt stripes : see i work here 
 now give me that computer 
 now 
 i looked down at her identification card 
 it basically said her name and a <unk> with a company logo 
 & gt me : yes 
 so you’ve got a card what do you want the computer for though 
 stripes was looking more and more agitated i had calmed down and hoping to play the long delay game 
 & gt stripes : i just need it 
 so which one is it 
 stripes was looking around the department as if expecting to just be able to pick it up 
 & gt me : none of these are the one you want what do you need it for again 
 & gt stripes : you’re awfully nosey 
 just get go and get it 
 it was at this point i wished i had a coffee so i could take a long sip and savor the sweet moment in front of me 
 & gt me : umm lets see… 
 nope 
 all out of free computers for random office workers today 
 & gt stripes : go get it 
 the anger on stripes face was starting to boil over 
 & gt me : not until you tell me why you need it 
 & gt stripes : its not your job to know why people need something 
 its your job to make sure it works when people get it 
 now go and get the computer 
 stripes was screaming at this point 
 the entire it staff was now watching a lady explode 
 i couldn’t help the smirk forming on my face 
 & gt me : no 
 i’m afraid you’re going to have to leave 
 now 
 stripes looked around the room and realized everyone was watching her 
 & gt stripes : urh… sorry 
 sorry everyone 
 i’m just a little stressed 
 could ummm someone go get me the head of accounts computer quickly for me 
 she smiled at the department colourblind saw the smile and jumped up 
 & gt colourblind : everyone has a bad day once in a while 
 colourblind smiled nicely back at stripes his earlier <unk> <unk> away 
 & gt stripes : yeah just so much stress and well… no need to <unk> you with it… still it would be nice if you could just get up and grab that computer for me 
 colourblind as if dazed by a lady actually talking to him mumbled <unk> and turned to face where the pc was lying 
 & gt me : don’t 
 move 
 colourblind looked at me dazed as if only then realizing what was happening 
 he had paused with one foot mid air 
 & gt me : what do you need the computer for stripes 
 stripes looked over at colourblind who was frozen mid step 
 she screamed 
 & gt stripes : <unk> 
 fine 
 stripes then stormed out of the department in a massive huff 
 i had half a mind to go after her and work out to which department she belonged 
 instead i turned to colourblind 
 & gt me : colourblind you <unk> sit 
 colourblind took his seat however when he sat down he stared at the ground with his head in his hands 
 again 
 next tuesday <unk> switcher was a complicated employee he’d been flung between different departments often 
 no manager seemed to be able to keep him as he kept requesting to be <unk> 
 this caused him to be a semi regular down in it sorting out which account of his needed to be activated 
 & gt switcher : hey i need my password reset 
 its not working 
 & gt me : again 
 i’d started to become suspicious of <unk> ability to remember any passwords 
 normally i’d try to hammer the issue home but we had to deal with switcher so often he felt oddly like family 
 & gt switcher : i dunno what keeps happening 
 & gt me : okay i’ll reset it just try to make an easy to remember password this time 
 normally i wouldn’t give out such terrible advice but having reset his password everyday for a week i was growing tired of our daily interactions 
 & gt switcher : i always make my password the same i dunno whats happening 
 & gt me : i’ll pretend i didn’t hear that 
 my laziness on password security had been worn down 
 i sent off the reset and quickly hung up the phone 
 hating myself for having my standards <unk> so much 
 ***** tuesday 8pm it was a long day most of which i spent <unk> it’s poor security standards 
 i <unk> to myself that i’d hammer the next breach in security i saw if only to feel better about letting the last one go 
 the phone rang 
 & gt me : hello 
 & gt 
 : hello err my account isn’t accepting my password 
 & gt me : you’ll need a password reset 
 perfect my mind thought as i prepared myself for the it security lecture of a lifetime 
 i just waited for the inevitable “i always use the same password” or “why doesn’t <unk> work as a password” 
 & gt me : whats your name 
 & gt 
 : switcher 
 & gt me : you’re up late ... wait this doesn’t sound like switcher 
 an <unk> 
 oh i could really scream at someone like that 
 i opened the <unk> of insults in my head 
 & gt 
 : you don’t sound like the normal it guy 
 some of the night it guys had started to arrive at work upon seeing my office light on they entered 
 & gt nightowl : oh airz 
 do i hear switcher on the phone 
 i’ve been meaning to email you about that 
 i’ve changed his password every day for a week 
 something is wrong with his account 
 i mouthed “this isn’t the real <unk> at nightowl 
 & gt nightowl : yes its is 
 all us night guys hang out 
 i’ve known the guy for years 
 & gt me : wait what ... ***** it was the next day that the truth finally <unk> 
 <unk> and <unk> had the same name 
 unfortunately when the switcher i knew who kept <unk> between departments got put into his current team another employee already had an identical account name 
 instead of creating a new account i had assumed the active account of the server as actually his 
 it was not 
 i 'd been giving an account to someone who did n't own it 
 : i work as a customer facing programmer 
 most of my communication with customers is through email 
 when the phone rings that usually means someone either did n't see my email or something fairly complicated is going on 
 the phone rang today 
 i recognized the number 
 i <unk> under my breath 
 & gt me : <unk> $ this is wishful '' 
 & gt customer : hey wishful 
 this is <unk> $ 
 yeah i 'm still having that issue with the custom project you sent me 
 it still pops up that message when i tried to send an email '' 
 & gt me : i sent you an email on the 8th with an updated file 
 did you install that '' 
 & gt customer : yeah ... i saw that 
 i did n't read it 
 there were too many words and i get <unk> when i see that '' 
 & gt me : ... okay 
 i 'll take over '' 
 at least he was honest 
 i was working in a call center tech support for one of those extended warranties and we got a really odd call 
 seems that this lady had put her sub sandwich on top of her computer which warmed it up and the sandwich went bad 
 this customer called up demanding a replacement 
 of course a computer warranty would never cover something like this so naturally we resisted 
 the issue escalated <unk> 
 it turns out however the store that sold her the computer also sold <unk> and the warranty paperwork they gave her was for such an appliance and did cover food <unk> 
 we did end up replacing her lunch but she wo n't be getting any help with her computer 
 so she spent over $ 100 to get a $ 5 sandwich replaced 
 td dr : it does n't pay to be nasty edit : just to clarify a few points based on the discussion the $ 100 was my estimate for the cost of the warranty 
 the store in question did have separate warranties for the appliances and computers the computer warranty was very specific as to what <unk> not covered first of all mods i want to give you my most <unk> apologies for yesterday 's post i was in a rant for what happened i 'm terribly sorry 
 it was a normal day for the most part at the store easter holidays so i 'm working full-time to earn a bit more cash we were attending people as usual when a guy in his late 20s came in and ask us to check why his laptop would n't turn on i had to handle it since my co-worker was busy 
 he places it on the counter and i take a look at it check the battery first and remove it to make sure the connectors and battery are not damaged nothing unusual 
 i open the lid and i felt a weird smell like cleaning products the keyboard and screen look somewhat dirt like if they had spilled soda all over it and cleaned it with some products 
 & gt $ me : excuse me sir have you by any chance spilled liquid on it or have you used any cleaning products 
 & gt $ guy : uh huh i clean it often 
 but not so well it seems i do the normal tests it would n't turn on i used my charger to give it power i have the same model and as i try to operate it the keys feel a bit sticky like ... <unk> the <unk> <unk> i pay closer attention to the dirt spots they look like glue and the screen has drip marks ... just like if someone ... i realize why it was dirty and i completely lost it 
 insults and more came out of me my boss came in to see why i was yelling like that i show him my horrible discover after some nasty words exchange the guy leaves with his laptop i head to the restroom spending little over 10 minutes washing my hands and arms and my co-worker cleaning the counter 
 we closed the store as usual and i head home my boss was kind enough to allow me come in a bit late and <unk> few years back i worked the it helpdesk for a large energy firm in the uk one of the big six '' 
 all support calls were internal to the company and its <unk> 
 i <unk> in support of one of the <unk> often taking over calls from colleagues with limited experience in the <unk> 's systems 
 i would also take calls to translate all english but <unk> 
 -- -- -- -- -- i would often rush the call to get a gas engineer back on the road with a working laptop 
 most fixes involved pushing a fix file to their system or a reboot 
 this particular day had been brutal i had just come off of a 30 minute call between our indian 3rd line team and an <unk> field engineer 
 the next call was from a <unk> engineer ge ge : my laptop is <unk> me : what seems to be the problem ge : i do n't <unk> know i do n't know computers me : not a problem i do n't know how to change out a gas meter 
 so what 's happening with the machine 
 ge : well i called up earlier and the guy sent a fix which i did but it did n't fix it 
 so i called back and he said i needed to switch it off then wait five minutes before booting it 
 me : okay that sounds right is the error still there 
 ge : no but i 've now got this <unk> web on my screen 
 me : that sounds strange can you walk me through what you did 
 ge : well i ran the fix did n't work then i turned it off and put it on the seat while i had a tea then i put it on the floor ... i knew where this was headed i <unk> in expectation ge : then i booted it me : with your foot 
 ge : aye it 's booted 
 i sent him back to the depot 60 mile round trip for a new machine 
 **tl dr** engineer was told to boot his machine kicked it previous taking a new computer to each techs desk myself was great 
 everyone was happy to receive an upgrade and continuously thanked me which in turn made me happy 
 <unk> solitaire stood i arrived with his new mac 
 the frown on his face was small but growing 
 & gt solitaire : i like my current setup 
 & gt me : no worries you can have two computers 
 solitaire eyed the mac 
 he didn’t look keen 
 & gt solitaire : no… no i don’t want **that** near my stuff 
 & gt me : er okay… 
 well it’s your choice 
 as i turned to deliver the computer to someone else solitaire spoke again 
 & gt solitaire : so… <unk> my upgrade for this coming 
 i turned a second time and saw him <unk> on his desktop 
 & gt me : this… mac is the upgrade for that pc 
 & gt solitaire : i’ve been looking online and i think <unk> would be more my style 
 he gestured over at his screen which was showing a bunch of parts in a cart along with a gaming case 
 & gt me : that looks like a nice computer 
 & gt solitaire : cool can i order it 
 i tried to give solitaire my best “really” face 
 & gt me : no 
 & gt solitaire : but i could get work done quicker if this computer was faster though 
 at this point in time i was still holding a brand new mac in my hands which i’d attempted to give him 
 & gt me : you can have this mac 
 or keep your current setup 
 or both but you can’t get an entirely **new** pc 
 <unk> face looked crushed 
 he wasn’t very happy 
 i held the mac out expecting him to give in 
 & gt solitaire : no 
 i don’t want it 
 <unk> i thought 
 after giving out all the computers i had one spare 
 i put it in my office 
 better get rid of the spare mac fast before solitaire changes his mind but who needs a new computer… 
 ***** i sat down to consult my coffee over who needed a new computer in the company 
 “a nice mac like that could buy you lots of <unk> my coffee whispered 
 i took a sip of the delicious golden brown liquid 
 & gt me : yes yes it <unk> but how to get it there 
 ***** i knocked at the door of the boss of my chosen recipient for the new mac 
 come <unk> the voice said from within the room & gt me : hello vp 
 just wondering if <unk> like an upgrade for your computer 
 i had brought the mac in question up with me 
 the vp eyed it and me suspiciously 
 & gt vp : upgrade 
 & gt me : yep we’ve a spare computer lying about and i thought… who could use a mac os and needs an upgrade 
 the vp looked between me and the computer as if <unk> something wrong 
 & gt vp : so 
 that’s **just** a new computer 
 & gt me : yep 
 we can hook it up to a screen and you’re away 
 vp’s eyes looked calculating 
 & gt vp : whats wrong with my current computer 
 & gt me : well its a little old 
 this one will be much faster 
 i smiled but the vp was busy admiring the mac 
 & gt vp : looks like a nice computer but… i don’t want it & gt me : you don’t 
 & gt vp : no i don’t trust er… 
 it 
 i shrugged my shoulders and turned to walk out the door 
 & gt vp : wait… thats it 
 no arguing 
 & gt me : if you don’t want an upgrade you don’t want an upgrade 
 now i’ve got to find someone else who could use a faster computer 
 any ideas 
 the vp looked like he was in conflict with himself 
 i crossed my fingers and hoped this would work 
 & gt vp : but.. er.. <unk> give it to my secretary 
 <unk> 
 i smiled internally 
 the vp was sometimes *too* easy 
 & gt me : okay 
 ***** & gt me : hey vpsec 
 & gt vpsec : airz 
 how’s it going 
 i shrugged my shoulders and smiled 
 & gt me : not bad not bad 
 just wondering if you’d like this 
 i held up the new computer 
 & gt vpsec : er… thats quite a nice computer but are you sure that isn’t for the vp 
 & gt me : no no 
 my it’s my gift to you 
 vpsec smiled broadly 
 & gt vpsec : wow this is quite the upgrade 
 & gt me : consider it <unk> 
 next this happened 5 minutes ago : & gt me : <unk> this is <unk> how can i help you 
 & gt medrec : yes this is medrec 
 we are missing our <unk> file from august 2nd and august 36th 
 & gt me : uh you mean august 2nd and august 3rd 
 & gt medrec : no august 2nd and august 36th 
 & gt me : ... & gt medrec : can you recover them for me 
 & gt me : no 
 i ca n't pull any data from beyond this date 
 and the august 3rd file has n't been <unk> yet 
 & gt medrec : no no no no you are n't listening 
 i need august 2nd and august 36th 
 & gt me : ma'am open your calendar 
 & gt medrec : okay 
 & gt me : point to august 36th 
 & gt medrec : oh 
 my 
 god 
 & gt me : yeah you meant august 1st and august 2nd did n't you 
 & gt medrec : it 's been a long weekend 
 absolutely 
 edit : i said ma'am and fixed it above 
 as well as i.t 
 - i was battling a <unk> infection during the writing of this and would type between <unk> 
 also thanks guys for putting <unk> <unk> in my head 
 - 5 years ago i was hired at my current position to help bring the financial institution into the 21st century 
 my first step was getting them a mobile platform 
 check 
 my second was to take them from paper loan files to paperless 
 i implemented the product one year after being hired and to this day people still do n't use it correctly 
 they use the old way and then scan the paper into the system 
 which is the hardest way because you can send everything directly into the system without ever printing a piece of paper 
 but you know people have to hold their paper 
 i have given each of the loan officers single page scanners for items that our members bring in but they use those single page scanners to scan whole entire loan documents 
 so for the last 4 years the loan officers have been complaining about how slow the paperless process is and how much faster the older process is 
 my response has always been do it correctly and it will be faster 
 i have showed them and showed them and showed them how to do it without printing and scanning 
 and they have all responded for the last 4 years that their way is quicker and that i am not a loan officer so i do n't understand 
 and i ca n't tell them how to do their job 
 so comes today 
 i made a deal with them 
 i would take on their fastest loan officer and that person could do it their way and i would take a loan and do it my way 
 if i finished first they have to learn the way i want them to do it 
 if their loan officer finishes first i will never again bring it up and i will get each branch a big <unk> scanner 
 they picked the person who complains the most 
 the person who gives me the hardest time about how fast she is with the old way and how my scanning paperless is causing more headaches than it is worth 
 we sat down and they started the clock 
 i am sure they thought that with me not actually being a loan officer i did n't have the experience 
 the goal was to get everything into the system and the person who got it done first would win 
 it started out as a small competition 
 everyone was watching 
 she got off to a fast start because she knows the boxes 
 she can type without even reading what is coming up 
 i was still busy typing in the data into the system as she started to print 
 i was just finishing up entry of the information when she started to scan 
 i hit my button to send everything over into the system and there was stunned silence when i said <unk> and she was in the process of scanning 35 pages still 
 they did n't believe me at first 
 they all said i probably did n't do it correctly because she was way ahead of me in the process 
 i showed them my completed loan in the system and they all went over it with a <unk> <unk> looking for a mistake 
 telling her to keep going that if i made a mistake she could still win 
 i had made no mistake 
 i just did n't have to spend 10 minutes scanning single pages of stuff just to scan it 
 they can now all <unk> and learn the system like i have been begging them to do for 4 years because i beat their best and i do n't even know their <unk> staff meetings always seemed so <unk> 
 except around budget time when money was discussed everyone paid attention 
 & gt accounting manager : so airz it says here on your budget allocation form that the amount you want is <unk> then last <unk> 
 & gt me : that sounds about right 
 a few of the managers gave incredulous looks to each other 
 & gt accounting manager : usually departments give a specific figure ... & gt me : oh we’re doing that again this year 
 every year i calculate how much it needs and every year i end up with exactly the same amount regardless of what i calculate 
 i thought maybe it was some weird <unk> 
 the incredulous looks now shifted to ones of wide eyed shock 
 & gt accounting manager : i assure you we look at the numbers we are given very carefully 
 & gt me : do you 
 i mean last year we had a plan to upgrade every department to a new operating system 
 our budget came back with zero extra funds 
 & gt accounting manager : clearly you’re upset about this but unfortunately we do not have unlimited funds 
 now can you please just give me the specific number that you’re requesting 
 i took a pen out of my pocket and wrote out the number that i was normally allocated 
 i added a few zeros for good measure 
 i folded this piece of paper in half and <unk> to discreetly slide it over the table towards the accounting manager 
 the accounting manager unfolded the piece of paper and almost <unk> 
 & gt accounting manager : outrageous 
 airz please submit something a little more reasonable 
 i took back the scrap of paper and wrote down the same amount i received every year 
 then added a single dollar 
 the accounting manager smiled 
 & gt accounting manager : now this is a number i can work with ... i sat back in my chair knowing the meeting was now over for me 
 i didn’t even bother requesting additional funds to upgrade our crumbling equipment 
 unlike every other department i’d completely lost faith in the allocation system after last year 
 seeing the sales department get funding for its third <unk> room <unk> in four years was the nail in the coffin for me 
 **** i arrived back in my office with an email already waiting for me 
 after carefully looking at your records the budget allocation for it this year will be ... i looked at the figure 
 it was the same amount i received every year they didn’t even add the dollar 
 <unk> i decided to type up an email 
 company wide 
 <unk> to lack of funds it can no longer support any company <unk> this bill will now need to be covered by individual departments 
 this change will come into effect ... .** the email was rather boring and very formal 
 it outlined why and how the responsibility changed from the it budget to the <unk> of individual departments 
 it was fun to write 
 within seconds my office phone began to ring 
 & gt accounting manager : airz whats is this i read about shifting costs on to the departments for company phones 
 this wasn’t in any of your budget reports 
 & gt me : oh i know 
 it was in last year’s costings 
 when i requested more funds to keep paying the contracts 
 last year you sent an email that said we’d get the funds this year 
 we did not 
 i assumed that meant you wanted us to shift those cost <unk> 
 & gt accounting manager : but 
 what 
 why can’t we just leave it how we’ve always done it 
 you’ve the same amount of money 
 i <unk> to ponder this for a second 
 & gt me : i can’t 
 my costings this year didn’t include the company <unk> and my costings have already been approved by your department after <unk> <unk> 
 the accounting manager sounded stumped on the phone i could hear him clearly <unk> through the forms trying to find any evidence that i was mistaken 
 & gt accounting manager : this is just a small oversight ... you should still pay the company phones as normal 
 & gt me : oversight 
 couldn’t be 
 didn’t you say you carefully went through **all** the numbers 
 & gt accounting manager : if the vp was here ... & gt me : but he isn’t 
 so you’ve a choice either *i* get extra funding to pay for all these phones or <unk> is going to have to hand in new expenses reports 
 he hung up 
 after much deliberation i got the extra funds 
 apparently admitting they didn’t actually check my budget forms was too much 
 instead they bought me off 
 i was happy 
 coincidentally this all happened the same week it found the funds to upgrade its own break room 
 new coffee machine and all 
 this one 's pretty long 
 if it starts to feel like a bit of a <unk> dog story i apologize ... but it felt that way to me too 
 and it starts the way many stories in here do : **i acquired a new client recently 
 ** they were n't <unk> with their current it vendor the company was growing they wanted to check out their options etc 
 a common enough story 
 i asked them about their specific needs and problems and they told me about backup paranoia the server getting overloaded '' and crappy email service 
 natch 
 so i did a site survey 
 <unk> the old <unk> bingo <unk> '' scenario i see 
 ** the server was a windows 2012r2 host running a single windows 2012r2 guest under <unk> - no <unk> no image based backup no replication 
 so it 's a bare metal server but the old it vendor just ran it virtualized so it is n't technically a bare metal server and they did n't look like a scrub 
 as far as they knew 
 gotcha 
 <unk> backup paranoia was definitely <unk> 
 ** there was an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> plugged into the back of the server by way of usb and a scheduled task in the vm set to run windows backup once daily 
 it had n't produced an actual backup in over 9 months 
 there is n't really much more to say about that 
 just drink 
 **the ad interface was visibly slow and the isp was hosting their email 
 ** just opening windows on the server 's desktop was <unk> so that explained the overloaded '' thing - trying to run <unk> guests on a couple of <unk> <unk> disks is n't likely to impress anybody for performance 
 and they were running <unk> email so yep that 's gon na suck all right 
 so i ask one more question - are you concerned about <unk> backup 
 yes they say absolutely that 's mandatory going forward 
 ok site survey is done i 've got this 
 **at no point did <unk> say *anything* about a printer 
 remember that please it 's important 
 ** anyway i write up a proposal and come back onsite to talk to them about it 
 office365 for the email problem solved there 
 i told them about sanoid and how it could solve their remote backup problem as well as their performance issues and they were on board <unk> on me doing a good job with their office365 <unk> 
 their <unk> migration goes swimmingly so now we 're golden to proceed 
 **i give them a <unk> and they <unk> shoot for best '' 
 ** sweet i get to set this up right 
 so three new sanoid boxes with fully solid state storage 
 we 're going to have a production vm host an onsite <unk> <unk> host and an offsite <unk> dr host 
 <unk> hours to migrate all their apps and data from the old hardware to the new do any <unk> etc 
 <unk> week or so later i bring in the new hardware and start setting things up 
 ** new domain controller guest on production 
 new <unk> guest on production 
 hourly replication to the <unk> 
 daily replication to the offsite 
 <unk> all of their data from the old server to the new one get rid of the shitty batch file in <unk> that was <unk> mapping their drives and frequently <unk> with memory card readers lenovo recovery <unk> and god knows what else 
 replace it with some proper <unk> to map their drives consistently 
 install their industry niche apps punch holes in the windows firewall that those apps installers either failed to punch or failed to punch <unk> looking at you <unk> get it all in one <unk> ok 
 tested ran through workstation setups fixed a few local issues on workstations problems as they were flushed got a *new* industry niche app installed and i 'm almost ready to call it a day - everything 's up users are happy new servers are smoking fast and <unk> happy comments from the users and owners life is good 
 <unk> an <unk> cry from down the hall : dammit the printer *still* does n't work 
 ** so i head on down to the print room where a canon ir copier and a user both stare <unk> at me 
 the user <unk> scanning a document to the network which should work just fine - the user who is quite technically competent had already updated the address book to point to the new vm - and in fact it <unk> work just fine 
 the user frustrated says well of <unk> it works with you standing here '' 
 i grab a piece of paper out of the tray <unk> a <unk> <unk> on both sides and scan again 
 it works again - but it 's a bit <unk> <unk> and slow 
 the user 's frustration increases but i 'm pretty sure i know what 's up now 
 i scan my <unk> <unk> again and this time i get a complete failure to connect to the server and the user says see 
 ... but the new server was supposed to *fix* this '' 
 * wait what 
 * ok what is this thing 's ip address '' 
 *that* one <unk> the user so i do my best <unk> burns your company 's computer guy <unk> gently shoulder her aside and rummage through the canon 's <unk> local interface for myself 
 i knew *exactly* what i was going to find 
 **the copier tech <unk> the copier to get an ip address then immediately <unk> it to the address <unk> 'd gotten by dhcp 
 ** the damn copier techs *always* do this 
 and it works fine until after the copier tech has left the scene of the crime - but then the dhcp lease expires and the router marks that address available again 
 now the next time some *other* device 's lease expires while it 's powered off the router hands it the address the <unk> is <unk> on when it powers back on and requests a new one 
 now you have a copier that randomly works and does n't work and a random device elsewhere in the office that *also* randomly works and does n't work 
 sure enough the client 's dhcp range starts at <unk> and the damn copier is <unk> to <unk> so i run to a workstation ping .99 arp .99 confirm that nothing 's on .99 and run back and <unk> the copier to .99 and of course it all works every time and without weird <unk> or slowness either 
 go <unk> it hero <unk> of the print room and whatever poor random user keeps drawing the loaded <unk> in the daily game of dhcp roulette too 
 **the final task left that day is setting up a new workstation for the same user who flushed the copier problem 
 ** that went without incident and she was super happy about her new <unk> machine so yay 
 after that was done before heading out for the day i spend a few minutes talking to her and to the internal <unk> it <unk> who is my main point of contact for the company ... and they let drop that the entire reason i was brought in which i had never heard of until that day was *the mysteriously and randomly <unk> <unk> 
 the copier vendor had told them their network was overloaded '' their old it vendor pointed fingers back at the copier people but could n't actually figure out what the problem was so i got brought in to replace the old it vendor and here we were 
 i was stunned 
 <unk> literally just spent 17 grand to change an ip address 
 ** do n't get me wrong obviously they got a *hell* of a lot more out of the deal than that but *the ip <unk> was what they actually wanted fixed in the first place 
 i hesitantly pointed that out to them but happily they had no <unk> 
 nah - your name is going to be <unk> here for the next few months at least 'cause *the copier actually <unk> '' 
 ** '' besides all that other stuff really needed doing anyway 
 ** and it did - it really really did i could talk for hours about how much better off they are now - but <unk> 
 *this dear reddit is is a story of justice 
 a tale of evil clients and <unk> in shining qa departments 
 & amp nbsp **the setting : ** our company runs a set of databases with a light website for managing reports on data all of which is used as a customer management system for a large number of large clients that want to host websites but do n't want to manage a database to sit behind it 
 **the heroes : ** i work as a lowly qa tech in a qa department of about 8. i 've been working in this place for about 5 years now and i 'm frequently asked to sit in on calls with clients 
 they trust me enough now to leave me to get on with things and communicate with the client directly if there 's anything i want to ask about 
 my boss is a certified <unk> with a degree from the college of how to earn respect 
 the guy lets me get on with my work and takes care of all the business side and <unk> politics 
 great boss 
 my good friend who we 'll call greg works as a fairly senior member of the customer support department 
 greg 's got my back and i 've got his 
 if he has something come through that he needs help with or looks serious then i 'll help him out 
 **the <unk> : ** the client 's project manager who we 'll <unk> call ... douche was tasked with being the gateway for all communication with us and was either extremely vague or <unk> incompetent whenever he discussed the requirements for what would be delivered 
 when paired together these things often mean that bad things will happen 
 to make things worse this guy was intentionally insulting because he could get away with it 
 after all he is a paying customer 
 **the <unk> : ** the client paid us for a piece of work where we made a custom api which we expose on our soap interface 
 it was a good feature and one which our sales representatives had probably been told to try and get a client to fund for quite some time 
 implementing it was a nightmare because they had added some complex functionality in their requirements document just before they signed it off 
 all my best attempts to try to resolve <unk> and make it work <unk> fell on deaf ears and eyes that refuse to read emails 
 one exchange with douche on this topic went thus : & gt *me : * hi douche its derp at & lt company & gt 
 just calling <unk> ... & gt *douche : * oh hi yeah the slacker at & lt company & gt 
 hows it going 
 it should be pointed out that we were slightly behind schedule because there were a number of outstanding issues in the database procedure behind the call hence why this was obviously my fault 
 & gt *me <unk> my tongue : * i 'm ... i 'm ok ... thanks 
 just calling about your requirements on the api which you sent <unk> ... & gt *douche : * oh this again 
 haven’t you finished that yet 
 & gt *me : * well no 
 you 'll remember that we 've delayed it due to some issues with the procedure which you 've been <unk> ... & gt *douche : * oh for the love <unk> why is it taking so long 
 & gt *me : * that 's what i wanted to ask about 
 requirement <unk> says its supposed to calculate x but lower down it states the maths you want it to use 
 the problem is that this <unk> does n't actually represent that <unk> ... & gt *douche : * look you 're supposed to follow the specification i 've written so just do it 
 i do n't want to hear about this again until its done 
 the next day my boss tells me that douche complained about me to his account manager saying that i was being offensive and was questioning his <unk> 
 he can read minds 
 i then completed this piece of work ensuring that his specification was followed to every exact instruction 
 **the turn : ** after the best part of 6 months and the client is about to go live with their site 
 they 've been trying to sort out their own internal testing teams and third parties for such a long time that we ended up completing the work a full 5 months before they were even able to test it and at this point they were going live in 3 days because that 's when their marketing <unk> said it would 
 because of these tight deadlines they signed it off in our acceptance testing <unk> and we considered the work to be complete 
 i had all but forgotten that previous conversation with douche 
 about <unk> friday afternoon greg from cs calls me up says he 's got an issue with douche 
 greg now knows first hand how <unk> douche can be 
 this is because after our work was completed and promoted to our live system any issues they had <unk> were not development issues but customer support issues 
 i make my way over to cs land and this is where things get fun 
 & gt *me : * 'sup greg 
 sipping my coffee because these usually involve a long conversation about the functionality of features & gt *greg : * hey <unk> ever worked on this new api that went up for & lt client_name & gt 
 & gt *me : * yeah i did the verification process on it 
 what do you want to know 
 & gt *greg : * the client seems to think it does n't work 
 & gt *me : * it was implemented to the letter 
 plus other clients have been picking it up and using it since it went out have n't they 
 & gt *greg : * yeah that 's what i thought when i read the documentation 
 ok leave it with me and i 'll let douche know 
 i head back to my desk and start pulling out all the documentation i have on this feature because i know exactly what 's coming next 
 after not too long steve the account manager for douche storms into qa and straight into boss office 
 there 's a lot of shouting and raised voices and eventually i 'm called in 
 & gt *steve : * would you care to explain this 
 steve points at an email on boss screen 
 i go in for a closer inspection and it 's an email from douche claiming that their launch is probably going to be a disaster because the api has <unk> not been tested at <unk> 
 i 'm surprised steve believes this because he knows me and i 've worked on various projects for him in the past 
 & gt *me : * i was firmly told my mr douche that i was to implement it to the specification 
 & gt *steve : * but the reporting section of the response that comes out is utter nonsense 
 it does n't make sense 
 & gt *boss : * derp what did the specification say about this 
 & gt *me : * i can grab the documentation from my desk if you like 
 & gt *boss : * i think that would be a good idea 
 i go and fetch the documents and all the eyes in the department are on me wanting to know what 's going on 
 on the way back i see boss trying to calm steve down 
 & gt *me : * here it is 
 i slide it across the desk and take a seat 
 steve and boss scan through it and find where it talks about these reporting figures and wait to be spoken to 
 steve turns a little pale and boss smiles 
 & gt *steve : * but that makes no sense 
 & gt *me : * i know 
 & gt *steve : * why did n't you raise this with the client 
 & gt *me : * i did 
 i then was accused of insulting the <unk> project manager and calling him incompetent 
 & gt *boss : * who wrote this specification 
 & gt *me : * douche over on their side did 
 i 'm pretty sure you two would have been cc 'd on the email when it came across 
 & gt *steve : * well what are we going to do 
 we have to fix this before they go live on sunday 
 it 's now <unk> friday afternoon & gt *boss : * no chance 
 we only release new code on monday or tuesday unless it 's a priority 1 issue 
 even then this is an api that multiple clients are now using and we 'll have to be careful not to break their <unk> 
 & gt *me : * steve you might want to look at section 21 on that document 
 steve quickly <unk> to this section of the documentation where the final clause states how any modifications to this <unk> as a change request and chargeable work 
 steve is much more calm because he knows his ass is covered 
 that and i 've made him some serious commission from <unk> like that in the past 
 & gt *steve : * ok wait there 
 steve now stands a chance to make a considerable amount of commission 
 the client wrote the requirements signed off the requirements signed off the work in acceptance testing and have only 32 hours before they launch 
 they will be willing to pay a significant sum to fund the overtime required from personnel to get this straight 
 **the <unk> : ** it 's <unk> and i am considering what i 'll spend my weekend doing 
 boss walks out of his office and comes over to me 
 & gt *boss : * can you just join me on a conference call 
 & gt *me : * if it 's quick 
 & gt *boss : * that 's up to you really 
 <unk> i follow him into his office where i can hear a much more humble sounding douche on the phone explaining to steve what needs to be done 
 & gt *boss : * steve i have derp here do you want to explain what the plan is 
 & gt *steve : * derp we really need to get this sorted 
 you worked on the original feature so you 'll know the best way to test this 
 we 're still working on getting someone to develop the change but we 'll be willing to pay you triple time this evening and tomorrow to work on this for sunday 
 we reckon we can do this patch without any impact to our other clients 
 & gt *douche : * i really need you to help me out here mate otherwise it 'll really hit the fan over here 
 i pause and enjoy this brief moment of pure justice 
 & gt *me : * i 've already made plans for this weekend and ... & gt *douche : * derp seriously you have to help me out here 
 & gt *me : * i don’t really feel like it 
 & gt *douche : * well someone needs to fix this 
 & gt *boss : * it 's 5pm on a friday 
 most staff are on their way home or out the door 
 sorry steve but it looks like it 'll have to wait until next week 
 douche rages down the phone and once this torrent of abuse <unk> steve lets me go back to my desk 
 i 'm packing up for the end of the day and my phone rings 
 & gt *me : * & lt company & gt derp <unk> ... & gt *douche : * please i need you to do this 
 & gt *me : * you need to sort this out and calling me wo n't help you 
 & gt *douche : * please i 'm sorry just help me out 
 & gt *me : * you have been extremely rude to me and insulted me whenever we 've spoken 
 your failure to listen to me is the sole reason you 're here right now 
 i did exactly what you asked and you have treated me with contempt every step of the way 
 i am not helping you 
 & gt *douche : * please ... he 's actually crying 
 you can hear it in the way his voice is all shaky 
 so i hang up and leave for my weekend 
 **the reveal : ** monday rolls around and steve introduces me to a new project manager for the client who 's organising the fix to the api 
 & gt *steve : * so derp this is <unk> 
 another project manager for & lt client_name & gt 
 & gt *me : * is douche not working on this project 
 & gt <unk> : * douche no longer works here 
 tl dr : douche pm for client writes spec for api 
 <unk> logic makes no sense pm thinks he 's <unk> 
 qa tech questions logic gets reported for being insulting 
 client does n't test the api signs it off anyway 
 it hits the fan release date is ruined 
 pm is in deep and <unk> for help 
 qa tech hangs up and enjoys weekend even more 
 previous i looked down at the three boys who stood in front of me 
 one stared back defiantly one was busy day dreaming and the third was busy eyeing redcheer who was another it staff member 
 & gt me : <unk> my mind raced to find an appropriate word kids <unk> 
 too <unk> 
 & gt me : … guys 
 so welcome to it i’m airz 
 today i’ll be assigning you each a mentor 
 they’ll guide you through your <unk> here 
 the boy who’d been busy eyeing redcheer quickly put his hand in the air 
 his shirt said <unk> so i was already worried about his life choices 
 & gt me : er… ya 
 & gt badshirt : can i have her as a mentor 
 badshirt pointed to redcheer 
 i was torn between his shirt and the eager look in his eye 
 redcheer however smiled 
 & gt redcheer : haha i’ll take you on 
 on one <unk> & gt badshirt : name it 
 anything 
 & gt redcheer : go home tonight change clothes then cut up that shirt 
 physically shred it 
 if you do that i’ll take you as my <unk> 
 badshirt seemed torn 
 he looked down at his shirt longingly 
 & gt badshirt : i’ll think about it 
 that exchange over i introduced the boys to the other it staff member solitaire who’d only agreed to take a student on the condition he got to pick which kid 
 after the introduction solitaire looked thoughtful 
 & gt solitaire : okay which of you <unk> play computer games 
 all three of the hands shot into the air 
 solitaire slightly smiled 
 & gt solitaire : who wants to work hard here 
 two of the hands shot up 
 the third the boy initially <unk> hesitantly rose 
 & gt solitaire : you young mr. hesitant you’re **my** <unk> 
 & gt redcheer : okay badshirt 
 you’re my <unk> the two boys walked away with there respective <unk> 
 i looked at the final boy he still seemed defiant but his eyes looked hurt 
 i smiled down at him 
 does <unk> work on <unk> boys 
 i asked it myself 
 & gt me : lucky me 
 i get the best student 
 & gt defiant : the best aren’t left till last 
 generally 
 ouch 
 i decided to recover by changing topics 
 & gt me : so what do you know about it 
 & gt defiant : more then most 
 i walked back to my office and gave defiant a seat 
 he didn’t seem like a happy young man 
 & gt me : anything specifically 
 any programming you’ve picked up or… stories about it you’ve done that you wan na tell 
 & gt defiant : <unk> easy 
 i waited for a follow up but… it never seemed to come 
 defiant wasn’t much of a <unk> 
 apparently 
 & gt me : lets get to work then 
 the ticket queue says there’s a network problem in accounting 
 lets go up and see 
 ***** arriving at the problem area i soon saw the problem 
 a networking cable had come off from the wall socket 
 i plugged it back in and the accounting computer afflicted starting working as normal 
 the accountant affected came back from a coffee break to find his machine working he started thanking me and defiant profusely 
 & gt acc : thank you 
 thank you 
 you’re so fast 
 & gt defiant : what you had here was a standard <unk> cable kick out 
 happens a lot as the cables get older the weaker plastic in the connector snaps and physical connections get hard to maintain 
 the accountant started looking worried 
 his eyes darted between me and defiant 
 & gt acc : a kick out 
 whats that 
 will it keep happening 
 i opened my mouth to respond but defiant was already talking 
 & gt defiant : best course of action 
 replace the cable if the connector has broken 
 luckily we’re examined the piece and can confirm it is still in fine shape 
 if it happens often we occasionally offer <unk> physical attachments to secure the cable however airz and i have discussed it and we believe it won’t be necessary in this case 
 & gt acc : er… well thank you 
 so much 
 as we walked away a million questions swamped my mind 
 & gt defiant : so this is all you do 
 plug in cables all day 
 & gt me : no… 
 what about you though all those words to just say <unk> in a cable” 
 what was that all about 
 & gt defiant : meh fun 
 meh 
 a word i’d hear a lot over the next two weeks 
 ***** as the three boys left the office after the first day i watched them leave with a smile 
 & gt redcheer : had fun today 
 this fortnight might not be so bad you know 
 & gt me : haha maybe 
 little did i know one of those three boys was the devil 
 next i am a semi retired semi burnt out old tech spending my declining years in a small rural town 
 i service a mixed bag of <unk> small business and <unk> clients 
 the work is varied 
 the clients are generally pleasant 
 there are exceptions 
 a solicitor ran a small legal office just him and a part time secretary shared a single computer 
 it died and naturally there was no backup 
 when i opened it up it was <unk> it had overheated and was shutting down randomly and half the caps where bulging 
 i replaced the motherboard dropped in a bigger hard drive upgraded from xp and recovered his data from the old drive 
 i even set up a simple backup using a couple external drives 
 the solicitor was happy i had saved his data and set him up with a much better computer 
 i invoiced him and that 's when the trouble started 
 he just did n't pay 
 no complaints from him he just ignored the bill 
 i tried gentle <unk> i tried appealing to his sense of fairness i tried letters demanding payment 
 nothing 
 eight months later the solicitor called frantic 
 he had tried to update practice management software he used and had failed 
 he could n't tell who owed him and would n't you know i was the only tech within a 200 <unk> <unk> with any experience with this software 
 i agreed to help him provided he settle the outstanding invoice in cash before i started working 
 when i arrived at his office he offered a cheque 
 i politely declined the offer and waited on his <unk> as went to the bank to <unk> the cash 
 when he returned i told him that the work would take around two hours to complete and sent him back to the bank to get the payment before i would start <unk> the actual job was simple i rolled the database back to the previous day upgraded it to the current release and then the program upgraded without a hitch 
 the best part was that the process took just over two and a half hours so at precisely two hours in i stopped work and asked for <unk> for another hour 
 the solicitor had enough cash on hand to avoid a third trip to the bank 
 i finished the job thanked him for the work and wished him a cheerful good day 
 tl/dr : solicitor does n't pay long outstanding bill but his own incompetence forces him to pay the account 
 not tech support but i do assist people with logging on to their internet accounts 
 generally this can be fairly straight forward but it always depends on the user at the other end 
 received a call from a lady born in the 20 's so pushing <unk> she was having trouble logging onto her out website 
 she had recently purchased a new computer everything else was set up correctly except for the issue of logging in 
 when you click login the login screen appears in a pop-up but nothing was showing on her screen 
 she was unable to advise me what browser she was using so i had her described her toolbars etc 
 turns out she was using chrome finally get her through the process enable pop-up etc and she is able to log in 
 she told me at the end of the call that she had sought assistance from her son who had given up in frustration been to our retail store who were unable to help 
 it took me over 30 minutes to get her there she did n't lose patience or get stressed and we kept battling away 
 it was nice to assist someone that appreciated rather than the majority of callers who do n't listen to what you say 
 tl/dr : <unk> an old lady with a <unk> a few days ago i get a call from a client who is hysterical 
 she immediately starts with ive really screwed up '' 
 whats the problem '' 
 i ask 
 i accidentally emailed my computer to a client '' 
 at this point i 'm just thinking *oh ... honey no 
 * but i match her level of urgency and get her to remote me in and explain what is happening 
 after i get connected she shows me the email she sent and it had a zip file attached 
 i just wanted to send one file but when i open it up my whole computer is in there '' 
 she claims 
 she proceeds to double click on the zip file which opens in explorer and of course shows her disk drives and network shares on the side 
 i double checked and forwarded it to someone else here and they saw my whole computer too '' well of course they saw the same thing 
 everyone has a c drive and they all have the same network folders 
 i figured out who she forwarded it to so i could explain how wrong they both were and closed the ticket 
 tldr : woman emails zip file thinks whole computer got emailed because zip files open in explorer and her sidebar is in <unk> received a ticket that a user is n't able to access one of the online tools that we have 
 it runs on java but because it has n't been updated it ca n't use a version higher than java <unk> 
 i 've dealt with it many times before i just remove whatever version is installed install <unk> and set security permissions 
 sometimes java updates due to some end users having local admin rights because they are developers or constantly traveling 
 this guy is a developer 
 i remotely connected and saw the site not displaying properly i checked the java settings and they were correct but the site still gave issues 
 i logged in with my admin account and opened up programs and features to find a long list of <unk> software on his computer 
 me : ok besides java i have to remove a lot of these programs you should not have skype the android sdk these root applications for phones a bunch of these actually '' 
 user is hesitant but says ok but as soon as i start removing java he begins flipping out saying i ruined his java sdk environment 
 all i removed was the <unk> run time environment 
 user : i need these applications 
 you ruined my install 
 you abuse your power 
 i will report you for this '' 
 me : i didnt ruin anything i removed the <unk> environment your sdk is not involved with it 
 the <unk> is used by the browser '' 
 after struggling to let me finish he flips out again 
 he tells me he 's going to report me for breaking '' his computer 
 i confirmed the site is working 
 user : this is ridiculous why are you forcing me to use an old version of java for this site 
 if i knew this i wouldnt have had you change anything 
 who are you to decide we use this '' 
 me : i didnt decide anything these are the rules that are in place the <unk> of the internal site did not add support for newer versions of java this is what you have to use in order to use the site '' 
 he starts getting <unk> again claiming it 's all my fault and then slams the phone down 
 i called my manager on his personal cell phone to tell him what happened 
 after telling him about me abusing my power '' : boss : abusing your power my ass there are rules in place 
 he 's running loads of unauthorized software 
 no one says that shit to my team 
 we 'll talk in the morning about this i 'm going to find this user and rip his computer away from him to remove all unauthorized software and his admin rights 
 i 'm going to speak with his manager too '' if anyone wants an update tomorrow let me know edit : i didnt tell my boss that skype was installed that 's a security violation here 
 i can smell justice already 
 - <unk> : my boss is in meetings but will talk to me about what happened do n't worry guys i 'll get you an update update previous <unk> across my desk at the company consultant i realize my <unk> coffee is absent 
 as i get up to retrieve it from the break room i’m interrupted 
 & gt con : airz 
 have you been listening to a single thing i’ve been saying 
 & gt me : umm just getting up to get some coffee 
 & gt con : what was i just talking about 
 & gt me : do you 
 want coffee 
 i looked over at the break room my mug sitting silently on the shelf 
 & gt con : oh errr you’re so nice you could tell i was getting thirsty 
 i smiled coffee was in my <unk> 
 i started to walk over to the break room 
 & gt con : you haven’t asked how i take it yet 
 & gt me : oh… 
 & gt con : obviously we already have a connection you probably already know 
 i looked between the milk and sugar 
 two percent full skim white raw <unk> - too many choices 
 & gt me : how do you take your coffee 
 & gt con : <unk> come on 
 trust your instincts 
 with no help i decided i’d go the middle road 
 & gt con : while you’re over there i might take a quick look at the anonymous ideas box 
 i smiled 
 & gt me : read them out we can go through it together now 
 & gt con : first one says anything from <unk> 
 what the hell is this 
 & gt me : pffff… people are weird 
 read out the next one 
 i grabbed a glass and poured all the different types of milk together 
 stirring naturally so they combined 
 & gt con : oh this one says it should aggregate a list of music that 's popular and get people to vote 
 okay music 
 am i missing something 
 & gt me : errr… i guess we’re missing something together 
 i realized how weird that sounded 
 it didn’t matter i was too busy <unk> every type of sugar to make super <unk> sugar 
 & gt con : oh together 
 & gt me : try the next idea 
 & gt con : please don’t play any rap music i hate rap music if i had to listen to it i’d probably die 
 oh and i don’t like country either 
 i looked up at the shelf that held coffee 
 instant or … brewed 
 & gt con : sounds like people don’t like it when it plays music 
 & gt me : yeah i guess we should write that down 
 & gt con : yes 
 finally some feed back we can use 
 i decided to be nice 
 brewed coffee went into the cup along with the super sugar and <unk> milk 
 i handed it over to the company consultant 
 & gt con : thanks honey one more email i think 
 & gt me : sure 
 & gt con : it should have a timer so we know how long its been from the moment we make a ticket till the moment they arrive at our desk 
 the company consultant looked down at her coffee 
 she took a sip 
 & gt con : what the **** is this <unk> brilliant 
 i hope she was talking about the coffee 
 … 
 please be talking about the coffee

 ** ___ previous tales 
 there 's not too many and some suck but enjoy after conducting an in-depth investigation i got all that happened 
 so picture this if you will : secretary at my workplace gets an ordinary '' looking email 
 the sender is labeled as facebook email consists of a facebook logo some text which pretty much says you 've got a new message with an attachment '' and there 's a zip file attached which <unk> & lt <unk> 
 naturally this fine secretary has to do her job and figure out what this attachment contains 
 & gt save as - & gt open & gt ... zip archive disappears and she closes the popup ... the confused secretary tries again 
 & gt save as - & gt open & gt ... what 
 why does it disappear 
 it 's personal now 
 our <unk> is determined she will <unk> in opening this attachment one way or another 
 some minutes of running in loops miss secretary realizes the vital component of this battle for honor 
 it 's the antivirus ... & gt <unk> - & gt temporarily disable protection already feeling the taste of victory she proceeds to open the attachment 
 & gt '' can not open file : it does not appear to be a valid archive '' oh my god 
 & gt the stupid antivirus broke the email 
 i better ask the person to send it again 
 & gt reply - & gt <unk> @ <unk> <unk> that 's cool email lets me respond directly to the person even though its from facebook 
 technology is so cool 
 * & gt hello & gt i have received your message with the attachment but the antivirus program broke the attachment 
 could you please send it again to my personal email 
 <unk> @ <unk> & gt regards & gt best secretary ever several days pass with no answer 
 the whole broken attachment business gets forgotten completely and everyone is happy 
 until today ... & gt her : hello it guy can you come take a look at my computer 
 it does n't work 
 & gt me : sure lets go take a look 
 we get to her computer and a <unk> warm sight of <unk> <unk> cryptolocker ransom <unk> greets me 
 to be precise it was <unk> to <unk> the awkward silence she <unk> this gem : & gt her : oh i was thinking of getting coffee with colleagues while you fix this 
 i immediately start asking questions about backups and if she put them on the <unk> i gave her 
 as expected every single answer consisted of either * '' no '' * * '' <unk> '' * or * '' i do n't know '' * she also managed to somehow turn <unk> and other backup <unk> off 
 obviously everyone wants me to recover the data because there was a lot of important data in there 
 talking 2 years of documents 
 i 'm pretty sure we 're switching to linux soon ... tl dr secretary uses her adamant willpower and idiocy to open attachment that contained a cryptolocker 
 all files are <unk> 
 this whole thing could be compared to telling a mentally <unk> kid to not put his finger in the meat <unk> and then getting shouted at because he did <unk> am one-man it for a small company 
 i need a file from $ hr_lady 
 hey $ hr_lady can you email me this file i need '' 
 it 's actually on the x drive 
 do you have access to that '' 
 yeah i have access to ... 
 everything '' 
 really '' 
 well yeah i 'm the it guy '' 
 not the hr drive 
 you ca n't have access to that '' 
 okay uh then i wo n't give myself access to that 
 analog cable is dying all over allowing our cable telco to use the broad spectrum range that once had to be dedicated to <unk> video feeds to better use 
 one of the cooler ways we 're putting all this substantial bandwidth capacity to use was actually suggested by my better half who pushed to set up a test node where we 'd <unk> all <unk> up bandwidth <unk> to expand our internet multiband capabilities 
 it required new multiband modems able to handle a lot more qams than those we used for years but we might now actually hold a record on <unk> speeds over copper wire thanks to that 
 it 's still just tests and as marketing has other ideas about how to use some of the <unk> qams it 's likely that the new plans we 'll ultimately offer wo n't get as many bands nor reach the same speeds as we 're currently testing 
 but still it 's cool to reach <unk> speeds normally available only with fiber over plain old cable 
 as usual i ended up on the <unk> test <unk> for that project 
 i 've learned long ago that whenever you 're assigned to any sort of special team for something new and <unk> even if it 's as simple as doing something we already offer on a greater scale you get <unk> <unk> on almost everything and given a wide <unk> by management so i 'm always the first volunteer 
 this was one of my first calls on the dedicated line set up for issues about it 
 & gt bytewave : <unk> project you have tsss bytewave '' 
 & gt jack : hey this is jack road tech <unk> install 
 i have insane packet loss on this install need your eyes 
 probably radio frequency issue but my meter is n't being helpful it 's like the line is dead but the modem actually <unk> up fine despite the packet loss '' 
 & gt bytewave : sure just a sec '' 
 ... & gt bytewave : got it 
 the traditional <unk> range is all clear which is why you 're technically online 
 but every and each <unk> frequency is red 
 the most logical explanation would be <unk> '' & gt jack : <unk> 
 i already checked the panel for this 
 gim me a minute i 'll find the damn thing '' 
 and he puts me on hold without me even having to explain 
 i literally had a sigh of <unk> 
 that 's another perk of project <unk> they actually put good techs on them 
 he instantly knew what i was gon na say 
 i <unk> the customer 's file trying to find any evidence that an analog passive filter is installed on grounds but found none 
 long ago when analog piracy was <unk> and hilariously easy install a splitter get your neighbor 's cable 
 the best way the telco had to limit it was to install analog filters whenever techs noticed such setups 
 normally they 'd be pretty easy to find and documented but many years before i started here documentation standards were less than <unk> and/or <unk> to a system that long went out of production so we lost track of some 
 furthermore though they were designed to be difficult to remove some crafty <unk> customers found ways around these to keep <unk> cable 
 so <unk> techs used to hide the analog filters <unk> in certain cases such as if they believed the customer had <unk> with one or bypassed it 
 minutes later ... & gt jack : i 'm not even mad this is amazing 
 the drop coming in here goes through the <unk> and this customer 's analog filter was hidden in there <unk> one i 've ever seen 
 wish i knew if he lived here back when this was installed '' 
 obviously by scrambling the frequencies once used for analog this was the cause of the massive packet loss on <unk> 
 & gt bytewave : lem me just log on recoveries tools ... annddd that 's a yes 
 we 've had the person living there as a paying customer for 16 years but there 's a note about the potential from 24 years ago about analog piracy naming the resident by name and it 's a match 
 but we wo n't be able to actually ... '' & gt jack : yeah i know the drill we got ta pretend we do n't know 
 anyhow now we have 0 % <unk> <unk> full <unk> 
 thanks for the assist i 'm out '' 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 not much of a story but i recently started a job as the technology guy at a school 
 this is okay but for some reason we allow teachers and other staff to set priority on tickets themselves 
 this naturally leads to practically every ticket being marked as high or urgent 
 above that are emergency and critical which they apparently ca n't see or no doubt i 'd be <unk> with emergency and critical tickets about coming down to change printer ink cartridges or something 
 in any case i take enormous satisfaction in <unk> most tickets to low or <unk> was a typical spring day in britain : unnaturally cold yet the sun shone with <unk> <unk> 
 it was the kind of weather where you need a few layers of clothing but with sunglasses as well 
 in fact it was on this day i pondered when people are cold they wear shirts jumpers <unk> <unk> ... why never anything on the legs 
 why has nobody invented jumpers for legs '' 
 this <unk> moment kept me company all the way to the office that morning <unk> this <unk> 
 a week had elapsed since the jon6 vs angie showdown 
 we were playing angie 's <unk> <unk> her new court rules to the letter and sought permission for every single visit to the it cupboard 
 sometimes it was a stern and sharp no 
 other times it was a reluctant yes but only after waving a ticket number in front of her face 
 such a <unk> session would always be followed up with her dropping in at intervals which appeared to be so very desperately random 
 the <unk> was obvious : we were obviously <unk> <unk> responsibilities and up to no good 
 her grand <unk> into the cupboard where the handle was turned even before her security card had finished <unk> was as if to catch us in some red act that she could grow fat on 
 for me given my near permanent residence there i <unk> a rather fun game trying to estimate when these visits would occur 
 if i could time it right i would make a visit to user 's <unk> <unk> just in time to pass her in the corridor on her way to the it cupboard so i could nonchalantly whistle a happy tune just going about my business 
 i managed to pull this off a few times 
 she would have her stinking coffee in one hand handbag <unk> for another session of studying me as i worked reprimanding anything she felt like only to be caught out because i was on my way out 
 those few times i 'd pass her in the corridor like this her <unk> grey eyes would stare straight ahead <unk> by her forehead <unk> after many years of just <unk> hating everything just as if i just did n't exist 
 this eventually stopped being fun as i would often find she would just sit and wait for my return to the it cupboard her presence just a <unk> spectral shadow in the background like a <unk> balanced rock perched on a <unk> as in those cartoons 
 she would come and go as she pleased seemingly annoyed in my indifference occasionally <unk> into fits of sharp <unk> where i could n't do right for doing wrong 
 the sad reality is it was n't all fun and games 
 angie 's frequent verbal attacks accusatory questioning tactics and consistent throwing of <unk> in the works made for a very stressful working environment for everyone in the team 
 there were many occasions where her actions and whims would cause a ticket to go wrong in some fashion leaving the team to try to pick up the pieces 
 in one incident qbg had a traveling sales rep due to see her about a usb hard disk he was having trouble with 
 she had correctly diagnosed most likely a failure of the actual hard disk and had requested a new usb disk to await his arrival where she would transfer any data he needed 
 however one of my tickets was a simple request for a new usb hard disk which i had duly placed on the purchase order list 
 angie knowing that qbg had the last usb drive in stock had mafg complete my ticket using the same usb drive qbg had waiting in her desk drawer 
 mafg was unaware of qbg 's ticket i was aware of qbg 's ticket but not that mafg had been told to go and action mine using qbg 's hard disk 
 when qbg found out the rep was already at her desk waiting to pick up his new drive 
 little things like that seemed all too commonplace now 
 even though angie had caused it it would just look like our own incompetence <unk> by this total bitch 
 i was particularly reminded of the <unk> <unk> ... turning man against his brother until man exists no more '' 
 i think what irritated angie was that in the face of this <unk> i always stood up and <unk> customers 
 in the above case qbg was close to tears with an angry rep on her hands - this had been agreed between them for at least a week 
 angie sat happily clicking around touchpaper while the rep blew up 
 i <unk> straight in and simply took liability claiming an administrative oversight 
 qbg and several others on the team were <unk> they looked to me for mentoring advice ... who was i to leave them in the <unk> 
 i managed to appease this rep by offering to run out to the local pc world and grab one up for him 
 just one of the many incidents angie seemed to <unk> 
 added to that my <unk> nokia was suffering frequent call drops 
 i missed my blackberry 
 tuesday came - our <unk> epic induction session arrived fresh from birmingham 
 mafg and i stood by the training room windows as <unk> of lads and <unk> from <unk> north '' stepped off the coach 
 we knew full well that they would be in no mood for sitting straight down for a <unk> it session 
 it appears that my inspiration to order fresh tea coffee and bacon rolls for their arrival was a good one 
 as the delegates stormed the <unk> of the training rooms armed with smiles and northern <unk> galore all <unk> <unk> at our offering of breakfast 
 there was much joy to be had 
 i could n't help but notice angie 's <unk> presence at the back of the room as she sat <unk> and miserable waiting for us to start 
 one of the new ladies quipped at me in her birmingham accent who 's that <unk> at the back '' 
 after explaining she was my manager she instantly <unk> with a cheerful laugh and blimey ya poor sod '' 
 mafg and i split the groups into two <unk> pieces 
 i thought that this may throw angie the dilemma of having to balance her disapproving looks between two rooms closely monitoring and judging our every moves 
 it seemed however she was perfectly happy to sit motionless at the back of my session at every moment <unk> her eyes on me 
 she would ensure her comments were delivered at every coffee break which seemed like orders and <unk> over every minor detail 
 her opportunity for managerial admonishment was stolen from her again one of the delegate 's new laptop had suddenly failed at the start of the session 
 angie motioned about to take control and give me a solid dressing down until she was stopped in her tracks when i produced one of the three spare laptops always prepared in advance just in case such a circumstance ever happened 
 i swapped the machine over had the delegate log in and noted the new asset number for changing on ad later 
 angie 's fingers were red as they clutched her coffee cup 
 she was almost pissed that i had n't slipped up 
 yet again there was no hope of lunch as angie ordered me to go and see hr tank with her slow '' pc 
 again it turned out hrt had simply decided waiting 10 seconds for a newly inserted cd-rom to spin up was far too slow and was causing her severe <unk> - nothing to do with all that <unk> then 
 after pulling several late nights the week previous to get laptops finished phone contracts organised and hardware charged the whole session went off without a hitch 
 of course there were the usual attacks of angie 's bitter comments 
 through it all i did my best to ignore her and instead maintained a <unk> <unk> with my inductees 
 about 2pm angie <unk> out of the room 
 she looked past me as she walked out as if she had gathered everything she needed to know and was off to put some other part of her devious plan into operation 
 her departure sparked a brief conversation about what a <unk> old woman she was and how they could never work for such a wench 
 i resisted the <unk> to spill my <unk> break down and tell this group of happy individuals what hell we were going through 
 i simply chose to leave it as yes she is very difficult '' 
 the afternoon ticked by to its conclusion 
 eventually the last delegate left the training room armed with laptop off to make their way in the world 
 mafg and i sat drinking the last few drops of weak <unk> coffee from the <unk> looking out of the same window where we first saw the delegates arrive 
 we could see their coach driver perched on one of the front seats reading a newspaper and drinking from a <unk> <unk> looking totally relaxed in the world 
 we sat quietly comparing <unk> on the delegates we had just met <unk> ourselves on a job well done 
 i had left the door open neither mafg or i noticed angie 's skeletal figure appear in the doorway 
 our discreet <unk> of the day were cut short with her <unk> <unk> exactly what is the meaning of this 
 who gave you permission to sit around what is this a <unk> '' 
 we both startled <unk> her voice almost shattered the glass 
 as we began clearing up equipment powering down projectors and clearing desks of discarded <unk> angie <unk> a full force <unk> of the day 
 i do n't see why this whole process had to take so long 
 maybe if you 'd had stopped <unk> talking rubbish and making jokes this whole thing could have been a lot quicker '' 
 we knew that no <unk> would have worked with angie 
 she continued to berate us for another 20 minutes as we cleared the room down 
 just as we were ready to close up we could n't help but notice that another figure had appeared in the room 
 she was about 20 <unk> in a <unk> suit and could n't help but <unk> the fact that she was new to the company 
 she stood with <unk> and meekly knocked on the door 
 excuse me '' she said 
 is mafg in here '' 
 after acknowledging his presence she <unk> <unk> up to mafg and handed him an official looking envelope his name and address on the front 
 she left the room just as abruptly as she had arrived making sure not to make eye contact with anyone not even to the <unk> look from angie 
 mafg and i with a box of bits and projectors in hand looked perplexed at what had just happened 
 angie left with the snipe i want you both back downstairs in 20 minutes after you 've put that stuff away 
 and i want all your tickets reviewed by the end of the day '' 
 we made our way to the sanctuary of the it cupboard and returned the gear to its rightful <unk> space 
 mafg opened the letter reading it aloud as his eyes <unk> into his <unk> 
 there it was 
 the letter was from hr <unk> with every official looking signature and stamp that you could possibly throw onto such a document 
 it stated he was to attend a meeting tomorrow with hr angie and bhit 
 it also stated you may choose to have a representative accompany you ... '' this was it ... angie had made her first move in her new game 
 and it certainly seemed that the first <unk> would be one of my closest <unk> : mafg 
 this terrible moment was mocked at the sight of the delegates <unk> their <unk> bus 
 they were escaping the <unk> of this situation off to their lives of freedom and <unk> to look forward to 
 a clear contrast to ours mired in the <unk> of some hateful hag who it seemed had only just started 
 mafg did n't return to its that day i agreed to do his late shift for him allowing his escape at 4pm to go collect his thoughts 
 angie had just upped the game 
 and we felt powerless to do anything about it

 his <unk> just as <unk> and <unk> as angie’s <unk> over mafg’s old desk space in <unk> his mannerisms and movements <unk> similar to his mother’s 
 his keyboard and mouse <unk> as though he would <unk> some sort of <unk> as he worked as if to <unk> claim permanent ownership 
 roland’s voice though <unk> and <unk> bore all the same <unk> and <unk> <unk> which angie would spit out on a daily basis 
 his eyes almost <unk> like as if they would <unk> the skin if he stared long enough 
 i had just spent a glorious week on annual leave putting finishing <unk> to my <unk> <unk> 
 the ugly situation at work had been far from my mind as i enjoyed every minute of my creative <unk> 
 sunday marked the <unk> day of my freedom by bringing with it the feeling of impending doom 
 by monday morning my <unk> to work seemed <unk> as my attention was constantly <unk> to the clock in my car 
 it ticked by the minutes towards 9:30am and my arrival back in this gloomy pit where angie stood lord and master 
 my foot barely wanted to touch the <unk> pedal these thoughts did something to my <unk> which i felt forced to fight 
 my entrance into its was barely noted by the <unk> whose faces seemed <unk> on their own screens as if to break for a moment would feel the wrath of some frosty <unk> 
 roland’s bleak personality <unk> throughout the small department like a bad smell only <unk> by angie who sat mere meters away 
 fighting through this black air i sat at my desk 
 as outlook churned into life the email traffic of the previous week <unk> down my unread pane the main view providing snippets of what had transpired my absence 
 the hard disk ticked and <unk> the led flashing in sympathy in its race to return to life after a week starved of power 
 the unmistakable apprehensive walk of the balding head of it came into view as he arrived at my desk desperately maintaining as <unk> a pose as he could muster despite his <unk> 
 he <unk> his usual brand of pleasantries as our exchange turned to the important business of the rollout project 
 all appeared to be well in bhit’s world 
 the machines from dell were on order to be delivered in batches the pilot group had been well informed the software vendor was <unk> and the relevant sales managers seemed to enthusiastically <unk> all round his every action 
 i started discussing <unk> details “i want to get at least one of the builds done today as a first draft 
 it’s better to get it done early so there’s more time to <unk> issues and build <unk> <unk> expression altered as if to purposely show confusion 
 “oh ” he <unk> 
 “i was under the impression the first draft build was done ” i hadn’t heard the shrill of angie’s voice in a while but its tone was just as familiar as if i had endured it all my life 
 without even turning around in her chair to face us her words <unk> us with all the same bitterness “the first build is done 
 someone else did it while you weren’t here ” angie’s tone was mired in the suggestion that my <unk> week off had proven me <unk> another spit in the face from this <unk> rat 
 roland took his cue as if they were both reading from some <unk> score “yes i did it 
 it wasn’t that hard really just install everything and domain register it.” his <unk> insight into my carefully honed art was if to <unk> all that i had worked for and write it off as if he had found it <unk> and inconsequential 
 “there’s far more than that ” i <unk> 
 “you need to add the office wi-fi vpn antivirus <unk> angie’s retort was sudden and <unk> 
 “it’s been dealt with 
 roland is doing the builds 
 you would know that if you had read the <unk> project plan in your email 
 you said yourself that junior members need to have training as part of the project 
 he will consult you as needed ” it seemed roland had been <unk> promoted again this time within the <unk> of his own team 
 i was now roland’s bitch 
 bhit seemed as if he would have done anything at that moment to disappear into a cloud of smoke as the rest of its still sat motionless with their eyes <unk> into their pc screens pretending not to hear this <unk> going off around them 
 my hint at checking roland’s work was again <unk> <unk> angie this time turned her chair to face me her eyes like <unk> <unk> with her <unk> <unk> eyebrows 
 her skeletal pointy chin moved in harmony with her bark as she added finality to this conversation 
 “you have other things to be getting on with 
 read the project plan and get back to work 
 roland will consult you when he needs you ” knowing there was no win here i returned to my screen outlook waiting like an <unk> dog with <unk> unread emails 
 i looked at bhit with a silent sigh expecting him to <unk> in some way 
 instead he just shuffled away obviously completely ill-equipped to properly deal with what had just happened 
 he <unk> some empty promise of catching up with me later but this was drowned out by the sifting sound his suit made as it <unk> him away 
 angie had been busy in my absence 
 an email forwarded to all the major players in this assignment was <unk> with a send date of 10pm sunday evening – two days after i was last in the office - as if to prove angie’s so-called dedication to the cause 
 it was a <unk> of my <unk> and scrupulous project plan except my involvement in almost every <unk> stage had been written out like a poorly written character in some <unk> <unk> 
 roland’s new found <unk> of the <unk> seemed all too purposeful 
 angie had painstakingly placed me in the <unk> of the entire rollout <unk> our newest arrival her son into the most delicate of tasks 
 the rat had <unk> to a position of power 
 i hated what had become of the project 
 my considerable and <unk> planning had been cast aside like a cheap newspaper as angie lay claim to its <unk> in her <unk> to establish herself at the top of the food chain ensuring that any credit traveling up would end with her 
 in a last <unk> attempt to fight back i emailed my concerns to bhit 
 the time scales of the project and angie’s apparent and purposeful <unk> of my responsibilities meant that the rollout was now very <unk> to failure 
 i <unk> my words for nearly an hour <unk> a fine balance of concern without appearing confrontational 
 finally after much deliberation i took an all or nothing stance 
 i added a personal addendum in which i <unk> about angie’s disruptive nature within support her constant <unk> and micromanagement her <unk> tongue and angry terminal attitude bhit needed to get involved now and reign this beast back in 
 i couldn’t help but notice roland <unk> over one of the new dell laptops his prize that accompanied his birth right 
 no expense had been spared on these machines <unk> to by the fresh sleek black appearance 
 it was now being painted with roland’s <unk> <unk> hands the slimy <unk> unnaturally obvious underneath the <unk> office lighting 
 i felt a sense of <unk> like my obvious experience had been made irrelevant against this <unk> <unk> ignorance 
 silence followed as the email disappeared from my <unk> 
 the feeling i had was that this had either sealed my fate or marked a major turning point for the better 
 ten minutes went by still no response from bhit 
 i sat eagerly awaiting the outlook balloon which would at least acknowledge bhit’s reading of my <unk> 
 instead came the unmistakable sound of bhit <unk> rising from his chair the <unk> of his suit seemed signatory as it served to <unk> his escape out of the office towards the main stairs 
 i was alone in hell with angie her spawn and several <unk> broken and burned out its engineers 
 **previous** pt1 : a new world order pt2 : safety first pt3 : the it induction from hell pt4 : undercurrents pt5 : how to make friends and ... pt6 : marking territories pt7 : one friday to rue them all pt8 : best laid plans pt9 : its one step for man pt10 : ... and one step back for its pt11 : bring home the solider pt12 : who needs minor victories ... pt13 : dawn of a new nightmare pt14 : rules of engagement pt15 : bring out your dead pt16 : the greatest trick the devil ever pulled ... this happened two years ago but i will never forget this it was quite a memorable call 
 for accuracy this caller was a middle aged <unk> woman from <unk> 
 background : i did tier <unk> tech support for isp tier 2 plus direct access to scheduling and talking to the technicians in canada 
 this is around 8pm this woman calls very upset her internet has n't been working properly for 3 months and she was getting silly issues all the departments would give her the runaround nobody would actually sit there solve the issue 
 the call gets escalated to me and i see the list of tickets and her issue was clear her profile was set too high and the modem was just not able to hit those frequencies and would constantly drop dsl she also seemed to have a bad filter 
 no biggie really 
 now to make this clear this is the 9th call she puts in to us and 3 months that she 's getting frequent <unk> and constant slow <unk> 
 so i get this call going through the regular process making sure that everything has been checked before continuing with the fix procedure and i could hear the tv and her 5 year old in the back playing she told me her <unk> daughter was there and after <unk> minutes i hear the woman say spit it out spit it out 
 i asked if everything was ok and she said not to worry 
 i continue 
 3 minutes later i hear the little girl say <unk> my stomach and throat are burning 
 my mouth feels strange too 
 again i was a little worried at this point as the woman was already <unk> with this ordeal of not fixing she pressed for me to continue with the fix 
 but this time i asked what happened as her daughter was clearly in trouble and she said i shit you not 
 she drank some of the bleach i had in a cup over there '' 
 then proceeds to tell her daughter to go and try and throw up 
 me having done <unk> the week before and having a little common sense knew that that was not the right thing to do tell the woman no 
 call poison control 
 you ca n't make her throw up you 're just going to make it worst '' 
 so she tells her to go drink lots of water 
 at this point i 'm ready to shit myself this woman stressed out cause she kept getting the run around finally found somebody that seems like he can solve her problem tried to press forward 
 at this point i stressed again call poison control 
 call an ambulance 
 this is your child 
 and then she said this is saturday night btw we 're going to church tomorrow morning god will take care of her '' i fucking lost it 
 having all her info i tell her i must terminate the call 
 i hung up already having googled poison control for the area run to the staff room and call poison control 
 the guy on the other end thought it was a joke some dude from tech support calling from <unk> away is freaking out telling him that a customer 's child just <unk> bleach 
 i give him my name and all her details phone number <unk> at this point i was stressed out <unk> a smoke from a co-worker i do n't smoke but boys that was a fucking amazing cigarette and afterwards went back inside and called the woman again 
 she 's hysterical 
 crying freaking out she thought it was the emergency services again 
 but no it was the internet tech support guy the guy who made the woman realize that she could of lost her daughter 
 she thanked me and hung up as she was waiting on the ambulance 
 the following thursday i call the woman back her internet still not working started crying and telling me how great it was for me to care so much in a time where her thoughts were shadowed by her problems 
 her daughter ended up being fine and needed her stomach flushed and stayed in the hospital for a few days as she <unk> a bit 
 i solved her problem and that was that 
 that there is my most memorable call 
 tl dr. called poison control for small child that drank bleach because her mother was too worried about getting her internet finally working again after months of issues 
 later on i 'll post about my second most memorable call if you guys <unk> internet tech support aka suicide prevention line 
 edit : wow 
 thanks for all the great comments guys i really did n't think it was a big deal 
 i just did what i felt was right as my parents taught me 
 if you want to thank somebody thank my parents for giving me good values and common sense 
 edit 2 : as promised here is the long story about the suicide prevention tech support call i had a few months before this 
 warning wall of text edit 3 : thanks to whoever gave me reddit gold 
 i appreciate it 
 and thank you everybody i did n't know this would make the top like that ever since i was a little boy i wanted to do something in it 
 fiddled with tech since i was 13 and tried to go after the right degree 
 school could never hold my <unk> but i still managed to get in at an it support helpdesk wich i really like just not the users 
 every once in a while you get a good user the ones that listen and do exactly what you ask 
 then <unk> there are users like the following <unk> dish of hate for the customer $ pdoh $ sa for senior agent and $ me 
 & gt $ me : speaking with brain at helpdesk wich abuse would you like to lay on me 
 * i can only assume this is what the user heard * & gt $ pdoh : what did you do to our systems 
 my pc does n't work and i ca n't print anything 
 & gt $ me : <unk> credentials and vital info for our logging system* & gt $ pdoh : you know <unk> well wich pc this is 
 you ruined it 
 & gt $ me : sir i ca n't help you if you wo n't tell me the information i need to log this ticket in the system 
 & gt $ pdoh : yes you can you just dont want to fix this 
 & gt $ me : sir i would like to help you but if you keep yelling at me i will end this call 
 *at this point its safe to not i have been at this company for 6 months so i have no idea how to handle rude callers no protocol in <unk> & gt $ pdoh : i want to speak to a supervisor 
 & gt $ me : okay i will transfer you please hold on 
 <unk> note my supervisor is sitting at the desk next to me with a look of horror on his face as he heard most of the user yell 
 * & gt $ sa : supervisor helpdesk speaking what can i do for you 
 & gt $ pdoh : <unk> as fucking <unk> yes i would like to file a complaint versus the agent i spoke to he was very rude all the while i was just trying to get a replacement for my screen since i <unk> broke it and he would just yell at me 
 & gt $ sa : sir these are very serious claims it may even cost the agent his job 
 i will surely have a harsh word with my agent but if you want to file a official complaint we <unk> take this up with hr 
 & gt $ pdoh : yes i would like to make an official complaint i just wanted to work and now i am stuck here with a screen that is barely functioning 
 & gt $ sa : i will take it up and let you know our following step towards our agent who as you say <unk> you 
 i also ordered a new screen and it will arrive anything between now and 2 weeks 
 & gt $ pdoh : thank you so much for your help 
 i know we can trust the supervisors 
 this all happened 2 days ago and i had a meeting with my supervisor and our direct boss 
 we all listened to the tape since every employee signs their contract in wich it states every internal phone call gets recorded most users dont care and <unk> but whenever a official complaint is launched it is used 
 i knew what was coming my supervisor knew our boss sat there and <unk> n't even believe what he was hearing 
 i am in no problem at all but i got a feeling the user might ge written up or maybe get fired since this is a serious misconduct 
 where i live the law protects employees very well but i dont think it will protect him from being a lying <unk> 
 tl : dr : im paid to work not to get abused 
 edit : i can <unk> formatting i 'm still not sure exactly what went wrong here but this crazy woman called me up to have her boss fired 
 i 'm not talking about her supervisor by boss i mean the owner of the company 
 first some background i have this client that we do n't get too many calls from because the company is pretty small and to keep costs down the owner <unk> that you have to know how to use a computer before you 're allowed to work on one 
 so most of the calls we get are for actual computer problems 
 the whole company is owned by one single man and he 's an okay person i 've talked to him 
 then yesterday i get a strange call 
 now this lady who called is shall we say <unk> 
 i 've tried to recreate they way she says things in order to give you an idea of how it went 
 despite that i have n't gotten it all in there verbatim not that i 'd want to 
 **me : ** helpdesk this is wonderweirdo **crazy lady : ** this is crazy lady i just fired boss and i need you to delete all his passwords 
 **me : ** excuse me you just fired boss 
 **crazy lady : ** i have n't told him yet i want you to kill his passwords so he ca n't get on the computer or get into the building 
 **me : ** confused uh ma'am for any termination we need a termination notice to be sent to us by hr and that may be a tall order for him he owns the company 
 **crazy lady : ** he does n't own <unk> 
 that useless motherfucker just had my brothers car towed out of the parking lot 
 his ass is fired delete his codes now before i come upstairs looking for you 
 **me : ** sends im to manager to listen in hold on a second i ca n't just delete his access over the phone besides he 's the owner of the company he signs the paychecks 
 **crazy lady : ** fuck you <unk> motherfucker you 're fired too 
 get your ass out of here before i come upstairs and fuck you up '' 
 **me : ** you do realize this is a recorded line you may wan na take a deep breath there 
 **crazy lady : ** lots of <unk> language and threats just then my manager signals me to end the call 
 i just hang up and my manager tells me he 's pulling the recording and sending it up 
 a half hour later i 'm just derping on my pc when i catch a call that gets transferred over to me **me : ** help desk this is wonderweirdo **boss : ** hi wonderweirdo this is boss over at client i was told you got a call from crazy lady today and i wanted to hear from you what happened 
 i explain to him the gist of the conversation and that the recording should be available through my manager 
 **boss : ** i just wanted to let you know that crazy lady has been removed from the building 
 i have n't heard what she said to you yet but she made such a huge scene we had to bring the police in hr is taking care of the rest 
 **me : ** it 's not a problem i did n't think she was really going to come after me but it was obvious she was kind of <unk> there 
 **boss : ** yeah she 's in the hands of the police now she threatened a few more people around here 
 **me : ** she said she was firing you because you had her brothers car towed how was he involved did he work there too 
 **boss : ** no there 's been a mystery car parking in our lot for a couple weeks now 
 no one here seemed to own it i decided to have it towed from our lot since we do n't have enough space as it is 
 i think that she might have been allowing him to park there so he did n't have to pay for it else where and she just was n't reporting the car 
 **me : ** reporting the car 
 wait what did she do there 
 **boss : ** she was the security guard at the front desk 
 **me : ** are you serious 
 i hope she was n't armed 
 **boss : ** no but i 'm gon na call that agency about screening their people 
 **me : ** hold on how did a security guard at the front desk think she can just fire the owner of the company 
 **boss : ** i could hear him shrug over the phone i have no idea 
 **me : ** right 
 well if you need me to do anything else let me know but i 'm pretty sure the recording is on it 's way to you already 
 **boss : ** thanks i 'll be in touch 
 **update update update <unk> okay i 've done a little digging since i posted this 
 though this did n't make the news through certain online sources i was able to find the arrest record 
 i was tempted to post it but that could have lead to a violation of privacy i 'd have been on the hook for 
 this client is not in the same state as i am it 's all over the phone 
 i looked up the <unk> in the city where the client is and found her 
 even though she was <unk> for <unk> conduct and criminal threatening those charges were expanded to include <unk> of <unk> 
 which explains a great deal 
 my boss just got a new laptop and insists on complaining about everything about it ... <unk> 's different and therefore must be bad do n't ya know 
 he calls me into the office to complain that the mouse is <unk> '' 
 i use the mouse and it seems to be working perfectly 
 i take the mouse to my computer where it once again is working perfectly 
 so i wipe it down with a wet wipe and make it look as good as new 
 i put it in a random <unk> walk back into his office and act like i 'm installing a brand new mouse 
 a few minutes later ... me : how is it working for you now '' 
 him : much better thank you ... '' -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- edit : by popular <unk> a link to <unk> 's <unk> troubleshooting panel previous monday morning 
 slightly scared slightly confused slightly angry 
 i look at the ticket queue to calm down 
 & gt new ticket & gt my email isn’t working 
 <unk> email not working 
 how… vague 
 i open up the ticket and email the user 
 & gt hey hrsad it’s airz in it can you clarify what’s not working 
 about a minute later the phone rings its hrsad 
 & gt hrsad : awww hey 
 it’s me hrsad 
 & gt airz : oh umm normally people just reply by email but… i suppose that’s not working 
 i heard hrsad clicking on things i don’t really know what he was doing but it took him a while to reply 
 & gt hrsad : wha.. oh yeah i can receive but not send 
 can you come up and take a look 
 i can’t really explain 
 a walk might calm me down a little i thought 
 grabbing a coffee i walked to hr 
 upon arrival i was <unk> by hrsad who showed me his mac 
 it was the apple mail client it had a exclamation symbol next to one of his three mail accounts 
 & gt me : weird 
 it says you need to <unk> your password 
 the account was a yahoo account 
 & gt hrsad : ahh man 
 i dunno it 
 try penelope five that 's my normal password 
 now i’m as casual about passwords as the next it guy but this was said at full volume in an office 
 not even a whisper 
 i took a sip of my coffee to avoid <unk> 
 penelope5 as a password did not work 
 & gt me : nope 
 we’ll have to recover the account 
 & gt hrsad : oh no 
 actually hrsnooze was with me when i made the account… maybe <unk> know 
 hrsad woke his colleague 
 & gt hrsad : hey hrsnooze can you remember my password 
 for yahoo 
 & gt hrsnooze : wasn’t it like penelope five 
 at this point i realized security in hr was atrocious 
 & gt me : maybe we should recover the account and change it… to something new 
 & gt hrsnooze : yeah hrsad it’s probably time you changed your password from your <unk> <unk> hrsad looked oddly hurt by that comment 
 & gt me : lets just go through the security questions… 
 tears were forming 
 words were not 
 & gt me : errrr… 
 hello 
 blank face 
 a single tear rolled slowly down <unk> face 
 he didn’t even wipe it away 
 & gt me : whats your er… mothers madden name 
 still no wiping 
 the tear had hit the chin 
 it was threatening to drop 
 i tried to think of a way <unk> <unk> & gt me : you know what maybe we can recover your old password through keychain 
 i clicked onto the keychain icon and on yahoo email as the key i wanted to see 
 password prompt 
 i looked up at hrsad 
 he wasn’t saying a word 
 the single tear still threatened to drop 
 i thought about asking him this password ... not worth it i decided 
 <unk> i typed in 
 access granted 
 i saw the password for yahoo displayed in all its glory 
 <unk> f* $ % ing hr 
 next click here for something extra <unk> some of you may have read my last story here 
 well here 's another one 
 at this job i was on the internal helpdesk for a rather large company with over <unk> employees over roughly 30 sites 
 one morning i 'm at work it 's about <unk> i 'd just come back in from my morning smoke and coffee 
 i set my phone to <unk> and sit down 
 instantly my phone rings so i answer 
 & gt me : thanks for calling helpdesk this <unk> 
 how may i help you this morning '' 
 & gt customer : hi <unk> i hope i 've called the right place 
 i 've got a bit of an issue here ... '' & gt me : i 'm sure i can help mate what 's the issue '' 
 & gt customer : well it 's just this damn bike again '' 
 did he just say bike '' 
 again 
 he 's called before about this 
 & gt me : your ... bike you said '' 
 & gt customer : yeah the damn chain 's come off and i 've gotten my pant leg stuck in it '' 
 so i 'm more than slightly confused at this point 
 this has to be a joke right 
 & gt me : you want me to help you fix your bike 
 you are aware this is an *it* helpdesk not a <unk> helpdesk right '' 
 & gt customer : oh i thought you were here to help us with things '' 
 & gt me : yeah we are here to help you when your internet stops working or your printer explodes '' 
 there 's a moment of silence when eventually he sighs and asks me & gt customer : so ... you 're not going to help me '' 
 & gt me : *i 'm sure the exasperation in my voice was more apparent than i had <unk> ugh 
 i can help you 
 are you in $ town '' 
 & gt customer : *he sounds absolutely <unk> oh really 
 great 
 i am in $ town just around the corner from $ building 
 i ca n't get up to walk to the office '' 
 & gt me : okay do n't go anywhere lol i 'll be there in 5 minutes '' 
 & gt customer : oh god you 're a <unk> kid '' 
 i go around to the car park where he is and it turns out he was an executive on the board 
 needless to say i helped him up put his chain back on his bike for him and sent him on his merry way 
 he explained to the ceo about why he was late and he mentioned that i helped him even though his bike <unk> a motherboard 
 the ceo personally came to shake my hand and gave me a voucher for a free lunch at the bar in town 
 i really did love that <unk> time <unk> all the tales 
 this is one of mine although i was n't working in a tech support '' role i think it will fit : a few years ago i was on the <unk> team for a $ 275 million dollar <unk> to a large <unk> plant 
 the place was a <unk> with operations continuing in older parts of the plant while new parts were being brought online and contractors operations crew and head office '' <unk> people working <unk> each other 
 being a modern facility the majority of the pumps and there were over 100 were <unk> driven with speed control by <unk> frequency drive <unk> 
 all of these <unk> were tied into the internal control systems and were networked devices 
 consequently in the motor control centre mcc where these <unk> were two network racks 
 one sunday afternoon i was in the control room keeping things running <unk> when all 9 screens in front of me <unk> out then returned with all the icons greyed out 
 outside in the plant i hear the sounds of every motor <unk> down ... causing all sorts of <unk> 
 high level alarms low level alarms temperature alarms <unk> alarms <unk> alarms you get the picture 
 i ca n't restart anything from the <unk> <unk> interface ie : computer so i <unk> down to the mcc and all the <unk> are reading offline 
 i reset one and it comes back up 
 i then manually reset all of them and start bringing things back up 
 6 hours later we 're back running 
 i mention this to management and they say that the electricians <unk> and it crews will look into it 
 next set i 'm on days and it happens <unk> once each day 
 i 'm told that nothing was found and they 're looking for a software glitch 
 after that i 'm back on nights and all is quiet 
 this continues for a few weeks and a pattern starts to <unk> 
 the <unk> failures are only happening during the day specifically when anyone is working in or near the mcc or the cable trays leading <unk> it 
 i bring this up and am told nope we 're sure it 's software '' 
 fast forward to 2 weeks later i 'm coming back from vacation talking to the guy i 'm <unk> 
 on his way out he casually mentions that they 've solved the <unk> 's been stable for a week 
 turned out it was a badly terminated cat6 in one of the racks ... being <unk> by the other cables being moved : edit : wow 
 thanks for the upvotes ... i 'll see what else is lurking in my brain that might be of interest : previous heads of department meetings are always late in the day 
 the dread of their arrival <unk> even the best of mornings 
 i get seated in my usual spot the new secretary walks in 
 & gt sec : anyone for tea 
 & gt me : coffee please 
 & gt sec : sorry i ca n't serve coffee in here any more 
 tea 
 & gt me : but you make such nice coffee 
 & gt sec : boss 's orders i 'm afraid 
 the vp walks into the room he 's looking pleased with himself 
 probably put his shoes on the right feet this morning 
 & gt me : vp why is no coffee allowed in here 
 & gt vp : oh the smell 
 i 'm afraid the new security manager is allergic to the coffee smell 
 & gt me : allergic 
 that ... does n't sound possible 
 & gt hsec : i 'm afraid it 's true 
 every time i smell coffee i get bad <unk> 
 & gt me : i had coffee the other day you seemed fine 
 & gt hsec : oh ... no it was horrible 
 & gt vp : we ca n't be making our head of security feeling uncomfortable can we 
 anyway on with the meeting first up airz 
 i was starting to tune out something i 'd gotten used to in heads of department meetings of late 
 the mention of my name startled me awake 
 & gt me : <unk> what 
 & gt vp : we 'll need the budget for security 
 so it can be passed onto hsec 
 & gt me : there 's no budget 
 i just pulled money from it since i was managing both 
 & gt vp : well ... we 'll have to pull the costs from the last few months so hsec knows what funds he has to work with 
 the vp looked down at his meeting notes 
 it was a blank page 
 the vp 's grin was wide 
 & gt vp : also airz the christmas party is coming up 
 as you know every year one of our departments gets to host the event 
 & gt me : oh is it my turn already 
 & gt vp : yep you 'll get to plan the entire thing with our events co-ordinator 
 & gt me : great ... i looked over at the coffee machine 
 it was turned off at the wall 
 head of hr was sitting next to me she 'd been much nicer since i 'd upgraded all of hr 's computers 
 she tapped me out of dreaming for coffee and whispered in my ear 
 & gt headhr : do n't worry i had christmas last year 
 the events co-ordinator will do everything just pass it all off 
 & gt me : good to know ... i looked back over at the coffee machine 
 at least it was n't being abused 
 it had no power though 
 after the meeting had ended hsec caught up to me in the corridor 
 & gt hsec : airz 
 before the official numbers arrive i 'd like to know about how much money i 'll have for upgrades etc 
 & gt me : upgrades to ... security 
 & gt hsec : yeah usual stuff 
 a few more cameras a security car maybe a few more guards 
 & gt me : a car 
 that 's <unk> since we do n't have any <unk> between our buildings 
 & gt hsec : yes but what if we had an offsite emergency 
 & gt me : call the police 
 we do n't have to secure the world 
 & gt hsec : we need to be prepared for all possibilities 
 that 's why i need to know about what <unk> i 'll get 
 & gt me : hopefully probably something around the <unk> mark for new expenses 
 & gt hsec : oh that 'll be plenty for the first month 
 & gt me : errr ... that was for the year 
 & gt hsec : hahaha good security means less losses elsewhere 
 & gt me : well hopefully the vp can get you your money to ... <unk> losses 
 & gt hsec : oh 
 i thought it was coming from your budget 
 & gt me : hahaha now you 're just being silly 
 i felt a trickle of fear 
 just a trickle 
 next i 've been meaning to post this one for a while now 
 i work in the tech support department for a small software company 
 i got a call a few months back that went a little something like this : me : good afternoon software tech support 
 this is <unk> '' 
 customer : hi something is really messed up 
 i 'm getting an error message and i ca n't get anything to load in software '' 
 me : ok. what does the message say '' 
 the message is something that i 've never seen before and it does not sound good 
 me : ok. let me connect in with you and i 'll take a closer look '' 
 i connect to his pc and i see the message sitting there 
 i start to poke around 
 me : when did you start seeing this message 
 i 've never seen this before '' 
 customer : well it really was n't working right so i kind of freaked out and started deleting stuff '' 
 no i am not <unk> 
 that sentence definitely came out of his mouth 
 it actually took a few seconds for me to process what he said and start speaking again 
 me : ... you started deleting stuff '' 
 customer : yeah '' 
 i dive into the folder structure to look for the database files required to run any project in this program and assess the damage 
 nothing 
 no files at all 
 dear god 
 i immediately head to his recycle bin and see a whole hell of a lot of important files pop up 
 whew 
 me : well it looks like the files you deleted are still all in the recycle bin 
 there 's a lot of stuff in here and i do n't want to try and sort out exactly what needs to be restored and accidentally miss something so i 'm just going to restore everything 
 is that ok '' 
 customer : yeah that 's fine '' 
 i restore everything 
 the files are all back where they belong 
 i launch the program and everything works the way it should 
 i probably fixed a few other things on his computer as well considering his troubleshooting steps appear to start with kill it with fire 
 tl dr guy has a software problem and decides the solution is to freak out and start deleting stuff '' 
 i experienced first hand almost word for word 
 <unk> my mother through some fairly complex ideas regarding ocr of some pdfs of scanned text she 's <unk> and correcting 
 basically she has scans of books which the ocr has totally failed to read properly because all ocr sucks and then she <unk> the text it produces or <unk> the formatting in word 
 so far so good 
 she 's been working with computers at home and at work for & gt 25 years so this is n't beyond her capacity 
 i ask her what sort of file size the pdfs are in case it 's feasible to bulk copy a large number of them to my laptop and maybe do some cleanup of the scans so the ocr has more of a chance of not sucking 
 this is the good bit 
 she opens a pdf in word using the previous documents '' menu opens the insert image '' menu navigates to where she keeps the pdfs within her folder structure right clicks a pdf properties ... and reads me the file size 
 i 'm not sure whether to be shocked or surprised laughing or <unk> 
 she 's using the file select menus in word as a file browser 
 my mother has used the windows operating system since early win <unk> era and has no idea what explorer is for 
 on further questioning she refused to accept that her method is n't just as valid as my idea of <unk> a folder using a program specifically designed for the <unk> and was pretty certain that using menus in word was actually better as it does n't involve navigating to another program so this method is much faster 
 what 's worse is that she may be <unk> i 've just taken a call regarding poor wireless signal from a customer 
 & gt me : so what seems to be the problem with your wireless 
 & gt user : well it works when we 're in the same room as the router but as soon as we go outside it drops 
 what are you going to do about it 
 your router is faulty 
 & gt me : ok as it 's wireless there are a lot of factors that can cause issues with the signal 
 could you describe the room that your router is kept in please 
 & gt user : well we 're in a converted bank 
 the computer stuff is kept in the vault 
 & gt me : well that 's probably the issue the walls are most likely reinforced and are so thick that you ca n't get a signal through them 
 & gt user : *after a minor bout of swearing at me* well what are you going to do about it 
 i want to cancel since you ca n't provide a service etc etc ... she eventually hung up on me still not believing that 4 foot thick <unk> reinforced concrete walls may be the problem 
 tl dr wireless wo n't work in a with a router in a bank vault also edit : <unk> long time lurker first post sentence 
 many <unk> ago i started my tech career for a big box technology retailer $ bbr in the us which had just recently acquired a small technology support company $ tsc 
 during my tenure with $ tsc i <unk> many stories ranging from comical to downright depressing 
 if this short is received well i may begin to recount some of the more memorable ones 
 this one is about an older gentleman $ cust who was likely making his first computer purchase ever 
 i worked for a store very near to one of the largest retirement <unk> in the state 
 & gt geeks : thank you for calling $ tsc this is <unk> how can i help you 
 & gt cust : hi i just purchased a new computer from $ bbr and had you guys do your thing to set it up 
 i got it home and have been using it for a few hours 
 everything was working great i went to get some dinner came back and the damned thing wo n't turn on 
 & gt geeks : i 'm sorry to hear that sir 
 could you please give me your phone number so i can look up your purchase 
 pull up customer 's purchase in computer system 
 & gt geeks : i see you purchased a $ mfg laptop is this correct 
 & gt cust : yes 
 & gt geeks : great 
 thank you 
 let 's start with the basics when you got home did you remove the laptop and power cord from the box 
 & gt cust : just the laptop it 's wireless so it does n't need a power cord 
 <unk> did i hear that correctly 
 & gt geeks : sir could you please check the box underneath a small cardboard flap there should be a power cord 
 & gt cust : i 'll look but your salesman said it was wireless 
 & gt geeks : yes sir it is 
 may i ask you a question 
 do you have a cell phone sir 
 & gt cust : yes 
 & gt geeks : is it wireless 
 & gt cust : ah i get what you 're saying 
 i have the power cord and will plug it in for a while 
 how long does it take to charge 
 & gt geeks : about 4 hours sir 
 previous i walked into it the next morning feeling good even our night owl of staff were happy 
 & gt owl : really quiet last <unk> & gt me : haha this competition has made tickets pretty <unk> 
 & gt owl : nah nah <unk> then that 
 it was amazing 
 he gave me a broad smile and left for home 
 i’d never seen him so cheery maybe i just never saw it before 
 new perspective on life 
 i sat down with a coffee and looked down at the ticket queue 
 zero tickets 
 perfect 
 maybe the positive vibes i’m generating is causing everything to go well for once 
 two <unk> zero tickets later i hear a knock at the door 
 it was solitaire he didn’t look happy 
 didn’t matter i’d soon cheer him up 
 & gt sol : we have a <unk> & gt me : don’t be silly everything is good 
 come in take a seat 
 i’ll grab us some coffees 
 positive vibes out into the universe positive vibes would return 
 & gt sol : no no 
 airz 
 listen we have a serious problem 
 & gt me : okay 
 whats wrong 
 positive vibes were on the way 
 just got ta wait for it 
 & gt sol : don’t get mad 
 i waited again for something positive to return 
 solitaire took it as a sign to continue 
 & gt sol : so ummm remember when itsec explained to you about his 30 second chance before all the tickets got <unk> to the main queue 
 & gt me : <unk> something <unk> <unk> was slowly <unk> back 
 & gt sol : well i ummm set up my own account… like that 
 so i could have first pick of the tickets 
 & gt me : oh 
 so you want to be <unk> from the competition like itsec 
 maybe this was good 
 <unk> might just work 
 & gt sol : well no 
 see i was logging onto the same system and taking tickets just like itsec 
 i was only doing it because … actually that doesn’t matter 
 & gt me : so you’ve been <unk> tickets before they hit the main queue 
 & gt sol : yes but when you changed the <unk> rules it broke the account because that account could no longer drop the tickets back into the queue 
 oh hell 
 hello <unk> my old friend 
 & gt me : sooo… & gt sol : so since whenever you changed the rules till now that account has taken every ticket and errors when it tries to put them back in the queue 
 i picked up my coffee 
 i didn’t even sip it 
 just held it 
 & gt me : how <unk> 
 & gt sol : how many tickets has it got 
 quite a few 
 some of the tickets are nearing the 18 hour mark <unk> 
 & gt me : no 
 how many times should i fire you 
 i looked over at my computer 
 **new email** & gt <unk> the hell are you doing down in it 
 peoples tickets are sitting with no fix 
 * — the vp oh so the vp knows 
 perfect 
 ***** next had a lady burst into our office yesterday 
 lady : there are red crosses over everything '' 
 me : erm ok. can you please tell us what you were doing when it went wrong '' 
 lady : i do n't know there are red crosses over everything '' me : so we can help i need to know what happened what were you doing when the red crosses came up '' 
 lady : look i 've not got time to explain i need a f***ing computer '' she is known for swearing at this point she <unk> it out of the office swearing going on about finding another f***ing computer 
 i went upstairs and looked at her machine 
 clear as day no logon servers are available ... '' this had one very small red cross in the top right to close the dialogue box 
 i plugged the network cable in that she 'd somehow managed to pull out and it worked fine 
 i hate the blind panic come and rescue me approach she used 
 if she would have just read what it said and phoned us she could have resolved it herself instantly or i would have popped up 
 instead she went wandering around trying to find a computer did n't and then <unk> at us for not having fixing her machine 
 we already had and she did n't <unk> for having a go without even testing it before kicking off for the second time 
 i 'm really tempted to put in a complaint about her swearing and general attitude 
 previous tuesday afternoon 
 i was two slides into my it security talk and already my patience was wearing very thin 
 i was death staring “thatguy” to sit down while he searched room for a pen with a “what are going to do about it” smile 
 luckily the room was saved from badcop by the vp’s secretary who’d walked into the room carrying a coffee 
 & gt vpsec : oh 
 am i late 
 sorry 
 vpsec handed me the coffee and took a seat at the front 
 silence reigned around the room as i waited for “thatguy” to sit 
 he was oblivious to the room waiting for him 
 i took a sip of delicious coffee while waiting for “thatguy” 
 the vp’s secretary looked increasingly uncomfortable 
 eventually she looked around the room to see what i was waiting on 
 & gt vpsec : **you** 
 sit down so we can start 
 coffee had dissolved my bad mood 
 so a smile broke out as “thatguy” sheepishly took a seat after being told off be vpsec 
 & gt me : it staff will never email you for your password 
 if you get an email asking for your password from it or anyone 
 do not reply 
 contact it immediately 
 most of the room was nodding 
 one hand however had again shot into the air 
 i took another sip of coffee and ignored it 
 next slide 
 & gt thatguy : what if its an email from your manager 
 & gt me : i’ll answer questions at the end 
 okay <unk> 
 i was cut off 
 & gt thatguy : what if it asks for your password 
 you said don’t reply just contact it 
 but thats replying though… 
 i couldn’t believe it 
 basic instructions failed this guy 
 badcop was screaming 
 i tried to drown badcop in coffee by taking a long sip 
 & gt vpsec : does this look like the end of the talk to you 
 & gt thatguy : oh i’m *really* sorry… 
 i’m just confused 
 the <unk> mood shifted 
 thatguy had been told off by a member of the <unk> 
 & gt me : if you receive an email with just a link check with the sender that the link is legitimate 
 if it has not been sent by them please contact it 
 & gt thatguy : check via reply email or call them 
 murmurs of <unk> <unk> and oh my goodness <unk> throughout the audience 
 an old guy at the back with a orange tie spoke up 
 & gt orangetie : questions at the end 
 geez 
 & gt thatguy : oh 
 right 
 questions at the end 
 sorry 
 i thought since it was a short one… we could just quickly get it done now 
 orangetie stared “thatguy” down with a scary face 
 i decided to continue after sipping coffee 
 & gt me : emails with <unk> attachments should not be opened 
 if the attachment is an .exe or zip file especially do not download it 
 also scan all attachments before downloading 
 <unk> hand was in the air 
 however the entire room was just staring him down 
 he decided not to speak up 
 & gt me : passwords should be different for every single account you have 
 avoid using the same password twice 
 & gt thatguy : i read an article that said using the same password in everything as long as its secure and only you know it is okay… the room went silent 
 orangetie looked livid 
 looking around “thatguy” tried to justify himself 
 & gt thatguy : it’s not <unk> a question ... & gt orangetie : shut 
 up 
 thatguy mouthed sorry again to the room and <unk> his hand as a vague peace symbol 
 i took a sip of my coffee 
 empty 
 huh oh 
 & gt me : thatguy is <unk> always use different passwords for every account 
 anyway <unk> & gt thatguy : but ... i had no coffee left to keep badcop <unk> 
 next previous control <unk> 
 i <unk> to my empty cup 
 & gt thatguy : but why not just have one password that 's secure 
 & gt me : please… 
 please 
 either leave your questions till the end or just leave 
 i was breathing heavily i <unk> not to just scream at the guy 
 & gt thatguy : i’ll wait 
 thatguy gave me a smile 
 i couldn’t tell what type i was busy trying not to throw something at him 
 & gt me : if you suspect someone was watching you type in your password change it immediately 
 everyone in the room turned to look thatguy 
 he sat 
 no questions 
 & gt me : if your computer starts getting popups or is <unk> slow without any programs open 
 contact it we’re always happy to take a look even if it turns out nothing is wrong 
 & gt thatguy : is it question time now 
 i was in shock 
 he was incapable of not talking 
 thatguy looked around the room at the angry faces 
 he felt the need to explain himself 
 & gt thatguy : airz is talking about preventative maintenance usually the last topic to be covered 
 so its question time now… 
 right 
 i tried to take a deep breath 
 & gt me : no 
 i’m afraid for you question time will never come 
 get out 
 & gt thatguy : but i’ve got so many questions… 
 & gt me : okay you can come down to it tomorrow and we’ll have a one on one session 
 i’ll answer all your questions 
 & gt thatguy : sounds good 
 thatguy was smiling widely 
 however he remained seated 
 i waited 
 & gt me : ahem 
 please leave 
 i gestured over to the door 
 whilst looking directly at thatguy 
 & gt thatguy : i think i’m going to <unk> <unk> % it 
 badcop time 
 & gt me : **no** you should leave 
 now 
 & gt thatguy : i won’t ask any more questions 
 i was pissed 
 the room was <unk> & gt me : get the <unk> $ % k out 
 i’ll see you tomorrow and we can review the material then 
 & gt thatguy : i won’t say a single word unless you 're wrong about something 
 breaking point 
 & gt me : you’re wasting <unk> time 
 not only are you a major security risk with your <unk> password” strategy but you have the most <unk> questions i’ve ever heard 
 now unless you get up off your chair and walk out that door right now i’ll make sure that your remaining time at this company is <unk> small 
 & gt thatguy : what 
 i look a deep breath and tried not to scream 
 luckily orangetie spoke up before i did 
 & gt orangetie : airz said if you don’t leave he’ll make sure you’re fired 
 thatguy jumped up and walked out the door 
 upon reaching it he turned and smiled at me 
 & gt thatguy : see you tomorrow 
 walking away the entire room started whispering looking nervously up at me 
 were they afraid 
 & gt vpsec : f* % # that guy 
 nervous laughter broke out across the room 
 i weakly smiled 
 i continued with my talk 
 it was good 
 next monday came to see the fruition of my power move 
 facilities were present and correct at the it cupboard busy fitting brand new desks and <unk> 
 on completion mafg and i replaced the ghost server in its rightful setting on top of a <unk> comms cabinet as though a rightful leader was being returned to the throne 
 there was n't much time for <unk> as there was a massive <unk> of builds to get through and only a week left until possibly the largest induction session i 'd ever run 
 our birmingham satellite office had a <unk> drive and were <unk> down 40 delegates the following monday for new gear and it training 
 it felt good like we were back in business 
 i expected some sort of a backlash from angie 
 obviously i had caught her <unk> and she needed time to regroup and plan her strategy 
 all i could do was wait for the strike 
 but for now we all <unk> in our little victory 
 several laptops were busy building on the build desk as i clicked away making some new ad accounts for my incoming party of inductees 
 having received <unk> previously from bhit to replace the missing desktops facilities managed to lose with brand new machines i had them all loaded on a trolley ready to roll them out 
 mafg was <unk> himself with an inventory of mini keyboards and mice taking stock for an urgent purchase order 
 we chatted casually as he made his way up and down the <unk> it was a <unk> <unk> of progress 
 our <unk> <unk> stopped dead like a body dropping in the middle of a busy street 
 the electronic lock <unk> and the door opened angie 's familiar <unk> of coffee and old woman <unk> <unk> her appearance in the doorway her scowling face writing a thousand words of bitterness as she surveyed our <unk> cave of tech 
 she said nothing <unk> my eyes as i looked expectantly for a few seconds as i greeted her with a good morning '' 
 expecting some request 
 after a few seconds of uncomfortable silence i ignored her again and placed my tickets sheet on top of the trolley and started to wheel out 
 just a minute '' 
 she said <unk> a single <unk> finger in my direction her tongue <unk> against the top of her dry mouth 
 what are you up to in here now '' 
 a rather curious question i would wager one which i would have thought obvious 
 after explaining the current <unk> on little did i know i was jumping <unk> into her trap 
 it had been barely a morning gone when she had already planned her <unk> to the letter 
 this was the <unk> mission this is where she would <unk> the roots of her plot 
 she came straight out with it : where are the tickets for these 40 laptops you 're supposedly building '' 
 supposedly building 
 tickets for induction users 
 never heard of such a thing 
 mafg appeared from behind the racking as if to leap to my defense 
 we generally do n't log them for inductions 
 we usually get a fair number of requests for new machines so we just use an ad container to build the machine and move them to live when we 're rolling them out '' 
 shit ... mafg really knows how to put his foot in it sometimes ... what is ad '' 
 angie demanded 
 i could feel the life force <unk> out of me as angie realized yet another scope for micromanagement 
 why do n't i have access to it '' 
 her stern face looking like we had <unk> her out of some mythical prize the lines on her forehead <unk> together 
 realizing his mistake mafg kept quiet as i tried to work around it 
 we do n't generally hand out that sort of access out 
 if someone did n't know what they were doing they could cause a lot of damage and the potential mess that can occur 
 only mafg and i have access to it in 2nd line as we 're the only ones who administer accounts '' 
 ok it was n't the best <unk> i could have said but there it 's been said now 
 angie threw around some more <unk> <unk> before taking her leave 
 she also left me in no uncertain terms that she expected to see active tickets for each and every machine i was building for inductees before the end of the day 
 an hour out of my life for no purpose 
 sigh ... angie 's final email that day made her feelings on the it cupboard clear no engineer was to be in the cupboard without a ticket <unk> their need to be in there and not without the express permission of angie first 
 another <unk> trait of angie 's hardline stance against <unk> : control a person 's ability to conduct themselves and create the <unk> of importance by demanding constant permission seeking 
 the clever bitch had laid the <unk> for her new play there was a new ball to throw out on to the court 
 tickets for every machine permission from angie to use the it cupboard 
 and what would she do with her <unk> knowledge of ad 's existence 
 i contemplated these things as i drove home sat in the traffic jam from hell 
 as i drew up on the accident the <unk> of other <unk> <unk> at the <unk> <unk> which littered the inside lane of the <unk> seemed to exemplify the <unk> of each day 's passing as <unk> <unk> around the <unk> <unk> <unk> the mass of metal as if finally <unk> a once <unk> <unk> 
 as i passed the scene sure enough the traffic started moving at it 's prescribed <unk> over the speed limit 
 it was as if we had all just escaped some fatal consequence and were now running away for dear life 
 for me tomorrow was another day another opportunity to dance in this <unk> struggle <unk> and <unk> through the actions of this <unk> character whose aroma seemed to <unk> even the most jovial memory

 i contemplated what i’d done in life to deserve this on the one hand i was <unk> wet and getting cold in an office with everyone too busy to talk to me 
 on the other hand i was getting paid stupid money for literally no work 
 my mind ran in <unk> <unk> whether this place was a curse or a <unk> 
 carefree eventually saw me <unk> in clothes that couldn’t be more wet 
 & gt carefree : airz i got you this 
 carefree held up a jumpsuit it was bright orange 
 he handed it to me 
 i put on the jumpsuit and smiled to myself 
 without the cold and with someone at least partially talking to me this place wasn’t too bad 
 i left the bathroom and found carefree waiting for me 
 & gt carefree : oh <unk> doesn’t really suit you 
 he smiled at me 
 i looked down at the jumpsuit then smiled back 
 & gt me : its <unk> 
 that 's all that matters 
 & gt carefree : now you’re wearing clothes that can get a little dirty could you do me a favor 
 & gt me : haha sending me to do your dirty work 
 i was bored enough i’d literally jump at an opportunity to do something 
 & gt carefree : haha okay we’ve got the network cupboard right 
 we walked over to the network cupboard i was expecting <unk> 
 it was unexpectedly really tidy 
 & gt carefree : see this switch well i want to know where these wires connect too 
 & gt me : sure thing 
 i followed the switch cords they all lead to the patch panel above the patch panel had labels 
 empty labels 
 & gt me : errr 
 okay it seems someone hasn’t filled in the labels when they installed the patch panel 
 & gt carefree : yeah… so how do you work out where they go 
 i looked at the back of the patch panel all the cords went straight into the roof 
 & gt me : simple just find all the ports on walls in the office then unplug everything one by one 
 process of <unk> really 
 & gt carefree : sorry you misunderstand there are these ten cables in this switch that go into the roof and end near rooms but never got put into actual points 
 i want to know where in the wall those cords are so we can cut into the wall and put in the wall plate thingy 
 i realized pretty soon that he wanted me to go into the roof cavity and chase cords 
 & gt me : haha its probably quicker to just unplug them and lay new cords 
 & gt carefree : mmm they’re already up there though 
 just got ta find about where in the walls 
 i looked up at the roof tiles 
 i decided i should at least look at the roof cavity 
 i pushed up one of the roof tiles 
 each of the roof tiles was held up by a metal structure that was tied to the <unk> slab above 
 the cavity was actually quite big about a meter and a half tall 
 & gt me : mmm i can’t actually see where those cords go specially 
 carefree said he’d leave me too it 
 i went to the nearest phone and called the tech that was on vacation 
 & gt tech : hey airz did you get the isp to come and fix the internet 
 i realized i never updated him on that situation 
 didn’t matter 
 & gt me : oh… yeah 
 hey off topic the cat5 that goes into the roof any chance you know where those cords go 
 & gt tech : hahaha carefree wants to put in the ports for the wall huh 
 & gt me : yeah something like that 
 & gt tech : has he tried to get you to wear the orange jumpsuit yet 
 i looked down at my orange <unk> did he plan this… & gt me : actually i’m already wearing them 
 & gt tech : haha rookie error 
 he’d never make you actually go into the roof in you own clothes 
 now you’ll have to go into the roof 
 & gt me : that metal frame holding up the roof tiles will never support my weight 
 & gt tech : oh what ever you do… don’t step on the roof tiles just walk on tops of the walls i’ve been up there a few times the walls can support you 
 & gt me : errr… 
 & gt tech : just remember 
 don’t step on the roof tiles they can’t take any weight at all 
 i hung up the phone 
 resigned myself to my fate of climbing in the roof 
 i thought about being bored this was the opposite of that 
 i didn’t know which was better 
 at least i was warm 
 i set a ladder against the wall next to the switch 
 i grabbed some masking tape a <unk> pen some paper and prepared myself 
 carefree caught me half way up the ladder as i was marking in the roof which cords needed to be found 
 i put a little masking tape tag on the ones that i needed to follow 
 & gt carefree : all ready to go up 
 i just got a call from our tech 
 he said to remember just walk on the walls 
 & gt me : yep… i better get started 
 i got myself into the roof cavity and balanced myself on the wall below me 
 i started following cables 
 first cable i followed dropped down between two walls 
 i realized i had no idea where i was 
 i cracked open a roof tile next to me and looked down at the office below 
 it was one of the meeting rooms i figured i’d have to get fairly close to the cable to find it in the cavity 
 so i opened up the roof tile some more and places some tape on the wall exactly where the cable dropped down 
 second cable i followed it ended in an office 
 its occupant looked rather confused about a man in the roof marking the wall with masking tape 
 oddly he still didn’t say a single thing about it 
 third cable i followed it opened up the tile in the roof and looked down at the room below 
 the red haired lady looked up from her desk straight at me 
 i realized at this point i was in the roof opening a tile into a room i’d just been <unk> told to <unk> 
 <unk> from 
 i waited for the scream ... next hello tfts 
 it has been a while since i posted 
 i hope this new tale from the <unk> tech will <unk> you all 
 ***** there i was minding my own business when i got the call 
 & gt cx - hello 
 is this <unk> 
 & gt me - yes 
 what 's up 
 & gt cx - my laptop caught fire when i was trying to overclock the bluray player 
 can you recover my files 
 <unk> explodes at this <unk> & gt me - wait what 
 say that again 
 i wanted to make sure i was n't <unk> what was being said 
 & gt cx - my bluray player was skipping and lagging so i tried to overclock it 
 & gt me - *sigh* ok wait a moment 
 before we even get to file recovery i just have to know how 
 & gt cx - i looked up a <unk> guide on google and found where the power leads on my bluray drive in my laptop were because i remembered that you told me that it takes a little extra power when overclocking to make things faster 
 so i carefully soldered in extra power from an old power-adapter i had laying around that was n't being used 
 & gt me - wait wait wait 
 you did what 
 you said it caught fire 
 how did it catch fire 
 & gt cx - well i was watching a movie when it started <unk> and <unk> down again 
 i plugged in the power-adapter while the movie was running thinking it would speed it up and boy did it 
 it sounded like a little drill and then i heard a <unk> sound and started smelling smoke 
 i opened up the drive and my disc had shattered and smoke started pouring out 
 it got really hot then i saw a small <unk> coming out from my keyboard 
 i unplugged it really fast and then dumped it in the bathtub to put it out 
 at this point all i could do was sit there listening over the phone to this description get worse and worse 
 i truly knew that nothing i would do could fix this situation as i expected the hdd in the laptop to be ruined 
 after getting the details and getting the laptop delivered it was even worse than expected 
 there was a wire hanging out from the bluray drive thus confirming at least that part of the story 
 there were still pieces of <unk> bluray plastic here and there 
 the keyboard was burned but not completely melted through 
 i managed to get into the laptop without destroying things worse and found what i thought - though not quite the way i thought it 
 i called up the customer to give them the bad news : & gt me - sorry to let you know but i ca n't recover anything 
 if there was sensitive information that you truly need you can take the drive to a <unk> site but it will be pretty expensive 
 & gt cx - why ca n't you get it 
 you got it before when the drive would n't even spin 
 & gt me - that is because there is a 1 time trick you can use to make a locked up drive spin again until you turn it off 
 it wo n't ever work after that 
 i ca n't fix this 
 this is beyond sticking a hard drive in a freezer for a couple of hours 
 your drive connector melted off 
 i ca n't connect it to any of my equipment so i ca n't retrieve the data 
 overclocking '' your bluray drive destroyed your harddrive 
 i 'm sorry 
 & gt cx - oh well 
 nothing too important was on that drive 
 guess next time i 'll ask for help before overclocking the drive 
 maybe you could overclock it properly next time 
 *mental <unk> first job was at a <unk> style not really it had ~50 employees but it was run that badly coding body shop 
 people brought ideas and money to us and we 'd turn them into programs or websites or they 'd bring us the code that some other company or relative had <unk> <unk> <unk> and we 'd try to make it actually work 
 i spent 8 years there which in <unk> was about 7 years too many - here 's one of the first experiences that should 've been my cue to leave ... this particular story occurs <unk> months after i began working there 
 even though i was a newbie i 'd proven i knew what i was doing so i got moved onto a more challenging project 
 challenging '' is probably not the right way to describe it a horrible mess '' would be more accurate 
 this was a <unk> 7 application that had been <unk> together by various companies before us that should have been the first warning - the end result was that something which should have been simple like adding a <unk> menu no functionality to the main window took an entire day 
 the ide crashed a lot because of the weird things the project was doing 
 but i would 've been fine if it were n't for the client 
 this client was very ... <unk> on his application 's success 
 he was convinced that the issues he 'd had with previous companies were entirely their fault 
 to ensure that his <unk> <unk> were implemented to his satisfaction he would come and sit with us devs while we coded the feature 
 as in he would watch us and tell us what we were doing wrong and complain we were being slow and talk on his cellphone and type on his laptop 
 basically our office was his office ... and our management were okay with this because he <unk> <unk> had signed a contract saying he would pay a lot of money 
 of course us devs did n't have any say in this matter but we eventually adjusted to the new normal 
 now my standard morning routine is probably very similar to yours in that i do n't start work the moment i walk in the door i spend my first 15 minutes to an hour checking my email and some websites news and webcomics 
 there was a <unk> from management not to use the internet too much because we had a data cap another story for another time but generally just after you 'd arrived or just before you were gon na leave was seen as okay 
 on one particular morning this client arrived early while i was still reading webcomics 
 i did n't know he was there because i was listening to music and i did n't know he had sat in silence watching me read webcomics for maybe 5 minutes before he went to complain to management 
 the first i knew about it was when i was called into the financial manager 's office and chewed out for wasting the client 's time '' and being dishonest '' 
 the reason for this was the fact that clients were billed not hourly but in <unk> intervals 
 every day us devs were expected to <unk> our working time <unk> and precisely into an application that was used to bill the customers at the end of the month 
 that took all the responsibility for billing off management and placed it on the devs 
 it also meant that clients could see a detailed breakdown of what us devs had allegedly been doing 
 this client made the accusation that because i was n't working for 5 minutes i was obviously billing him for the time and therefore the company was in breach of contract 
 the financial manager who chewed me out for this - without asking me for the facts beforehand - was one of the most useless <unk> i 've ever had the displeasure of working with 
 he was also a <unk> crazy hollow moon lizard people conspiracy <unk> 
 this may or may not have something to do with the fact that the company was rarely more than barely <unk> 
 he consistently took clients sides against us devs because he could n't say no '' to the guys paying the bills 
 he wanted to fire me for upsetting the client and lying '' but fortunately <unk> heads <unk> and i was kept on although quickly transferred to another project 
 this incident was a <unk> point in the company 's relationship with this client there were a lot of other things going on behind the scenes that i had no knowledge of 
 the end result was that a decision was taken to fire the client but before this could be done he sued my employer 
 they settled out of court for what i later found out was about 5 years worth of my salary at the time 
 what did the client do next 
 found another unsuspecting software company ended up suing them for a far larger amount and won 
 we later found out that suing was this client 's <unk> <unk> : he would pick a small software company promise them buckets of cash get them to sign a very specific contract dump his crappy code on them then <unk> to ensure that they <unk> their contract and get his money back and more 
 it seems that in my case he decided that sooner was better than later which was <unk> because if he had waited until we inevitably missed a deadline he would 've been able to sue for a far larger amount than my employer have been able to afford 
 and he almost certainly would 've won because i <unk> in a country where at the time laws still had to be written to cater for software 
 tl dr i got my employer sued by pissing off a client turned out that i actually helped the company dodge a much larger lawsuit hence the company <unk> attempts at <unk> moral support from my girlfriend had failed 
 after recounting the day 's events she thought my <unk> was simply the male <unk> in me speaking out against a woman who was just struggling in a man 's world and in her eyes doing it well 
 arriving for work i had three video conferences to get set up planned for exactly the same start times 
 after working diligently to get them set up i finally set off for the ground floor the home of it support 
 this time having grown smart of angie 's <unk> for anyone drinking coffee i swung by the kitchen first 
 oh yes angie 's still on form today 
 i sit at my desk and fire up my machine 
 angie glares at me whatever i 'm learning to ignore it 
 anything to say '' 
 she <unk> 
 ok i was n't quite expecting it to be that <unk> ... 
 no '' 
 came my reply accompanied with my best what 's going on <unk> then '' look 
 off we go to her meeting room which appears to have become her favorite place to dress down her troops 
 half expecting an array of torture weapons to now <unk> the walls she slammed the door behind us 
 why were you late '' 
 she demanded 
 confused i informed her i was n't late i was in fact 15 minutes early 
 i had arrived at <unk> to get the video conferences set up for 9:00 despite the fact that my shift was n't actually due to start till 9:00 anyway 
 however due to a slight technical issue whereby sound from the american side of the video conference had failed i was working with a <unk> to resolve the issue thus arriving at my desk at <unk> i 'm sure you can imagine how well my explanation was received 
 i may as well have made up a story about having to perform a few impromptu acts of <unk> <unk> after some had escaped from the zoo and found their way into the building <unk> me for 20 minutes 
 it would have been just as well listened to 
 she then proceeded to have me calculate with her on the white board that if i was 20 minutes late every day how much i would effectively cost the company over the course of a year which worked out to approximately 12 working days 
 she then demanded to know why i felt it was ok to cost the <unk> days and what was i going to do to make <unk> 
 despite offering to refer her to ticket numbers requesting video conference set up evidence of my <unk> accessing the building 15 minutes before my shift the end result was i was 20 minutes late for work it 'd be added on at the end of the day and that was the end of it 
 she then demanded i called your work mobile 
 why do you not have your work mobile '' 
 aha - one i can win : you had me give it away to a new starter in monday 's it induction 
 angie demanded to know why i had n't ordered another one from vodafone 
 sadly vodafone have already <unk> our contracted quota of blackberry smartphones the <unk> we have are basically junk and do n't integrate with email - kinda crucial for our work - and until the new starter feels like swapping back my blackberry for a rubbish nokia i would be without 
 not a very likely scenario as you can imagine 
 sadly no ... i did n't win 
 ordered to retrieve an old nokia and new sim card she demanded to know if other members of 2nd line were also similarly <unk> 
 i knew where this was headed no more <unk> for anyone 
 we 'd all be on the rubbish parts-bin <unk> by the end of the day 
 this made me wonder about the subject of the rat 
 on the one hand given i had now inadvertently <unk> my team twice now <unk> into <unk> of inevitable verbal doom by her <unk> clever <unk> i just wondered if the rat was indeed all of us who at various times had fallen foul of her twisted bent nature 
 but no 
 someone showed her how to use a printer someone retrieved ticket logs from touchpaper someone put her onto the it cupboard ... the thought bothered me 
 an urgent call awaited my attention when i got back coffee now cold and bitter to the taste 
 it seemed a pa had a <unk> pc 
 rushing up to the scene it seemed that someone had attempted to help the pa out prior to her calling support 
 the 18 year old work experience kid they had up there diagnosed a ram problem and tried to <unk> it 
 however this had failed to do the job and the pa remained with a beeping machine 
 after trying a few rudimentary things it was apparent that there was no quick fix 
 i unplugged and picked it up promising to return moments later with one of our spare stock machines by way of a temporary fix 
 not ideal but at least she could get to her profile data we used roaming profiles and use standard services 
 a <unk> made for the it cupboard i found my card failed to open the door 
 i tried again no luck 
 defeated i made my way back to the desk pa 's machine in hand 
 i returned with mafg whose card also failed to unlock the door 
 the reason became clear upon our return to its 
 one of our number who had hit a similar problem had found out that angie had also demanded our access be removed from the it cupboard 
 from now on access was to be via facilities and only after her approval 
 great 
 especially useful as angie had already left the office with her drinking group to <unk> with yet another of starbucks many <unk> 
 running around like a <unk> trying to find anyone from facilities who was n't already changing a light bulb or driving a <unk> and was willing to bend the rules slightly 
 a few 3rd liners tried their access cards to find that they too were now <unk> from our <unk> bounty 
 our actions were similarly <unk> when pleading our case towards balding it head who simply responded that he supported angie 's decision and that <unk> hardware was technically responsibility of facilities 
 ok maybe technically but this is stupid 
 30 minutes later still no angie still no facilities 
 the pa 's <unk> attempt to get news on her machine came through from helpdesk closely followed by a call from he dept head demanding to know why we were stopping his pa from working 
 ok nothing for it lets see what we can do with her machine 
 already receiving glares from three fat finance ladies as i begin tearing the side off her machine we set to work 
 after various tests mafg and i agree that the power supply sounds like the culprit 
 kicking my machine off as they 're the same model i can only think to try mine 
 15 minutes later armed only with a knife stained with old jam which had been liberated from the canteen at some point and found in someone 's drawer i managed to remove psu screws from my machine 's psu and the <unk> machine 
 a quick <unk> to exchange the pa 's psu we hastily hook back up the cables 
 a quick power on test reveals the glorious windows xp boot screen problem solved 
 we shut it down carefully reattach the bits and pieces and i make for the elevator leaving my own machine stranded on my desk like a <unk> chicken the murder weapon with most of the jam scraped left adjacent 
 i 've <unk> pa lady 's machine but it 's all too late 
 her boss is chewing me out over there now being an hour lost of her time 
 despite my best attempts to calm the situation down citing a problem with security access he vows to email my manager immediately going so far as to demand names 
 pa lady thanks me anyway for my efforts in as an apologetic way as she can 
 the day plays itself out to conclusion 
 it takes me until the afternoon to find anyone from facilities to let me into the it cupboard 
 i retrieve a power supply for my own machine and reattach it in the same <unk> like style as it had been withdrawn 
 angie passes my desk as i finish up pointed at the knife and demanded what is that 
 i got <unk> of the way into the first sentence of explaining its role in <unk> a new power supply when she snapped take it back to the canteen right now '' 
 i spent the rest of the day on desk visits <unk> users around various windows issues doing a desk move and i finish the day up with mentoring a guy on the virtues of active directory 
 i knew i had an angie <unk> coming 
 i was expecting it at any minute 
 but to my surprise angie left for the day ... what ... no come back 
 no dragging into the meeting room of doom for another lesson in stupid 
 that pa 's boss was very <unk> about laying the <unk> 
 where is it 
 driving home it bothered me that angie had said nothing about this complaint 
 had she realized she was wrong 
 no ... i dismissed that very quickly 
 total bitches like that are never wrong in their eyes 
 it usually means that people like me failed to understand properly and need a shouting at to get it through my thick skull 
 but where was the backlash 
 i was stopped at lights watching a mother <unk> her child as they crossed the road 
 this made me realize 
 it was all just another <unk> <unk> by angie 
 she knew that i knew there was a complaint 
 she knew i 'd be expecting her to smack me down over it 
 but what she knew and what i did n't think of until now was that there was no sense on doing this on a friday 
 it 's the weekend after all 
 she wants this exact situation ... she wants me wondering what sort of <unk> <unk> me monday morning - and she wants me to think about this all weekend just anything to make sure the stress builds up 
 oh angie ... clever 
 very clever 
 previous <unk> : <unk> <unk> is my first tfts story i am not too great with formatting so please do forgive me if it looks awful and it is an <unk> 
 ** so a little bit of <unk> i am a 14 year old kid who is fairly decent with computers unfortunately my mother thinks it is okay to tell everyone and their mother about this so of course she brings home 2-3 computers every week for me to fix for free as a favor to her friends 
 i have asked her multiple times to not do this but she shrugs it off i do n't really mind that much but it is still a little annoying 
 anyways about 3 days ago she came home with this windows xp machine with matching monitor mouse and keyboard and a phone i am kinda confused why the she put a office phone in there but whatever 
 my mom says to call her friend to ask her what she wants me to do with it i call her and she says she just wants some important medical documents '' off the computer and to put it on her flash drive i tell her that i can do that and i will call her when i am finished 
 now this came off a little odd to me because i wondered why she could n't just simply copy and paste these files herself i shrug it off and boot the machine 
 when i see what is on the login screen i literally say out loud what the fuck '' 
 on the login screen there is a cisco <unk> vpn and a domain login for a very large medical insurance company also in the corner a little box saying it is completely <unk> to login without being a member of this company etc etc now i am pretty sure it is completely illegal to even try to login in to this thing without violating hippa laws 
 so i call her 
 <unk> anon : her me : me & gt me : '' hey i was just wondering why it is asking for login credentials for a vpn and insert large medical insurance company here domain '' 
 & gt anon : oh that it is jus -- '' & gt me : is this your computer '' 
 & gt anon : umm kind of i work for this company and i just wanted some copies of the medical documents for insert some person 's name here '' & gt me : umm i am pretty sure what you 're asking me to do is completely illegal if you did n't already know even copying these files for personal use goes against hippa laws 
 also it is completely illegal for me to even try and log on to this computer 
 please come pick it up and bring it back to your office '' 
 <unk> she then says very fast and worried : okay okay okay 
 i will come right now to pick it up sorry for bothering you 
 right now i am extremely confused as to why she wanted me to do something like that and also why she sent me this computer in the first place she could have done this by herself 
 she is lucky i did n't try to contact the company about this i am trying to figure out what she was up to 
 this happened at a web hosting company which also offers domain name registration service 
 <unk> woman is calls in : i 'm dissatisfied with your web hosting '' me : oh 
 i 'm sorry to hear that 
 was there something you were trying to get your website to do that i could help with '' 
 we offer many free scripts and often help customers with their setup and use 
 is : no i just want a <unk> 
 me : i 'm afraid there 's nothing to refund our hosting services are provided free of charge '' is : i paid you $ 25 '' me : that was for the domain name registration for 1 year 
 hosting is a different <unk> 
 is : give me back my money '' 
 me : i ca n't give you back money for that service since we did n't take any money from you for that service '' is : can you refund the domain name purchase '' 
 me : no 
 domain name registrations are strictly non-refundable since once a name is registered that registration can not be reversed 
 we make it very clear during the <unk> process that all fees for domain registrations are non-refundable '' is : i still want you to refund me for whatever part of my $ 25 the web hosting is worth '' me getting annoyed : ok done '' 
 is : you <unk> me '' 
 me : yes 
 since the hosting is <unk> at $ 0 i have just given you $ 0 '' * click * previous i looked down at the laptop on the ground 
 i pinched my nose and tried not to scream 
 & gt me : so tell me again how did this happen 
 & gt defiant : this lady here was carrying the personal computer from its position on the desk to a place closer to the physical connection for the internet which while in transit the device became dislodged from her grip 
 said device then came upon the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> downwards 
 upon connection with the ground the momentum of the device had its energy dissipated into the device itself which has alas led to the current situation 
 the lady in question looked furious at that response 
 her eyes were wild she was angry 
 & gt fury : it did not become <unk> 
 you pushed me 
 & gt defiant : we had no contact i was all the way over here 
 how could i have even touched you ... my eyes fell fixed on the laptop on the ground 
 its screen was defiantly broken a crack across palm rest spoke of even more damage 
 i picked it up off the floor 
 & gt me : so… i spoke slowly and stared down at the boy and angry lady in front of me 
 i tried to draw out my words 
 & gt me : between the two of you you’ve smashed up a laptop… 
 & gt fury : it wasn’t… 
 i held up my hand for silence and continued slowly 
 & gt me : then… after completely destroying the device you’ve had a shouting match for five minutes leaving the computer on the floor 
 & gt defiant : i don’t think this is a fair representation of… 
 my stare honed in on defiant until his mouth stopped moving 
 & gt me : and finally instead of <unk> sincerely to the person that now has to clean up this whole mess you attempt to start a second shouting match 
 is that a fair <unk> 
 i waited for the apologies to come streaming in 
 my ears eagerly <unk> “i’m sorry” 
 & gt fury : he 
 pushed 
 me 
 fury looked angrily at defiant 
 i started to wonder who was really the child here 
 & gt defiant : i did <unk> i mean… i’m sorry 
 airz 
 i shouldn’t have been shouting 
 & gt me : get this computer down to it defiant 
 and you fury 
 get back to work 
 fury seemed incensed 
 & gt fury : he pushed me so i broke my computer and you’re not even going to <unk> him 
 i smiled and walked away 
 ***** back in it defiant held the broken computer in one hand 
 a fearful look in his eyes 
 & gt defiant : sorry 
 again 
 that was unprofessional 
 i was honestly surprised 
 it was the first time he’d not used long winded ways of saying things 
 & gt me : as punishment 
 fix that computer in your hand 
 & gt defiant : with… what parts 
 i pointed to the scraps bin where computers went to die 
 & gt defiant : but… none of them are even the same <unk> i smiled at him 
 & gt me : you’ll make it work 
 it’s a challenge 
 ***** a few hours later i checked up on defiant 
 he’d managed to find a screen to retro fit into the computer 
 & gt me : how did you go 
 defiant held up a working computer 
 he looked exhausted 
 & gt defiant : it’s all blurry on startup but it works when you hit the desktop 
 & gt me : good enough 
 did you have fun 
 defiant eyes glazed over in a slightly <unk> way 
 & gt defiant : that was hell 
 literally hell 
 i smiled at defiant as i threw the laptop he’d handed me into the scraps bin 
 & gt me : welcome to it 
 next previous i had been called up to to the executive floor to drop off a list for the company lawyer on the it loses incurred from the destruction of the air conditioner 
 lawyers come in two categories good and dangerous 
 i wondered which type of lawyer our company would use 
 as i arrived at the meeting room i was surprised to also see the vp sitting at the table next to a well dressed man 
 & gt vp : airz come in 
 & gt me : yes i’m just here to drop off this list of equipment 
 the vp took a look at this list i passed across the table 
 the list wasn’t very long… 
 & gt vp : sit down lets get you some coffee 
 the vp summoned a secretary to get me a coffee 
 & gt vp : now this list it isn’t … everything you replaced is it 
 & gt me : what do you mean 
 a coffee arrived 
 & gt vp : in the last few months much more equipment was replaced then just these items… the vp gestured down to the list 
 & gt me : for upgrades and general maintenance sure 
 & gt vp : wouldn’t you say those items needed replacing sooner as a direct result of damage they <unk> from the event 
 i looked over at the lawyer he was staring out the window 
 & gt me : no 
 equipment just needs replacing occasionally 
 & gt vp : see the longer this list is airz… the better it would be for everyone 
 & gt me : hahaha i for one am glad he didn’t destroy any more equipment 
 the lawyer finally decided to join in the conversation 
 & gt law : maybe you should take a long think about this… & gt airz : sorry 
 & gt law : well a few months is a long time perhaps you missed some items off this list 
 & gt airz : no i think i got everything 
 law sits back in his chair and gives a nod to the vp 
 & gt vp : airz no one would know… if you did accidentally er… forget some things 
 & gt law : yes 
 no one would know if forgotten items where added now 
 & gt me : forgotten items… 
 i looked down at my coffee 
 real coffee doesn’t do <unk> 
 this was real coffee 
 & gt vp : anything you can think of 
 i sat back in my chair 
 i smiled 
 & gt me : no no 
 that list is complete 
 & gt law : ahh well i think that <unk> this meeting 
 & gt vp : no no i don’t think he’s gotten the message 
 airz if you just… 
 & gt law : i’m going to stop you there vp 
 & gt vp : wha… the lawyer gave me a quick look up and down 
 & gt law : trust me this one… he isn’t <unk> <unk> 
 the vp looked livid he stared at me 
 coffee told me not to blink 
 when the vp spoke his voice was filled with rage 
 & gt vp : everyone <unk> 
 everyone is a <unk> 
 the room just went silent after that 
 i took a sip of my coffee 
 it <unk> me to break the silence 
 & gt me : not the big boss though right 
 i looked down at my coffee 
 mistake 
 next i walked into the office tuesday morning brandishing a starbucks <unk> with a ginger shot 
 it was my little way of celebrating my minor victory of no customers waiting to tear my face off for lack of machines 
 ok there was a little part of me happy about getting just a little win over angie 
 my mind was already on the task of prepping up some laptops for the next round of inductees due in a few weeks 
 at this rate i may even get time to reimage my own machine as it badly needed it 
 into the office i go exchanging light pleasantries with the security guards 
 now i 'm not sure why i did n't expect it 
 i thought the battle was won this round was done and <unk> and more importantly the meeting room booked for the week 
 mafg looked at me in sympathy as a crowd <unk> around meeting room 6. bhit with two facilities guys and several third line guys were gathered in what seemed to be some sort of epic <unk> akin to one of those american cop shows exercising a search warrant 
 i walked straight up to own my actions nonchalantly still brandishing my victory coffee 
 bhit seemed to ignore me at first issuing orders to some of the third liners unplugging my gear 
 turning his <unk> to me his usually weak and <unk> voice had now transformed into an authoritative bark as he demanded i do n't know what you 're playing it but this is not on 
 you can not turn a meeting room into a comms room '' 
 add in more <unk> with health and safety concerns my explanation of complete lack of build space and subsequent apathy by both him and angie was why i took matters into my own hands rather than annoy several customers still waiting on machines 
 i was ordered back to my desk 
 the <unk> monkeys <unk> down my man-cave which i had lovingly <unk> together in as temporary and easily mobile a fashion i could 
 the familiar green t-shirt clad facilities guys wheeled away my contraband as i watched the rest of my now <unk> coffee disappearing down my throat as <unk> as my victory 
 as it would seem this would eventually serve to complicate matters wholly as the customer machines which had been imaged or were waiting for imaging were taken off to some <unk> <unk> hole where i was unable to get at them 
 in fact as it would later <unk> i would never see those desktops ever again 
 all the while angie sat with her back to me presumably trying to get to grips with touchpaper 
 i knew she was everything to do with it but at the same time it was only bhit and facilities people up there 
 my answers were provided moments later when bhit came for another chat telling me in no uncertain terms that booking a meeting room to perform it work was totally out of bounds 
 right at that moment fat finance bint appeared by his side 
 she was <unk> to get her say in too 
 suddenly this was making sense 
 in her <unk> tuned <unk> vocal tone that could have only been honed over an extensive career of patronizing anyone who crossed her path she <unk> with me that my actions were selfish and wrong you ca n't just take over meeting rooms we need those rooms all the time for legal purposes 
 you ca n't just take one they are n't there for you to just use '' as you please '' 
 her rising <unk> that completed every sentence drove through my skull like <unk> nails on a <unk> 
 amazing 
 in the time i 've been there i do n't think i 've ever seen finance use one of the meeting rooms once 
 in fact there were eight of them and two were used as archive storage and not locked either 
 most of the rooms sat unused day in day out 
 but now i see the path of <unk> 
 angie did n't like the fact she 'd lost fat finance bint complained on her behalf to her manager he called his people they called their people they eventually called bhit who immediately agreed with his higher ups 
 i threw down the <unk> 
 we used to build all the time in the it cupboard 
 that was suddenly <unk> 
 we can not build at our desks we can not use any of the server rooms as there 's no space and now when i book a meeting room through the proper channels to get some work done this is suddenly out of bounds 
 exactly how are we supposed to do our jobs '' 
 i followed this up by <unk> clicking through several open tickets pointing out several tickets requiring build time 
 bhit stood mute as impotent as ever 
 he did n't have the answers or the means to get them 
 he just simply retorted well this is the first i 've heard of any problems 
 you need to communicate with your manager more '' 
 how can it be this difficult to just do your damned job 
 that day i happened to lunch with one of the third line guys 
 i relayed to him our tales of woe following angie 's arrival 
 he was almost stunned 
 he did mention how he 's been unable to access the it cupboard for a while but when he was 2nd line the it cupboard was always the build area 
 nevertheless i had to admit defeat 
 i 'd already made so many positive impressions up the ladder being cited as a troublemaker was not something that would have been useful 
 i returned to my desk to the first of many emails from a customer dutifully cc'ing their managers in a typical <unk> style : where is my machine 
 you took it three days ago and i 'm still having to use the spare laptop you gave me '' 
 it seemed i was now more behind 
 work was piling up inter-team tensions were getting high and all the while angie sat and clicked around various tickets not saying a word 
 fearing a further <unk> i took finger to keyboard and again demanded angie and bhit work out where our build areas should be 
 as the afternoon grew <unk> i carried on desk visits refusing to take any more machines away 
 angie rose from her desk at 5pm and in an unnatural tone just said night all 
 she had managed to win the entire battle without lifting a finger nearly <unk> in her arrogant yet <unk> <unk> 
 clearly this beast of hell was more learned than me in the art of war - and it seemed she held all the cards too 
 was there to be no retribution for this 
 **previous** pt1 : a new world order pt2 : safety first pt3 : the it induction from hell pt4 : undercurrents pt5 : how to make friends and ... pt6 : marking territories pt7 : one friday to rue them all pt8 : best laid plans pt9 : its one step for man so got a call this morning from a family member '' i never ever hear from 
 i 'm not even sure how she got my number probably passed on by someone else 
 & gt fm : hey <unk> 
 i think i got a virus on my computer since i kept getting popups about tojan this tojan that 
 i click ignored on the popups since i did n't know if i should guarantee '' them or delete '' them 
 i 'm pretty sure the guarantee on this computer has expired 
 & gt me : ok well <unk> definitely sounds like a virus but that could have been internet popups are you sure it came from your antivirus 
 & gt fm : well i do n't know what antivirus is but these are given to us by the company so i do n't know anything about them 
 & gt me : wait wait are you calling from work 
 & gt fm : well yes our home computer is working fine 
 & gt me : have you called your it department 
 they really should be the one looking at this & gt fm : no are n't you family 
 ca n't you just get on my computer and clean it out for me 
 & gt me : maybe i could but it 's really not for me to put my hands in 
 the it department should really look at it they will know what to do and can likely give you a replacement if it needs to be completely cleaned out 
 it would be risky and likely against policy for me to do any work on them 
 i also do n't think the it department would appreciate me invoicing them for it 
 & gt fm : invoicing 
 but your family 
 it only takes a minute of your time i thought you would be willing to help out i heard so many good things about you ... i guess they were wrong 
 & gt me : listen like anyone else i ca n't spend my days fixing everyone 's work problems especially if they have it people fully capable of doing the work which they 're paid to do 
 if it was your home computer maybe but this is really not something i 'm comfortable working on & gt fm : you should have just told me you did n't know how to fix it instead of making up excuses i 'm just going to call other family member good with computers and he 'll fix it & gt me : that 's not what i ... & gt fm : *click* you just ca n't get through some of them ... <unk> <unk> <unk> this is probably going to be a long one <unk> so to set the stage i <unk> my environment from the previous it that left without so much as even the wifi password so there 's settings that i did n't set or check as i believed he was a strong administrator 
 so we have a user let 's call him bob 
 i have n't liked bob since the day that i started working at my job as a sysadmin 
 he <unk> around people 's desk waiting for them to say something first even if he has something to say sometimes for up to 20 minutes if you simply ignore him 
 we have quite a lot running on a single server with the unfortunate bit of it controlling printing file management our day to day programs on the network our documentation and for the most part it 's pretty accessible to most users to be able to modify documents since they need to be able to create work instructions and whatnot 
 so bob is one of my people i support that is a problem person to begin with 
 his outlook somehow magically breaks he is required by his manager to be able to install programs for his job and with that comes your casual spyware and whatnot that i constantly have to wipe his butt about 
 this later will haunt me 
 so monday i am sitting at my desk and one of the managers tells me that the president of the company ca n't access his files 
 this is a very big deal so it takes top priority 
 i go to his files to see that all of his files are ending in <unk> for the file extensions so say a spreadsheet was <unk> now 
 i did n't know much about why it happened so simply <unk> the file to remove the added extension showed a garbled mess 
 this is when i realized that the files are being encrypted 
 i checked out his pc and it 's entirely clean not even the simplest issue with his pc for what i can find 
 as i 'm checking this pc more people are reporting the issue 
 i send out an immediate email saying that they need to save any files locally as i 'm pulling the plug on the server to start checking things out and with a huge <unk> from users i assure them this is a last resort option 
 the server like the president 's computer was absolutely clean but tons of the files were encrypted 
 we take a look at the <unk> for when the first file became encrypted and started getting the dhcp timestamps for who got a new ip at this time in case it was a <unk> computer that was connected to our network that was causing the issues and it just so happened that we had a list of 40 or so pcs that grabbed a new ip during a 5 minute period 
 my supervisor and i start checking every last pc on the list and a lot of them showed no issue and a handful of them showed encrypted files 
 i start checking for malware and happened to miss the one that had the malware on it so we start disconnecting all pcs on the list to stop the bleeding and start copying my backup to the drives <unk> by the encryption 
 we spend about 14 hours after this point after already working roughly 6 hours that day getting things back to normal and notice that another drive was being encrypted on top of the ones we had fixed and it 's a department drive 
 we see who all has access to both drives and then start checking pcs the next day with our server pulled back off the network and low and behold bob is on the list 
 bob comes to my desk first thing in the morning complaining that his piece of junk '' computer $ <unk> thinkpad from 2015 does n't boot anymore 
 we also noticed that whatever pc was doing the encryption has stopped 
 <unk> <unk> mind you this user tried blaming me for his pc issues after working on his pc as if i do n't know what i 'm doing 
 i try to start his laptop up and the thing wo n't even act like it 's loading windows 
 just splash screen black screen splash screen etc 
 i take out his hdd and toss it onto a dock and i immediately get a call from my hq saying that my protection software is lighting up like a christmas tree 
 this is our guy 
 he 's complaining about not having the ability to do his work and i 'm working with hq to get things back online 
 before i reimage the machine though they wanted a full log of all the bad things from his hdd scan and it was quite a bit 
 essentially his pc was so bad that it encrypted everything but the os and something else came in and destroyed the boot loader 
 we are now finally back to normal '' with tons of permissions redone properly this time and backing up everything again like a <unk> 
 we are going to be discussing his fate with my supervisor manager him and his manager today 
 also his laptop feels like the back was <unk> with a high grit <unk> 
 now given everything through the time i 've been here i wanted it to not be him 
 i was hoping for the one redeeming factor of believing it was him and seeing someone else fall but it had to be bob 
 **tl : dr** user who is bad with computers '' <unk> nearly my entire server taking most of our company offline for the entire <unk> it took from pulling the plug to getting the server back online where users can work 
 probably going to use this as the final excuse of why we need a redundant server 
 edit : one detail i forgot to put in is that he installed a trial mcafee because he believed it was going to be better than our installed protection which caused our protection to go <unk> as he defaulted it to the expired av from over a year ago 
 ok. so years ago i used to work for a company made business software 
 the software we created made a ridiculously complex task merely complex and companies all over the world use it to save them big bucks in the cost of doing business 
 i was the qa test lead for the as/400 platform in addition to our other platforms on our <unk> product 
 we covered a wide variety of platforms but the as/400 was our largest base and the assignment to that platform demanded zero mistakes 
 so we had just completed testing and shipping a software update that was not only <unk> needed for the fixes in it but also for the mandatory compliance updates it held without which the clients would <unk> be dead in the water after the deadline 
 the day before the deadline i get a call from one of my friends who is a platform programmer for this product on the as/400 
 <unk> we have a client that ca n't install add-on # 2 to <unk> <unk> did you test it '' 
 of course i tested it 
 my job <unk> on that getting rolled out and ready to go 
 user says it installs everything but the add-on # 2 and he is dead in the water 
 can you check it out 
 customer service is trying to fix it with him on the phone '' 
 this is not a new user either 
 this is their senior operator for our product and he knows shit from <unk> 
 i 'm screwed 
 now my office was on the 2nd floor and the server room is on the 4th 
 since i had to manually load the cd 's in the optical drive and initiate the install from the terminal emulator at my desk i ended up running up and down the stairs <unk> times to run a clean install of the product which meant one trip for the main program and one trip for each of the <unk> 
 i wiped the machine re-installed the product add-on # 1 and add-on # 2 with no problem 
 in between runs upstairs frantic runs i might add as i pondered what i would be carrying my things out in when they fired me cs and the platform specialists blew up my phone with questions 
 i did this 3 times running up and down the stairs completely soaked in sweat and <unk> how long it had been since i had done any real <unk> 
 on my last trip up as i shot through the hallway on the 4th floor to the server room to try and break it again my best buddy dave the platform specialist is standing in the hallway with cup of coffee in hand laughing his ass off at me with actual tears streaming down his face 
 this is n't funny asshole 
 i 'm going to lose my job if i ca n't figure this out '' 
 it 's hilarious '' says dave cs just called me and they figured out what the problem was '' 
 my god what was it 
 i ca n't recreate it '' 
 cs happened to dig around in their account while they were trying to solve it 
 client could n't install it because they did n't purchase add-on # 2. they 've never had it and had no reason to install it '' 
 fortunately the client was on the west coast and we were on the east or i 'd be writing this story from prison as a convicted <unk> right now 
 edited punctuation <unk> have a feeling way too many of us have experienced this situation 
 corporate policy dictates that users can not get upgraded hardware 
 replacements are same as 
 common sense does not apply 
 one site that i was supporting made the decision to upgrade from xp to 7. user calls with a complaint of a poor performing pc 
 apps were taking forever to load 
 other apps were crashing randomly 
 the best course of action was clearly to re image the device after i brought the machine to our cave i looked at the specs 
 it was a dell optiplex <unk> with 256mb ram 
 i brought it to the attention of the team lead who instantly screams at me how many times do i have to tell you 
 no upgrades 
 that 'll run fine on 256mb '' 
 uh rodent win 7 's minimum spec calls for at least 2gb 
 in fact it <unk> 4 '' 
 just re image it as is '' 
 so i do what i am told to do and naturally the customer is upset because of how slow the machine is running but there is nothing i can do 
 the customer rightfully so starts making a <unk> about his new issues 
 next thing i know i 'm being called into the office 
 why did you re image his machine with windows 7 '' 
 i was doing what you told me to do '' 
 do n't tell me what i told you to do '' 
 i do n't work there any more 
 previous frozen i waited like the last biscuit in a packet knowing my fate 
 i was about to be <unk> by the mouth of a human and i could n't do anything about it 
 i knew it was coming 
 i waited 
 the red haired lady looked up at me our eyes locked 
 this is it 
 her mouth opened 
 i waited for the crushing 
 & gt redcheer : airz 
 i was just about to come get you 
 perfect timing always know where you’re wanted aye 
 & gt me : i … wha 
 i slowly came to the realization that i wasn’t actually a biscuit i was escaping the trap fate had laid out for me 
 no screaming for me today 
 & gt redcheer : so i finished installing windows and i copied all my files over to this computer 
 redcheer then turned the screen around so i could see it from my position lying in the roof 
 the computer however was off so my diagnostic <unk> were slightly … lacking 
 & gt me : okay… & gt redcheer : but none of the programs are working properly so i looked it up on the internet 
 i looked down at the computer it hit me that i was doing tech support from the ceiling 
 it was oddly fun 
 & gt me : that’ll be the registry probably 
 & gt redcheer : that 's what the internet said too 
 they said i need a registry <unk> uh oh 
 & gt redcheer : but the internet said it should only be used by people who knew what they where doing 
 & gt me : huh 
 & gt redcheer : so i was about to come get you 
 you can show me how you guys get these <unk> from working properly 
 & gt me : well… to be honest we actually have a disk image that your normal tech made before he left 
 i looked over at the red haired lady she threw me a confused face 
 i finally figured out she didn’t know what i was talking about she’d made me think she was another tech 
 talking about <unk> <unk> … who does that but techs 
 & gt me : oh… er an image is like a clone of the old drive 
 & gt redcheer : so all this was useless 
 she looked over at her computer she’d just spent an age installing windows on she seemed pretty sad 
 & gt me : er no its not useless 
 not if you learnt something and you learn by <unk> 
 remember 
 the red haired lady looked down at her computer a moment longer then suddenly looked up she was beaming with happiness again 
 & gt redcheer : you 're in the roof 
 & gt me : haha yeah 
 & gt redcheer : that 's so cool 
 i looked about it really wasn’t cool 
 & gt me : actually its pretty awful its dusty cramped and you can’t stand up 
 & gt redcheer : so cool though 
 & gt me : are you even listening to me 
 she wasn’t 
 in fact she’d already left the room i was hanging from the ceiling in 
 about thirty seconds later i heard banging on the ladder it was almost on the other side of the building 
 as i thought about how quickly she got over the other side of the office and found the ladder i heard a loud bang 
 a loud bang followed closely by ... <unk> oh… 
 the scream found me eventually 
 so i am a biscuit 
 next i originally posted this but either deleted it or did n't submit it 
 as part of government service i was supposed to take a training course each year 
 my boss decided that he would send me on an exchange course which was n't strictly my job area but parts <unk> 
 a week later he stopped by my desk 
 & gt boss : dpg i need you to work on something for us 
 our service desk software already <unk> emails but if anyone emails our public folder it needs to acknowledge that 
 we must respond to them within 24 hours 
 & gt me : surely an automated response does n't count and they want something more personal such as a phone call or a <unk> email 
 & gt boss : not at this time 
 it 's purely a receipt email 
 & gt me : then just turn on read receipts for the mail domain 
 case closed 
 & gt boss : not everyone emails from inside the organisation especially if their email is faulty or they 're a school 
 & gt me : i suppose we could put an <unk> on it 
 it would be <unk> but we could put images and other stuff on it 
 & gt boss : write a proposal and you can run it by the change advisory group 
 report written i head to the <unk> meeting on friday and we discuss it 
 & gt <unk> : brilliant idea 
 how do you want to implement it 
 & gt me : i was going to leave that to the servers team 
 & gt <unk> : ok. we 'll approve the change on the provision that servers make the change 
 for about six months we used this without incident 
 send us an email and you get a message back to say thank you and that the call will be looked at within your sla 
 a link to the sla and the latest news item were also included 
 then we consulted with a different team and set theirs up 
 before we knew it <unk> seperate teams within the council had this and the it departments of partner <unk> - nhs and the local hospital 
 the nhs it department sent us an advisory on the issue of new <unk> readers 
 our email received it and pinged back a response 
 their email responded to ours and their response generated a response from our server 
 this kicked off at <unk> on a day when i was n't due in till 9. by the time i got in everyone was in a state of panic 
 our mail queue had around a thousand messages in it and no email was going out 
 the server was so overloaded that the remote management software would n't connect 
 the server team arrived five minutes after me coffees in hands and after a thirty minute meeting went to the server room and disconnected the ethernet cable from the rear of the exchange servers 
 they then removed the <unk> restarted the servers and <unk> 
 & gt head of it : this mail flood we had was your fault dpg 
 it 's cost us who knows how much money in wasted time to fix 
 i hate it when government or similar services attempt to <unk> their losses or the work they do 
 they never lose money on anything as they do n't sell <unk> or services 
 & gt me : my report did state that two <unk> could cause a flood like this 
 it 's in the appendix under potential errors 
 & gt head of it : <unk> wave of his <unk> i never read the appendix on any report 
 & gt me : i 'm sure the server team looked at it 
 & gt server team leader : we did but we were <unk> i closed the door on my <unk> warm house on a <unk> frosty thursday morning clutching my car keys in one hand and a small plastic scraper in the other i immediately regretted my decision of not purchasing gloves the previous night while shopping 
 my car bellowed smoke as it churned into life as my red cracking knuckles powered the scraper into the solid ice on the car windows 
 the fact i had purchased a ford for it 's clever <unk> <unk> technology just seemed to <unk> me more as the damned thing was had failed to operate at all over the last few days 
 i made it to work and felt rather disappointed with the <unk> of <unk> rights <unk> - the promise of an impending and very visual protest outside the <unk> of the center as emailed by hr seemed rather overkill as i spied a single figure waving a poorly <unk> <unk> from near the gate being carefully watched by two security guards 
 it seemed a rather poor effort 
 i duly parked my car in the usual spot next to a brand new looking jaguar 
 i admired its sleek lines and somewhere in the back of my head thought that one of these days all this toil will be worth it 
 exchanging early morning pleasantries with various security guards i arrived at my desk and removing my jacket the cold <unk> <unk> 
 i could n't help but notice a familiar stern <unk> 
 jesus ... angie was here before me 
 there i was hoping for at least an hour or two of recovery from this morning 's voyage before having her in my face 
 mere moments had i sat down to get my machine warmed i reached into my drawer for my coffee cup only to find angie standing right next to me her <unk> akin to that of a <unk> serial <unk> 
 armed with her coffee cup she placed it on my desk dragged over a nearby chair and sat with notebook in hand 
 can i help '' 
 i politely inquired 
 i want to see what you get up to in the morning 
 i motioned towards my empty coffee cup but she meant business 
 you can get your tea later 
 i want to see what you 're going to do first open the paper program '' 
 she meant touchpaper ... the next two hours was like being dragged over icy <unk> naked 
 i had started the day with eleven open tickets six of which i knew were long ones and had already made <unk> to service that day 
 the other five i could knock out easily while waiting for builds to finish thus leaving plenty time free to pick up anything new that came in 
 angie 's plan was for me to pretty much assign myself almost every open ticket - even those not to do with 2nd line support 
 my colleagues started to arrive one by one and on seeing this spectacle shrunk into their seats trying to root out any ticket which would mean escaping their desks and the vicinity of angie 
 by 11 o'clock my queue looked like a <unk> had gone off 
 47 open tickets 
 <unk> - what was i meant to be doing this morning 
 angie had retreated back to her lair as middle-aged family guy sent me a quick communicator message do you want me to have a look at some of those cases for you '' 
 i duly replied whatever he <unk> doing go for it 
 after taking a couple of password resets angie 's snarl came from her desk ... jon6 i did not tell you to make others do your work for you 
 mafg if you have nothing to do i am more than happy to give you something to do '' 
 mafg quickly retreated back to his own call list without saying a word 
 5 motionless minutes elapsed until angie walked up to mafg and ordered him to accompany her 
 they disappeared into the murky depths of the corridor swallowed by the blackness to some horrible fate 
 i decided to keep to my plan that day 
 i retrieved five machines from <unk> desks and made for the it cupboard to get them re-imaged for some imminent <unk> and replacements 
 i sat in the dimly lit room as the unattended scripts did their bit i had a rep 's laptop in several bits to replace a faulty screen before he would leave for a flight 
 the sound of the security badge failing in the electronic lock followed by the <unk> knock on the door <unk> performed meant it could only have been one person 
 up until now although she knew it existed angie had no idea how to get to this place much less have access to it 
 putting on my <unk> i duly opened the door 
 immediately angie went for the neck a starbucks tall firmly <unk> in her bony fingers eyes like a <unk> 
 what are you doing in here 
 why are n't you at your desk 
 what is going on in here '' 
 i politely showed her around the it cupboard though what i really wanted to do was <unk> her with bits of dell laptop and bury her somewhere in with the junk <unk> <unk> kept only for <unk> and their outdated gear 
 the prospect of me attempting to fit her bitter bony body into a <unk> tower also crossed my mind 
 not happy with my explanation there 's a surprise she ordered me back to desk despite my protests that the rep was expecting their laptop back before leaving today for his flight to <unk> and the fact that the machines i was imaging needed to be on desks by close of business 
 <unk> at my desk she left me there with a now get on with your work and do n't let me catch you again '' 
 i felt impotent 
 time for a reaction 
 i figured if the above work does n't happen i 'm in it with several department heads 
 if i go back i 'm in it with angie 
 so i fired an email to balding it head cc'ing in angie asking for direction 
 it read i have work going on in the it cupboard which requires resolution 
 angie has made it clear that i am not to return to the it cupboard 
 can you please provide direction as to how this work should be completed '' 
 mere seconds after i signed my fate angie <unk> me and some spotty helpdesk kid back to the it cupboard 
 she ordered us complete the work as she watched and verified every step 
 of course spotty helpdesk kid had no idea what any of these 2nd line processes were about and questioned nearly every stage 
 an hour later we were finished and went our seperate ways to <unk> our efforts 
 as i walked away with two machines and a laptop bag <unk> she said i want you back at your desk in ten minutes do n't let me come looking for you '' 
 that afternoon angie sent us all an email 
 we could n't help but imagine it read aloud by her <unk> sharp tongue each <unk> almost <unk> in its context 
 her order was that the it cupboard is no longer to be used for any sort of maintenance or work it is for storage of computing equipment only 
 having recently learned that her circle of bitter women in positions of power that drink too much starbucks coffee '' also included some oversized tank of a hr administrator the <unk> to the cake was present and correct citing health and safety <unk> and that any further activities would be referred to management for disciplinary 
 a few of us held <unk> over our lost it cupboard as we watched several <unk> men from facilities tear down our nest 
 the glorious ghost server which held all our builds slammed onto a trolley ready for its trip back to the server room our beautifully installed network cabling and network switch was <unk> ripped from the wall and tossed into a rubbish old box our carefully ordered and neatly packed away <unk> were also in a box it seemed that they had been claimed in the name of facilities our electric kettle together with a tin containing our hotel and restaurant liberated <unk> of tea bags coffee sugar and <unk> <unk> were tossed into a black bag headed for the skip 
 we discussed the predicament in depth 
 how would we image machines with a three-item limit on our desks 
 where would we go to dismantle machines to replace or upgrade hardware 
 these <unk> were later echoed when one of the server admins asked i notice the ghost server is on a trolley in one of the network riser rooms i thought you guys needed that for building machines '' 
 yeah ... we did too 
 my shift ended and i made for the sanctuary of my car again a thick layer of ice and snow serving to only <unk> my progress 
 i again noticed the brand new jaguar which had miraculously seemed immune from the effects of this brutal british summer 
 you can all <unk> who was behind the wheel 
 angie glanced as she noticed me approach over her black leather steering wheel no smile or <unk> 
 she reversed out of her space as her shining black <unk> powered her away from my presence her work for the day was done 
 <unk> deflated i clicked my ford <unk> 's remote key 
 strange the remote would n't work 
 i put the key into the lock and the central locking groaned into life 
 sitting into my ice pit realizing the water that had leaked from the roof onto my seat had now frozen a quick turn of the key also revealed that it also would n't start 
 a few more tries and there could only be one culprit 
 my reward from the day 's toil was one flat battery and an hour waiting for the <unk> recovery person to arrive and give me a jump start 
 bang goes my early leaving time 
 what a day ... i’ve got a few weeks off between jobs 
 i had originally decided to go for a 2 week road trip 
 to <unk> the trip i had agreed to do some short term work with a friend of mine 
 a part of it was to create a phishing awareness presentation for a small financial services firm <unk> 
 i had put in financial services specific content talking about how the <unk> group had <unk> high ranking users into going to sites with fake owa login pages to steal email credentials 
 the <unk> phish was really <unk> it was an email from a client of the firm claiming that <unk> employee is disclosing sensitive data at this discussion thread 
 i may pull my <unk> with a link to a <unk> discussion board with fake owa authentication popups 
 i gave an example of the phish as well as sending around the <unk> report to <unk> it director 
 they were happy enough to pay me 
 a few weeks later i’m taking a break from my road trip at a gas station in a rural area looking for cold <unk> water and having to settle for <unk> 
 i check my phone and notice multiple texts and phone calls from <unk> head of accounting 
 seems there’s an emergency 
 i call the head of accounting 
 head of accounting : ”that thing <unk> me : <unk> which thing ” head of accounting : ”that phishing thing” me : <unk> so you’re getting similar <unk> 
 just delete them and remind people not to click on the <unk> head of accounting : <unk> do i make it stop ” me : ”i made some recommendations to the director of it but <unk> going to completely eliminate <unk> head of accounting : <unk> 
 i entered my username and password but it keeps popping back up 
 i want to see who is posting sensitive <unk> me : <unk> 
 i didn’t understand before 
 i can’t help you 
 you need to call your director of it and he needs to call my friend 
 you all have to do a password <unk> head of accounting : <unk> need to help us <unk> me : ”i tried to help you when i told you about this scam 
 i must not have been helpful 
 call my friend <unk> this sounds unbelievable because honestly who is this stupid but i swear to god this really happened today and only you guys will understand 
 so i 'm helping a customer reset their password running through the usual <unk> 
 here 's exactly how it went ... me : your password has to be at least 8 characters long with an <unk> and lowercase letter and a number in it 
 customer : so it has to be 8 characters 
 me : yes or more 
 it just has to be at least 8 characters 
 customer : can it be 7 characters 
 me : <unk> <unk> if it was n't for their completely vacant stare i would 've assumed they were totally f*cking with me but no just stupid 
 i 'm not it officially yet 
 <unk> me know if this story does n't belong <unk> i guess it does 
 thank you all 
 i 'm a designer in a small company 
 our it guy left the country a few months ago and since i 'm technically inclined '' i 've somehow been turned into the in-office it guy 
 i can imagine thats a story you 've heard before 
 being a small company it 's a very casual setting 
 lots of grumpy <unk> that swear frequently and <unk> their hardware when stuff goes wrong 
 i tried telling them to be nice to their computers otherwise they wo n't listen to you '' 
 and so it has become sort of a running joke that i can talk to the computers since 90 % of their issues are very simple fixes 
 which brings me to today 
 i 've been very busy the last week so i had not had a chance to look at a computer that everyone just told me had gone to shit 
 i turned it on an sure enough it was completely messed up 
 i wish i had taken a picture but there was a lot of random <unk> and colour and noise all over the screen 
 i sat there for a moment 
 another seemingly impossible situation that i 've never been in before 
 i just stared at the screen while weighing my options 
 is it a hardware fault 
 should i take the hd out 
 has the video card failed 
 i 'm not trained in it but i 'm a pretty good problem <unk> so i was taking pretty wild <unk> 
 i moved the mouse around a little bit and noticed some of the <unk> changed accordingly 
 eventually i noticed distorted letters scattered around the screen 
 and a blue bar around the top 
 i realized there was a window there but it was impossible to make anything of it 
 i managed to grab hold of it 
 i started moving it around and saw about <unk> % of the <unk> on the screen were displaying correctly 
 moving the windows through one of these readable blocks made it possible to read the letters one buy one 
 i was able to make out the words do you want to restore '' 
 it sounded promising so i found the ok button and clicked it twice 
 computer restarted and was fine 
 i turned the monitor towards my co-workers with a huge grin on my face 
 i 'd like to say that the office erupted in applause but that would n't be true 
 some <unk> <unk> was heard though 
 one of them had a face that looked confused and horrified 
 i 'm scared of you <unk> but i ca n't say i 'm surprised '' he said 
 edit : thanks for the gold and the warm welcome to the subreddit 
 i have some others stories that i will be sure to share with you on a later <unk> have a helpdesk app which has an agent that launches the helpdesk portal on our user 's computers 
 the agent is <unk> and it <unk> data and allows remote connections etc 
 however most of what the user ever sees is if i press f11 the helpdesk opens '' 
 well the agent configuration was messed up on a user 's machine 
 if he hit f11 it popped up a window that said choose the program you would like to open this file : <unk> '' then showed a list of programs to choose from when i saw this i was n't paying close enough attention 
 so my brain said helpdesk open in browser 
 i click browser '' and i selected internet explorer 
 windows said ok 
 put an entry in the registry : from now on all .exe files will open in internet explorer '' 
 at once every icon on his desktop changed to an internet explorer icon 
 i checked default programs first maybe i could just reset the association 
 unfortunately there is no entry to set a default for .exe files because who in their right mind would set a .exe file association 
 alright looks like i have to do this manually 
 let 's open <unk> 
 start & gt run & gt <unk> internet explorer pops open would you like to run or save regedit.exe '' 
 i click run 
 internet explorer pops open would you like to run or save regedit.exe '' 
 <unk> maybe i can do this as another user 
 start & gt run & gt cmd internet explorer pops open would you like to run or save <unk> '' 
 right cmd is an executable 
 ok so let 's try just doing runas from the run dialog because at least the run dialog works 
 start & gt run & gt runas <unk> : $ <unk> $ <unk> cmd internet explorer pops open would you like to run or save <unk> '' 
 this user is on a thin client connecting to a vm in a pool of possible <unk> 
 so i said well this machine is hosed 
 no big i will log him off and put him on a new machine then we 'll just <unk> the old vm '' 
 so i logged him off and logged him back on to another machine 
 except ... the user preferences for file <unk> is in <unk> 
 which is part of the roaming profile 
 which <unk> with every machine you log into 
 finally i went back to my pc and created a <unk> file with the following contents : windows registry <unk> version <unk> <unk> i went back to the target computer and merged the <unk> file and that fixed <unk> i 'm currently contracting for a big company i 'm a sw engineering consultant so i move around a lot 
 all of a sudden the network share i use to access my linux home directory stops working 
 i went through my own troubleshooting steps * <unk> <unk> ~ '' - yup i did n't get moved to a different server i 've seen that in the past 
 * <unk> all my network <unk> * heck threw in a <unk> just for fun 
 * i even rebooted 
 * i even checked that i could map a coworkers home directory and he also could not map mine 
 so i 'm pretty sure it was not my issue 
 now i get to call it 
 i tell them what they have tried naturally they do n't trust me and i do n't really blame them from the stories i see here so they have me go through the same basic troubleshooting steps and finally gets can you try rebooting your pc '' 
 now it 's been a long day and i have multiple code windows open that i 'm working on and do n't feel like wasting 15 minutes shutting things down and getting everything back to the way it was when i was debugging my real work 
 so i ask him can you map my home directory from your machine '' 
 he says he does n't know if his machine has permissions to get to my group 
 so i ask him can you map my coworkers home directory 
 yes he can 
 now can you map my drive 
 no it did n't work 
 so i asked him have you tried rebooting your pc '' 
 first day back today from christmas and new year break 
 it has taken my manager all of an hour to quit 
 i 'm not actually sure what has happened but a user came up giving him grief for not sorting out her problem at about 9:30am which she <unk> yesterday on a sunday evening and no staff have been in at all since <unk> december 
 i just saw him <unk> to himself 'fuck this 
 sorted out his things stood up wished us all luck and has walked out 
 i 'm in a little bit of disbelief 
 1 user too far by the looks of things 
 edit : just thought i would add a follow up nothing exciting unfortunately 
 just spoke to him on the phone and there was no other reason than he realised he could n't put up with it anymore so he walked 
 he has had a few interviews recently anyway so he 's positive something will come up soon 
 other than that he 's done what i and a few others dream of but ca n't actually do and just walked 
 i wish him well 
 previous at the end of the second day with the young adults i sat in my office head in my hands staring at the floor 
 hours of mental <unk> including “do you think she likes me ” “whats her number ” “do you think she has a boyfriend ” had been <unk> out by badshirt all afternoon 
 i was already at my limit 
 redcheer knocked at the door 
 she too was looking warn out 
 & gt redcheer : can we swap back 
 defiant keeps just saying <unk> i can’t handle it 
 & gt me : oh please yes 
 badshirt has fallen in love with sassy a marketing girl 
 he won’t be quiet about it 
 so many questions… 
 redcheer smiled weakly and slumped herself <unk> in a chair 
 & gt redcheer : i think i can take the love talk its the complete c $ % p defiant says that i can’t take 
 & gt me : defiant only says stuff sometimes 
 badshirt never shuts his trap 
 actually wasn’t defiant with headhr all day 
 a knock at the door interrupted my questioning 
 solitaire was smiling brightly at the room 
 & gt solitaire : you two think you have it rough 
 ... my kid won’t even talk 
 solitaire started chuckling to himself 
 & gt solitaire : actually to be honest 
 hesitant is awesome we’re having great fun 
 anyway airz i was wondering if i could teach hesitant about the network <unk> just take a look inside the server room and a few networking <unk> 
 hesitant is pretty keen on networking 
 & gt me : yeah 
 <unk> whatever you want 
 i was too tired to care 
 the students had worn me out 
 ***** the next day defiant and badshirt turned up at my office 
 they both seemed surprised to see the other boy 
 & gt defiant : what are you doing here 
 & gt badshirt : airz swapped us 
 you’re now with the <unk> 
 badshirt pointed out through the door at redcheer 
 she looked wreaked 
 i couldn’t bring myself to lump a kid on her today 
 & gt me : actually… no 
 you’re both with me today 
 lets look at the ticket queue 
 & gt badshirt : but i wanted to talk to you <unk> 
 you know who… <unk> 
 i grinned realising badshirt couldn’t talk about sassy with defiant around 
 today might actually be okay… 
 i opened to ticket queue 
 **new ticket** & gt *could we get an it staff member to help shuffle some of the computers in sales 
 we need to move a few desks 
 * <unk> my grin turned into a smile as i looked at the two young men in front of me 
 moving <unk> 
 no problem 
 ***** walking up to the sales floor i told the boys what we would be doing defiant started <unk> about the manual labor 
 & gt defiant : we’re it 
 <unk> <unk> 
 & gt me : don’t worry you just have to move the computers and connect them up 
 it jobs 
 <unk> arriving at the floor the sales manager rushes over 
 she greeted us with a huge smile 
 & gt salesmng : oh great 
 you’ve brought some helpers too 
 okay we just need to move all these computers from here… to over there and set them all up ready to work 
 the sales manager points to a pile of computers on the floor and a bunch of desks over the other side of the large room 
 & gt me : any particular <unk> 
 & gt salesmng : nope 
 defiant and badshirt then got to work moving all the computers and setting them up 
 i attempted to help but i got bored rather quickly 
 badshirt seemed to be working hard defiant on the other hand was going <unk> slow 
 i tried encouraging him but my shouts from a chair didn’t seem to help 
 eventually all the computers were to be moved and everything was plugged in 
 & gt defiant : we’re missing some <unk> input devices 
 & gt me : wha… 
 & gt badshirt : keyboards 
 we’re missing like… 
 four keyboards 
 i looked around but couldn’t see any keyboards spare 
 the sales manager however arrived and started praising the boys efforts 
 & gt salesmng : oh my 
 so fast you two are such good workers 
 i can’t believe you’re finished already 
 & gt defiant : we’re not done yet 
 some keyboards have gone missing 
 salesmanager looked puzzled but shrugged it off quickly 
 & gt salesmng : don’t worry about that 
 they’ll turn up 
 you should go get yourselves a drink after all that hard work ... & gt defiant : we can’t leave a job half <unk> & gt badshirt : come on defiant i’m thirsty 
 badshirt dragged defiant over to the break room that sales manager was pointing out 
 sales manager turned back to talk to me 
 & gt salesmng : have you checked all the cabling 
 & gt me : looks right to me 
 i glanced at the computers everything seemed like it was plugged in correctly 
 & gt salesmng : you got ta check them all 
 i saw the kids put them together so you got ta make sure they did it right 
 & gt me : not really much to screw up but… okay… i walked over to the computers and checked them 
 they were all fine 
 & gt me : yep 
 they all look good 
 the sales manager didn’t look happy that my checks only took a few moments she walked over to the first computer and pressed the power button 
 i heard it whir 
 & gt salesmng : you didn’t check these computers at all 
 the screen isn’t even working… sales manager walked around to the back of the computer and started inspecting the wires 
 i however walked over to the front of the computer… & gt me : you just need to turn on the screen 
 i pressed the power for the screen and the computer <unk> with <unk> the sales manager started stammering 
 & gt salesmng : <unk> well… good 
 but i don’t want to have to check them all myself 
 check them properly 
 & gt me : don’t worry 
 i have 
 i started shouting 
 & gt me : defiant badshirt come on 
 we’re going back to it 
 sales manager looked incensed as i started walking away 
 she didn’t seem to want to call me out in front of the children so she said the only thing she could… 
 & gt salesmng : oh airz 
 could we get another box of <unk> i didn’t stop walking 
 next short one which happened not 15 minutes ago 
 those of you that work on <unk> and/or operations can most likely relate to this one 
 users have a tendency to call for issues with their accounts when they inevitably enter the wrong password one too many times 
 when their password expires and anything else they can come up with they 're pretty <unk> 
 so here i am sitting at my desk when the phone rings 
 caller id is a lady from eastern europe let 's call her $ lee 
 and she has trouble with her account 
 normally speaking during the day this is a job for the helpdesk but it 's been a pretty slow day and i 'm strangely enough in a good mood 
 & gt $ me : hello this is it how may i help you today 
 & gt $ lee : i think my account is locked out 
 & gt $ me : ok could you provide me your account 
 i 'll take a look 
 & gt $ lee : it 's $ <unk> goes to look up user account no issues found except the password being past the required changing date 
 bingo '' 
 & gt $ me : alright i see here that your account is not locked nor is it expired 
 however i see here that your password needs to be changed 
 could you check this please 
 & gt $ lee : no that 's not right 
 that 's not what the error message says 
 & gt $ me : could you please read me the error message 
 & gt $ lee : the password of your account has expired and must be <unk> ... thank you click '' penny dropped 
 previous as i looked down at the busted remains of a screen i thought about just revoking computer rights 
 coffee in hand i was hoping for a firing 
 the sales representative whose computer it was looked up at me 
 he was wearing dark sunglasses inside 
 he was weird 
 & gt sun : its broken 
 & gt me : yep 
 the screen an lcd had its glass cracked some words where showing on some of the <unk> most where black 
 & gt me : so… what happened to it 
 sun looked up at me the glasses made his expression unreadable 
 & gt sun : errr 
 don’t worry i think i know whats wrong with it 
 & gt me : oh the screen 
 a clearly broken screen and the gentleman with sunglasses knows whats <unk> brilliant 
 i took a sip of coffee 
 & gt sun : it needs <unk> 
 my coffee almost <unk> out of my mouth 
 only years of coffee experience kept it in 
 & gt me : sorry what 
 the sales floor manager walked over and looked down at the screen 
 unimpressed 
 good 
 & gt sun : i looked it up 
 my monitor was a bit <unk> so i followed the <unk> & gt me : sorry… 
 your lcd needed degaussing so you followed some online instructions 
 & gt sun : it said to look for a <unk> button but since you guy’s probably bought the cheapest model 
 it didn’t have one 
 i looked over at the manager 
 hopefully i’m not the only one enjoy this comedy of errors 
 the sales manager looked confused more for me then 
 & gt sun : but the internet said magnets sometimes both caused and could fix the problem 
 i took a sip of my coffee tasted like an idiot 
 & gt me : so you… got the magnet and it made it worse 
 & gt sun : i think i swirled the wrong way or something because now my <unk> black 
 sales manager looked up at me and decided she’d seen enough 
 & gt sales : we should probably get this working now 
 & gt me : its a broken monitor it’ll need <unk> just as i was about to launch into my speech about how this user should be separated from technology i was interrupted by the <unk> wearing idiot 
 & gt sun : oh my 
 it’s an <unk> 
 he pointed over at his colleagues computer the oldest worker at sales 
 he’d turned on <unk> to look at some things 
 & gt sun : that 's what mine was doing see the <unk> 
 & gt me : magnification 
 & gt sun : how can he work like that 
 & gt me : hey errrrr… i tapped the older gentleman on the shoulder did you use sunglasses computer recently 
 & gt old : oh yes 
 mine didn’t have a keyboard and i needed to look something up real quick 
 & gt me : see sunglasses your magnification was turned on your monitor didn’t need degaussing 
 the sales manager looked like she’d had enough 
 & gt sales : okay sun you didn’t need to use the magnet just go <unk> the magnet the other way to make it go back 
 then turn off magnification 
 & gt me : that <unk> 
 & gt sales : … <unk> sales had a smile on her face 
 the smile was wide 
 sunglasses was swirling the magnet over the screen clockwise 
 & gt sales : you better be sure that 's the right way 
 & gt sun : it is 
 it is 
 & gt sales : keep swirling 
 i want this monitor working again fast 
 i couldn’t believe sales manager was having fun with this 
 we walked away from sunglasses who was swirling away 
 & gt sales : hahaha that was fun 
 & gt me : you know that’ll never work though right 
 & gt sales : do you think i’m a moron 
 eventually he’ll just go replace it no work for you 
 & gt me : saving me work how nice 
 i took a sip of my coffee 
 tasted weird 
 & gt sales : vp’s secretary sent me an email saying not to mess up it so much 
 tasted really weird 
 & gt me : <unk> 
 & gt sales : i think they’re trying to pull down your budget or something 
 & gt me : did they say that 
 & gt sales : well no… 
 but why else would they tell everyone not to mess with it 
 everyone knows vp doesn’t like you too much 
 maybe he’s trying to cut your budget by making it look like you don’t spend it all 
 & gt me : huh 
 & gt sales : so with that line of <unk> i took another sip of my coffee 
 here it comes 
 & gt sales : could we get another box of keyboards 
 this time my years of coffee experience couldn’t keep the coffee down 
 coffee <unk> over everything 
 <unk> next i 'm a one man repair band and today i got a call from a new customer that was short confusing and i thought worthy of this sub 
 & gt **lcp** : hello this is lcp how can i help you 
 & gt **old guy** : do you fix ram 's 
 & gt **lcp** : yes i do what 's wrong 
 & gt **old guy** : my bluetooth wo n't connect 
 i 've had my fair share of elderly folks that mix and <unk> technologies and use the entirely wrong <unk> 
 the only solution is ask more questions 
 & gt **lcp** : what kind of computer is it 
 & gt **old guy** : i do n't know i think it 's just a stereo 
 & gt **lcp** : so you ca n't connect to the stereo 
 & gt **old guy** : correct 
 & gt **lcp** : what kind of stereo is it 
 & gt **old guy** : it 's in my ram the one that comes with it 
 it finally hits me when he says <unk> my <unk> 
 & gt **lcp** : do you mean ram like the truck 
 & gt **old guy** : yeah 
 & gt **lcp** : i 'm sorry i thought you meant a component in the computer yes i can troubleshoot the bluetooth in your dodge ram 
 i continued to get more info and will be troubleshooting it next week 
 first post on tfts but i 'll post some more if people want to hear them 
 im 23 in my first job in it working <unk> line support in a school 
 we have about 400 staff and 1500 <unk> with a lovely 3 it tech team of me my colleague and uni friend and our boss who 's a great guy 
 get a ticket comes in today & gt * '' $ student ca n't open files and she needs to print for coursework assignment 
 * okey <unk> so this is either dead usb or weird file format 
 head over to the dept thinking its probably just something like an open office doc or google docs been saved in a weird format 
 teacher shows me the files and its in a <unk> & gt '' ok so this is n't something i <unk> i 'll just take it back to the office and see what i can do '' 
 now im only 23 so not all that familiar with all the obscure legacy file formats but a quick bit of <unk> later it turns out to be from microsoft works which i might add was discontinued 8 years ago 2007 
 just open them with word save as and now they have <unk> <unk> <unk> head back over and give the usb to the teacher all is dandy & gt * '' thanks $ <unk> you 're a life <unk> '' * have a quick talk to the girl who seems non <unk> that works is n't all that normal anymore 
 oh well problem solved 
 some time later in the office $ teacher comes in and says thanks for helping and said the girl was really worried all her work was gone 
 & gt '' why would she think that 
 all the stuff was there '' & gt * '' her family are incredibly hard up and she was scared she was going to have to get her parents to buy something '' * & gt '' for <unk> 
 can you possibly go and get her and i 'll tell her what she needs '' few mins pass and $ teacher returns with $ <unk> who has a worried look on her face & gt '' hey so $ teacher tells me you dont have the newest stuff you need for work '' & gt * '' no but im not good at computers i was scared all my work was gone and i did n't know what to do '' * & gt no problems thats why i have a job so about your work 
 in future you can use this cool bit of software called open office 
 works exactly the same as ms word also ms works i guess and you 've got your <unk> and excel if you need it and the best part is its all free 
 ** & gt * '' oh that sounds good how can i get it 
 * so i <unk> down the name of what she wants the url and show her on my screen where to click on the <unk> site and run her through the next next next spam when you install 
 & gt * '' so i need to download it at home 
 * & gt '' yeah all the info is on the <unk> i just gave you any problems give me a shout '' & gt * '' oh errr 
 i dont have internet at home '' * : *at this point shes looking really sad i can tell it was quite uncomfortable telling me this* & gt '' why did n't you say so 
 let me just grab a flash drive '' i proceed to notice her usb stick is one of the free <unk> promo ones some companies give out 
 so i grab one out of stock download the installer for her and stick it on the new flash drive then inform her that she can keep the stick if she wants *we inventory them at pretty much nothing because we get through so many although they 're all decent 8gb <unk> at this point she just broke down in tears and was just saying thank you over and over again and how she was so worried about telling her mum and thought they could n't afford it 
 she stayed around for about <unk> whilst she <unk> her composure and she honestly seemed interested in what we get up to before she thanked us again and left <unk> through a school of 2000 kids with red eyes is social <unk> just made me realise how lucky i am even having a computer and internet connection when i get home and gives you a real insight in to other peoples lives at the telco i work for there <unk> a policy for call centers whenever a customer acted <unk> 
 no matter how bad it got everyone from sales to techs was supposed to politely explain that unless they calm down we would terminate the conversation after three warnings 
 in case of repeat offenses service could be terminated 
 whole thing was meant to give frontline a way to cleanly terminate calls from abusive customers once attempts to calm them down failed - but intent does n't always translate to documentation 
 part of the procedure after terminating a call this way is to send up a ticket with a short explanation of what happened for possible review 
 usually that 's documentation for it 's own sake 
 as tech senior staff i get alerts on a ton of things i am not really expected to take action on including flags that tickets have been filed in <unk> to this policy commonly called icbp tickets 
 few months ago i got one i actually wanted to investigate 
 the incident description read * '' icbp - customer would n't stop crying despite the three warnings had to terminate call as per policy 
 * <unk> 
 ** so i logged into the call monitoring software found the call an <unk> arduous process really the tools suck and listened 
 the customer was indeed panicking and crying but certainly not in a threatening or aggressive way 
 sending emergency help would have been more appropriate than terminating the call 
 more importantly it was entirely our fault 
 her ticket history showed she called us several times for help with a <unk> ingress issue and that she still had severe packet loss 
 by the letter of the policy and considering how it 's explained in basic training i could n't truly fault the frontline tech for terminating this call - though i certainly <unk> his common sense and the policy itself 
 intermittent electrical noise issues are notoriously hard to fix and there are sometimes long delays but in her case it was downright ridiculous 
 she had called us every two weeks for over six months without a fix nor even a single escalation to senior staff 
 she endured a randomly utterly useless internet connection 35 % + packet loss about a third of the time 
 she eventually stopped paying her bill after telling us *in <unk> she 'd pay up everything once it was fixed 
 instead of helping it got her file sent to recoveries - the department tasked with recovering debts from non-paying customers acting in bad faith 
 they have leeway to negotiate depending on the situation but somehow the person handling her case skipped the <unk> and went nuclear right out of the gate threatening her with escalating her non payment to all major credit rating agencies 
 that 's usually a <unk> effort before they resort to <unk> the account which means reporting the black mark to <unk> and selling the bad debt to an external recovery agency 
 either of which means your life will likely suck 
 so i 'm just sitting there looking at one screen showing in real time that she has 33 % packet loss on the second a huge list of <unk> tech support tickets and on the third that she 's <unk> <unk> by recoveries for not paying for nine weeks - even though it usually takes a year for <unk> <unk> to earn this status .. all while listening to the call where we hung up on her for crying after she had just been threatened with <unk> her life 
 some panic was <unk> - recoveries was basically saying she would not be able to renew her mortgage at market rates because we spent months not providing the service she paid for 
 i first called fellow senior staff over at recoveries 
 & gt bytewave : hey bytewave from tech support 's senior staff i 'm calling to have your recoveries file closed for $ account all procedures to be suspended '' 
 & gt recoveries : huh we do have a file open for this account but it 's not in the red 
 there 's actually a positive credit of several hundred bucks no debt 
 wait there was just a huge credit applied <unk> '' & gt bytewave : yes that 's me 
 just applied full credit for over half a year to this customer 's account dating back to the first time she contacted us about an ongoing technical issue 
 as per policy tsss is allowed to grant credit for any issue we deem major if it persists past 72 hours after initial report from a customer 
 also just added a note to the account for documentation '' 
 & gt recoveries : huh i do n't get that everyday over six months really 
 closing our file just now 
 what the hell happened '' 
 & gt bytewave : on the tech side of things i 'll handle it 
 on yours i have no idea how this got escalated so quickly to <unk> threats 
 can you look into it - and have someone who is allowed to leave a brief message explaining that all is well <unk> '' 
 & gt recoveries : on it 
 thanks for the heads up '' 
 senior staff are n't allowed to talk directly to customers as per union rules as direct contact is frontline 's job description 
 i never got the skinny on why they basically went nuclear almost immediately but a few minutes later i saw through the hardline troubleshooting tools that there was an apologetic voicemail explaining that the account was in the black from one of their guys 
 then i got to networks senior staff 
 the department in charge of making sure ingress issues do n't last for over half a year ... & gt bytewave : hey bit of a situation in node <unk> ongoing for over half a year 
 i looked at the network tickets and all i see are excuses and delays all written from <unk> accounts 
 what the hell is happening there '' 
 <unk> accounts ... internal employees write tickets under their own names you can tell instantly who did what 
 contractors accounts however use <unk> accounts that are hard but not impossible to trace back to the tech who actually did the job 
 & gt networks : oh that 
 we do n't have anyone in that node it 's all handled by our <unk> network contractor 
 according to everything i have despite <unk> attempts they were never able to replicate the issue while on site or pinpoint cause 
 but you 're right that has been ongoing way too long '' 
 & gt bytewave : so send one of our guys to confirm and verify 
 closest depot <unk> less than a hundred miles out but given <unk> '' & gt networks : .. yeah that 's not so easy nowadays 
 boss do n't like approving <unk> work the union benefits for <unk> are too generous or something 
 we can lean on the contractors though '' 
 & gt bytewave : we 're well past that 
 i 'll send your boss the audio recording of this conversation if you want 
 where i 'm hereby stating that i just applied a 1200 $ credit to a single customer 's account for gross failure of service over the last 6 months and that tsss <unk> do the same for everyone with similar ongoing ingress issues in this node 
 we 're talking several dozens - all of which we 'll file under the 'major network failure code '' 
 the guy chuckled and soon after union network techs went out there 
 credits filed for 'major network failure go back to <unk> budget if they ca n't reasonably explain it was n't their fault after a sla is busted - and it was by literally over 6 months 
 it took networks two trips out there to pinpoint and fix the source of ingress because of the intermittent nature of the issue but somehow i doubt that explains why the previous 16 contractor attempts yielded zero results 
 this left open the issue of the actual ticket in front of me where a tech legitimately hung up on a customer because she was crying 
 sadly and common sense aside it was literally what he was taught to do in basic training 
 & gt bytewave : boss i need to add something to <unk> for the next tsss meeting ... '' a couple weeks later at the tsss meeting we had to debate my motion to edit the <unk> <unk> customer behavior policy so it would apply only to customers who are <unk> angry or threatening 
 frontline should n't be allowed nor required to hang up on someone just desperate for help 
 duh 
 ... but <unk> common sense is never easy 
 after a short discussion tsss agreed that it should change but the process for editing <unk> policies is slow 
 right now tech support is allowed to take context into account while sales and recoveries are still supposed to hang up on you for crying after three warnings 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 the week came to its natural conclusion over several <unk> of spilt milk and the mandated amount of crying 
 several more instances of angie 's managerial style being put into action came and went 
 however i still had tickets building up which needed build area time 
 realising bhit was ineffective in offering a solution i tried and failed to <unk> third line into <unk> some of their server room space for machine builds 
 i turned my attention to our <unk> more than amenable post-room guys 
 but it seems i was slightly pushing it at the prospect of <unk> our server in there 
 the request was met with more displeasure at our storing new laptops and bags in there already 
 the answer flooded towards me one day when angie fat finance wench unnaturally skinny finance wench and the hr tank took off for their near twice daily trip to starbucks 
 i heard them <unk> about their new coffee related discovery on their way out 
 see they have to take baby steps otherwise hr tank will break out in <unk> of sweat 
 but so i hear ginger shots in lattes are simply <unk> 
 angie 's <unk> change in personality between her <unk> with us and her friends still resonated around the team with astonishment 
 it was just odd to hear this <unk> do nothing but treat us like shit all day but then with friends actually smile and be human 
 but my time came to put my <unk> fuck you '' plan into action 
 like batman with a purpose i ran round the office building like a thing <unk> 
 i had a third <unk> retrieve our <unk> ghost server from the network riser room and patched up some network ports 
 i finished phase 1 of my mission with an email to angie requesting several parts from the it cupboard just as she returned stinking of coffee and <unk> 
 she accepted my request with a <unk> but <unk> managerial style 
 monday morning 
 car <unk> it 's time to get the hammers on 
 i 'm at work early for phase 2. quiet blonde girl qbg always seemed to fly under angie 's radar 
 i did initially suspect her to be our rat as she has a <unk> to be popular with higher up types 
 though i would say a lot of that would be <unk> 
 her arrival in helpdesk was a little perplexing as nobody - not even the helpdesk manager - had even interviewed her 
 similarly her record quick transfer to 2nd line was equally enigmatic 
 i think we were just lucky that qbg was actually a decent worker and learned quickly 
 <unk> 
 personally i think more <unk> 
 all <unk> of her being a mole were slightly <unk> one lunch hour when she launched into a seething verbal attack about angie the sort of stuff that had it ever been heard by anyone with power would have definitely landed qbg with her <unk> the <unk> 
 however monday was to be her day 
 she had done some extraordinarily terrible thing and it was time for her to feel angie 's wrath 
 and female to good looking female angie was in no way going to let her off lightly 
 but i was ready and waiting for angie 
 angie with qbg in tow opened door to her <unk> of <unk> with an angered and authoritative <unk> 
 she stood in the doorway sideways motioning for qbg to enter 
 her attention was soon diverted 
 there was i several machines imaging on top of the file cabinets two further machines lay <unk> on the table and a <unk> and official amount of paperwork lay with my blue <unk> nestled neatly on top 
 i said with a slightly <unk> and victorious tone can i help you at all '' 
 angie 's face turned red as a small vein on the side of her temple <unk> leaving qbg outside she closed the door and turned her attention to me 
 her <unk> was echoed in the warming meeting room amidst the blur of machines 
 who gave you permission to do this '' 
 my short simple reply amounted to nobody i used my initiative 
 we have no build areas anymore customers are waiting on their machines '' 
 knowing that there was nothing she could do she left the room with i 'll be checking on you later 
 as the door closed it was obvious qbg had returned to her desk assuming she had escaped <unk> 
 no such luck 
 angie 's <unk> <unk> played out as she called across to her in a way one would talk to a 5 year old with a simple hey you 
 here '' 
 as her bony finger pointed downwards 
 qbg obliged with this demand as angie simply stated this one is taken come with me '' the door closed completely leaving only me and my machines 
 i felt like some sort of mad professor finally alone in my domain 
 angie was <unk> 
 i relaxed in my new man-cave all manner of <unk> going on 
 mafg even swung by minutes later for a victorious <unk> the smiles from other team members shining through the open door like <unk> 
 i think i just further angered angie more when i came out to the team that the room has been booked all week but there 's plenty space 
 feel free to use it back to business as usual 
 i think it was the last part 
 angie 's hand froze as she <unk> moved the mouse around the screen in her attempts to find the outlook icon again 
 in a way i did sort of feel sorry for angie 
 my girlfriend 's <unk> of a lone female trying to make it in man 's world resonated a little 
 that was until she turned around and demanded we kept the noise down people are trying to work 
 her snap only <unk> her <unk> 
 though something told me that i had n't heard the last of this 
 one thing you will learn too about women in positions of power who are n't cut out for the job 
 they always win 
 no matter how much you think you 've had the upper hand they still win 
 i returned to my desk to reply to some emails leaving my machines image in my cave claimed in the name of man 
 i could n't help <unk> wonder if this would eventually be qbg 's fate socially promoted as guys in positions of power like the eye candy until she gets to a stage where she is truly out of her depth only able to rely on her position of authority to <unk> her staff 
 as it happens i was dead right 
 my moment of victory was surprisingly cut short ... **previous** in my job i support servers 
 the typical client that i talk to over the phone is an sa with several years of industry experience and multiple <unk> 
 in short i do n't have the privilege of dealing with <unk> users very often 
 tfts being my favorite subreddit i 've always wanted the opportunity to have a story worth telling here and recently like <unk> from heaven that opportunity presented itself 
 the call went something like this : me : thank you for calling <unk> how can i help 
 her : i just changed my isp and now my workstations wo n't connect to the internet 
 me : i 'm sorry to hear that ma'am 
 you 've actually reached server support but if you 'll hold for a minute i 'll get you down to our workstation guys ... her : no 
 this is obviously a server problem 
 something is wrong with my domain controller and now my workstations ca n't connect to the internet 
 at this point i decided <unk> the hell 
 it was a slow day might as well dig into this and once we prove it is n't the server maybe we can figure out what the problem is 
 i check out the server and everything looks fine 
 i then turn my attention to the workstations 
 me : ok ma'am i want to walk you through checking a few basic things on your workstation 
 <unk> instructions on checking her ipv4 <unk> 
 can you tell me what the settings are 
 her : the ip address is <unk> etc 
 etc ... the preferred dns server is <unk> me : <unk> you said the dns is <unk> 
 that does n't sound right to me ... her : well yeah 
 this is workstation 2. me : so ... what is the preferred dns for workstation 1 
 her : <unk> should n't you know this 
 me : ma'am ... it does n't really work that way 
 we need to reconfigure these 
 her : that ca n't be right - workstation # 8 works just fine 
 it was very very difficult for me not to laugh 
 we got her straightened out but this was quite possibly the funniest call i 've had in years 
 previous annoyed bitter angry 
 all in the first hour of returning to work in this personal hell 
 why did i return here 
 the vp <unk> my footsteps as i made my way into the bigp’s office 
 & gt bigp : airz 
 you got my message 
 oh… vp had followed me into the room 
 bigp’s face had lit up in surprise 
 & gt bigp : vp what are you doing here 
 i suddenly remembered the note the bigp had left in my office telling me to come see him 
 & gt vp : just here <unk> sit in 
 the bigp was fast 
 however this development threw even him entirely 
 he sat in silence for several seconds 
 i almost launched into a tirade about he vp’s incompetence then but i thought it would be better in private 
 & gt bigp : why 
 again i almost boiled over in rage at the vp’s terrible management i considered it might be better to hear his counter arguments however it may <unk> the… <unk> 
 & gt vp : i feel it would be better if i was here 
 & gt bigp : oh 
 well i don’t 
 so 
 leave 
 shocked at the <unk> of the bigp i realized i hadn’t actually seen them argue before 
 the vp looked annoyed his eyes looked to be calculating his options 
 & gt vp : but you don’t know what he’s about to say 
 the bigp <unk> forward in his chair his eyes darted between both myself and the vp 
 & gt bigp : is there something i should know 
 vp’s eyes went from calculating to panicked 
 i opened my mouth to start my speech on mismanagement 
 & gt vp : yes 
 beaten to the punch 
 i decided i should hear his version of events to look professional before slamming him to the <unk> 
 & gt vp : see some computers were damaged by rain 
 & gt bigp : <unk> badly 
 again i opened my mouth to answer but the vp was in <unk> fire mode 
 & gt vp : destroyed actually 
 & gt bigp : destroyed 
 & gt vp : yes 
 it was mostly my fault 
 my mouth went into an oh shape 
 the vp admitting fault 
 what is this world coming to 
 & gt vp : i apologize i stupidly left some computers in the dock which flooded 
 destroying the computers 
 & gt me : you left them for a week 
 horribly <unk> 
 the bigp looked very serious he gave a very grave face before continuing 
 & gt bigp : destroying equipment especially from a department you insisted on managing whilst airz was away is terrible 
 what disciplinary action do you believe is appropriate airz 
 i opened my mouth whilst thinking up an appropriate punishment for destroying <unk> worth of equipment 
 before i could say <unk> <unk> 
 the vp’s fast mouth beat me to the punch again 
 & gt vp : i didn’t actually destroy any of airz departments equipment 
 & gt bigp : you destroyed computers they’re it equipment 
 & gt vp : yes and no 
 they were new but since airz <unk> me from spending any it budget on that <unk> upgrade the money came from my own budget 
 in terms of punishment i think if i can not produce the cost of computers through cost cutting or <unk> additional sales i shall either be sacked or pay for the difference from my own money 
 that punishment didn’t ring fair to my ears 
 & gt bigp : double 
 you need to find double the cost of computers in either additional cost cutting or sales 
 or else you’re fired 
 you have… 
 6 months 
 & gt me : but isn’t that his normal job anyway 
 the bigp gave me a massive smile 
 his eyes looked like they held back knowledge 
 & gt bigp : extra <unk> 
 also since it’s no money from it doesn’t matter to you right 
 although the vp probably owes it a <unk> for being so good during his tenure as it head 
 right 
 vp’s head was nodding up and down so fast i thought it might fall off 
 a secretary knocked on the door and told the bigp an appointment had arrived 
 & gt bigp : sorry to cut this short 
 however if you don’t think this is fair airz we can discuss it later today at 6. meeting room 
 head of hr and the company lawyer will be there too 
 & gt vp : you can’t discuss these things without me 
 & gt bigp : that’s why you’ll be there too 
 6pm 
 the bigp walked out of his office rather swiftly 
 next to me the vp let out a long breath i didn’t realize he was holding 
 i got up from my chair walked over to the door 
 half turned around and gave the vp the biggest smile 
 & gt me : see you at 6. let the countdown begin 
 : next my mother was finally convinced to upgrade from her <unk> windows xp pc when the local tv 11 <unk> news did a story on how hackers will be able to empty out <unk> and hold your files ransom with encryption 
 she bought a new pc running windows 8. i get a phone call that she keeps getting stuck '' while using her new pc 
 i come over later in the day 
 let me show you '' 
 she sits <unk> on the internet explorer tile types google '' into the search bar on yahoo.com clicks search types aol mail '' into google search clicks search moves the cursor over the bottom arrow in the scroll bar and clicks it many times until an e-mail with a .pdf attachment is visible 
 she hits the open button on the attachment and a full screen pdf reader presents some letter 
 see 
 there no way to get out of this 
 the same thing happens when i run any other program except for internet '' 
 she pushes the power button and then pushes it again to turn on the pc to get a start screen on the monitor 
 windows 8 does indeed boot very fast 
 i had to search for an answer on how to switch between programs get back to somewhere i can launch programs from and generally navigate without <unk> <unk> visual <unk> such as window buttons <unk> or start menus 
 and then i asked myself whether this would make sense to her 
 i thought to myself shit '' 
 it looks like i 'll be giving her a copy of windows 7 as a gift <unk> is n't so much a bad user as an amusing circumstance 
 we have one office in mexico with a half dozen <unk> users 
 usually a manager who also speaks english can assist us in tech support and the users know enough to enable remote support and usually enough english to describe a problem 
 i had this amusing exchange over instant message : <unk> user : ** no print 
 i attempted to fix the problem and replied : **me : ** print 
 : - **her : ** print : - i tried another fix and asked **me : ** print 
 : - **her : ** print : - third try : **me : ** print 
 : - **her : ** print 
 : - <unk> 
 tl dr : language barrier : <unk> 
 edit : thanks everybody - i 'm glad ya 'll like this story 
 previous as i sat down at my desk i felt sympathy for the teachers of the world 
 marking was horrible 
 everyone complains when you do it and you never get a compliment for a good job just universal disdain 
 i sat down to a coffee in my office 
 delicious coffee keeping me sane 
 a knock at the door woke me from my daydream 
 solitaire entered the office 
 & gt sol : i just wanted to have a chat about how much some things are worth 
 & gt me : oh for goodness <unk> 
 & gt sol : oh no wasn’t a complaint 
 just wanted to know why you’ve set password resets at ten minutes 
 my coffee demanded to be thrown at solitaire 
 i decided against it 
 & gt me : how long… should they take 
 & gt sol : is there a zero option 
 i looked down at the drop down menu it didn’t have a zero option 
 & gt me : sadly not 
 solitaire looked at me his eyes slowly working up the courage to continue 
 & gt sol : as you know its a four way tie between itsec colourblind hockey and myself 
 i looked down at the current number sheet he was right all four where pretty close and far ahead 
 i was almost dead last mostly because choosing times for these tickets was eating time 
 & gt me : sooo 
 & gt sol : well we’re all <unk> out on the ticket box 
 waiting for the next ticket to come in and instantly taking it… 
 i took another sip of my coffee i couldn’t bring myself to care 
 & gt sol : but since you’re grading them in batches hockey has setup a packet sniffer in the comms room so he knows exactly when you’re marking some 
 my coffee decided it was time to wake up and start caring 
 & gt me : so <unk> going through all my traffic 
 solitaire gave me a sheepish look 
 & gt sol : i just want everything to be fair 
 & gt me : sol take the afternoon off go enjoy yourself 
 solitaire looked down at his watch it was early 
 very early 
 & gt sol : but i… 
 & gt me : no no i insist 
 a paid afternoon off what could be better 
 & gt sol : <unk> the look in his eyes said he wanted to argue more but a free afternoon off was slowly changing his mind 
 i decided to walk solitaire out of my office and went to go have a chat with hockey 
 i sipped my coffee en route 
 hockey was sitting at his desk staring at his many posters surrounding his work space 
 & gt hoc : airz 
 hey just waiting on some more tickets 
 he gave me a smile coffee was telling me to remember he was a good employee 
 & gt me : i hear you’ve been sniffing through my packets 
 <unk> smile slid off his face 
 he had an attempt at a contrite face 
 & gt hoc : sorry but… & gt me : you know i should fire you like… right now 
 & gt hoc : in my defense i can hardly get any tickets colour-blind has set up a script to pull tickets as soon as they come up 
 it checks every <unk> seconds 
 the only way i could compete is because his box would fill up with five i was getting the left <unk> 
 & gt me : so your answer was to go through potentially confidential traffic 
 & gt hoc : huh 
 & gt me : arn’t you packet sniffing my computer 
 & gt hoc : no 
 … 
 i’ve a sniffer on the ticketing server telling me when you login so i know about when new tickets will be marked 
 & gt me : that 's all you got 
 & gt hoc : ill show you… after looking through his setup i realized he was just looking for my login 
 coffee told me to let this one go 
 & gt hoc : i 'm sorry but i 'm just trying to make everything fair… i can’t compete otherwise 
 & gt me : you seem pretty stressed about it 
 & gt hoc : i am 
 colour-blind has a huge advantage you should tell him to cut it out at least my way only tells me when you’ve posted more 
 his just takes everything 
 & gt me : you should take the afternoon off 
 so you can <unk> - stress 
 & gt hoc : but i … 
 & gt me : no no i insist 
 a paid afternoon off what could be better 
 & gt hoc : <unk> 
 & gt me : or we could spend the afternoon going through every security breach you’ve <unk> 
 in detail 
 & gt hoc : bye 
 i took a sip of coffee 
 too easy 
 almost <unk> easy 
 time to see colour-blind 
 next many many years ago i helped run a support line for these custom medical testing work stations our company assembled 
 these particular devices were used to test memory and part of those tests required an <unk> component 
 one day i got a rather irate call from a client saying something like : & gt the machine is producing no sound 
 this is unacceptable 
 i have the patient waiting here and we have wasted almost an hour already with your system 
 if you ca n't resolve these issues we will be forced to consider legal action / find a new vendor 
 so i personally had worked on building these machines and knew most of their quirks 
 a completely working system <unk> the sound made absolutely no sense 
 i spent about 20 minutes running through some basic diagnostics asking the user about the speaker power cable speaker audio cable volume levels etc 
 the user was getting very annoyed at me for asking such basic questions 
 apparently i had insulted them 
 they were an important doctor after all 
 the issue was definitely with our system 
 why was i not believing him 
 frustrated myself i asked for the third or fourth time ... & gt *me* are you sure the volume knob on the speaker is all the way up 
 & gt *user* of course the volume is up 
 i know how to use a computer 
 with no obvious solutions i grasp at a straw and say ... & gt *me* okay 
 well what happens if you turn the volume all the way down 
 at this point i can hear the background test audio for our application blast over the phone 
 i hear a bit of a <unk> from the other side of the line and the sound quickly goes dead again 
 & gt *user* hey hold on a minute 
 a few moments pass 
 & gt *user* listen something just came up here and i have to go 
 if we ca n't get this fixed in the next day i 'll call you back 
 never heard from them again 
 this reminded me of a time i did a bit of showing off 
 i 'm a <unk> engineer on big <unk> 
 i love it the work is incredibly varied and i get to travel around the world 
 but this tale is n't about how wonderful the job is 
 it 's normal for us to have a <unk> or two on board 
 these guys are training to become officers 
 generally <unk> years old pretty green as you 'd expect and to begin with at least very much like a fish out of water 
 one of the tasks that we 're required to be able to do is bring a generator online and connect it to the ship 's switchboard 
 with modern tech it 's perfectly possible to just press a button and the computer will do it for you but we need to be able to do it by hand in case it goes wrong 
 the switchboards are all 3 phase ac 
 so in order to connect a generator you need to start it synchronise the <unk> of the switchboard and incoming generator and then connect the breaker 
 once connected you need to balance the load so all machines are taking <unk> the same 
 it 's not that straightforward but given a bit of practice it 's easy enough 
 we were talking the <unk> through doing this 
 one of them was particularly nervous - after all if you screw it up then the lights go out 
 and i said as an off the cuff <unk> something along the lines of : & gt it 's easy i could do it blindfolded to which the immediate answer is : & gt go on then 
 so i did 
 with a rag tied over my eyes and standing in front of the switchboard i started <unk> connected and load balanced a generator 
 the other engineer and the <unk> were <unk> as to how i 'd managed it - because on the face of it you have to be able to see all the <unk> and power meters to be able to do it even if you could find all the buttons 
 so how did i manage it 
 simply the engineer 's secret weapon : by listening carefully 
 1. the switchboard was right above the <unk> so once they 're running you can hear the difference in running speeds as <unk> 
 a <unk> of <unk> <unk> wave interference 
 that got the incoming machine close in frequency 
 2. listen for the click of the <unk> check relay 
 that 's the one that prevents you connecting them when they 're out of sync 
 when it clicks you know it 's safe to connect 
 3. hit the button 
 4. load balance by listening carefully to the noise from the <unk> 
 a turbo 's speed is <unk> to engine load 
 when the whistle is about the same they 're both loaded equally 
 of course i did n't tell them this 
 i just grinned and said 
 & gt i 'm that good 
 now your turn 
 we have a unique to our industry software product that <unk> a lot of time @ 80 % for our users buying a certain market product and our product makes it easier to buy that product at auctions our software <unk> around 3rd party native websites to add additional functionality and a dashboard layout for fast data <unk> from multiple data points 
 well my tale starts 2 years ago with a guy that signed up for our software 
 we went above and beyond to train this guy late at <unk> a couple hours after normal business hours 
 our account managers and support staff spent hours with this guy trying to teach him it 's not <unk> science it 's actually pretty easy to use the software and best practices to get him drilled in quickly 
 one day he emails me complaining how he hates certain functionality on one of the client sites we wrap around - i explained in a very business professional email that those functions are native site functionality that we do not control those are elements native to the website and he should contact that company to express any changes he would like made 
 he then replies back and <unk> the entire executive staff at the other company screaming in all caps i have complained about these issues for years and no one listens to me 
 so he tried to <unk> me 
 because of other staff abuse and him just <unk> getting it i was able to get him cut loose and banned 
 the only user i have ever banned in my 20+ <unk> career 
 it was that bad 
 we put notes in our crm to never call the guy again and do n't let him sign back up 
 fast forward to yesterday 
 we just launched a new product at a recent trade show event and guess who signed up 
 new sales staff and a recent <unk> or our crm software <unk> into them not knowing and they signed him 
 yesterday as soon as we found out we let the new account manager know the fine details of the situation so he is prepared for the shitstorm this user may bring 
 last night the emails begin from the account manager 'i have a situation on my hands 
 within a couple hours the guy was blowing up my <unk> <unk> with complaints and abuse 
 1st email from the manager - cut him loose we knew this would happen and he is n't worth the time and effort 
 user banned again 
 seriously made my night 
 love it when a company has your back and wo n't put up with bullshit abuse this was a little while back now working one of my first jobs in it it was a laptop repair place that mainly did toshiba warranty repairs 
 now let me just give you some background info this place was fairly dodgy they would claim all sorts of parts from toshiba even if it was n't a warranty job 
 screens were a great one as at that time they could cost upwards of $ <unk> $ 2000 just for the screen replacement 
 they would also charge customers ridiculous labour hours as they claimed they had to test the laptops thoroughly before giving it back when in reality we never did any testing other than checking if the problem was fixed then moved on to the next one 
 this one model of toshiba forget which one exactly would always come in with the same issue the screen connectors would come loose and cause the screen to display incorrectly showing different colours lines across the screen etc 
 a few months into the job a customer comes in with this exact issue by then i 'd done enough of them to spot the problem right away 
 the customer stated in a nice way that he was in a rush as he needed to get to work and needed the laptop 
 as he was polite about it i thought hell ill fix it right here and now 
 i knew what the problem was 
 so i quickly pulled the screen apart cleaned the monitor cable connections plugged it all back in and put it back together 
 fired it up and sure enough screen was displaying correctly 
 only took me a few minutes 
 the customer stood there in awe as if to say how the hell did you just do that '' 
 he was happy to pay the bill and was on his way thanking me for fixing it so quickly 
 a couple of days later the manager approaches me for a chat he goes on to tell me that i should never fix anything on the spot as we could have kept it for a day or two and charged the customer a lot more for it 
 i defended myself by saying that customer probably left there and would have been so happy he would have told his friends about it and given us more business through word of mouth / <unk> 
 but he would n't have any of it that 's not how this company operated they would rather rip people off 
 he then gave me 2 options either i play their dodgy game or leave 
 i got fired friday that <unk> inevitable consequence of heading to bed the second you get home is that the morning tends to come quicker than you expected 
 i arrived <unk> eyed not truly knowing what fresh hell angie was about to <unk> that day 
 my fate was postponed as angie was busy providing a <unk> of every detail as <unk> <unk> her desk to angie 's preference 
 it became apparent that angie had taken issue to some typical <unk> <unk> and was ordering it be <unk> <unk> in desk drawers or <unk> of 
 a <unk> reminder of another of yesterday 's <unk> came in the shape of an email from hr tank demanding to know when her new faster '' computer would be delivered 
 not only was hrt 's computer perfectly fine it was only 10 months old and not due for replacement for two years 
 this i knew was an argument i would have to save for later 
 i logged a ticket and moved on 
 bhit arrived in just after me and made a <unk> at my desk 
 he must have felt it his duty to appear interested over my late night last night 
 his pale head seemed to <unk> against the dimly lit office lighting 
 i grabbed the opportunity like a child with a new toy and demanded that we resolve this build area problem immediately 
 with angie trapped in her reprimand of qbg i knew i was stealing her thunder 
 this is getting just stupid now 
 customers are complaining about us doing hardware replacements and <unk> at the desk side what 's more they 're taking longer as we 've had to use usb hard disks for builds since the ghost server went missing we have six machines now that nobody knows where they are the networking gear has also gone missing what annoys me is that all this was working perfectly fine while we had our build area 
 so the fact remains you need to sort this out now 
 we have a major rollout project coming up sort it out '' 
 my concern echoed with my vocal severity bhit was well and truly put in his place 
 i could feel angie <unk> as i had beaten her to the punch 
 bhit 's bald head nodded as he claimed he understood 
 with every nod a ceiling light just slightly came into view as he stood over my desk almost cowering behind the green partition 
 it was about damn time he took this on board 
 bhit walked away with the weight of the world on his shoulders 
 he knew i was right he knew he had to step in 
 i sat at my desk uncomfortably the newly recovered <unk> ghost server had found temporary shelter home under my desk where my legs should go the psu fan blew hot air almost providing some relief from the cold - a small yet powerful offering from the <unk> object almost thanking me for its rescue 
 the prize was <unk> exciting as for first time in many weeks my overnight whatsalive script proudly showed ghost server as now being <unk> to the network like a <unk> 's <unk> 
 it 's location 
 switch <unk> port 19 area its 
 i busied myself that morning by staying <unk> to my desk firing out responses to some of my tickets 
 in part i wanted to make sure bhit was doing his job but i also wanted to see how angie would react to having the rug pulled out from under her again 
 an hour rolled by and angie was still busy reprimanding the team 
 she had worked out - or been shown - how to properly use touchpaper and its accompanying stats screens 
 the evidence of an inter-team rat was all too clear as angie who could barely use outlook could never have worked out touchpaper to this degree 
 nevertheless this rat would have to be discovered at a later date 
 tea in hand i rolled up to bhit 's desk for progress 
 finally he had some news 
 i was to report to facilities so they could show me some rooms 
 i picked up my <unk> death <unk> to embark on my fantastic voyage 
 but the familiar loud rattle of angie 's keys disappearing into her small leather handbag accompanied her bony figure as it stood up to place a black and grey shawl around her <unk> neck 
 right let 's go '' she proclaimed as if to usurp leadership of my mission 
 bhit <unk> behind his computer screen rather than face <unk> 
 what could i say 
 i felt the next hour of efficient decision making suddenly hampered as angie set off to facilities as if dragging me by my ear like a scolded <unk> 
 after the facilities manager had led us to our third room visit it soon became clear what angie thought <unk> a suitable room 
 she wanted something near to the main office so she could check up on us regularly difficult to work in and not much space 
 ironically the meeting room would have fit angie 's <unk> exactly 
 i wanted something near the it cupboard for supplies - access was another battle i was soon to wage - plenty space and somewhere away from the freezing cold aircon vents 
 we finally came upon angie 's ideal 
 the only access was a flight of stairs - just short enough in number to appear inconsequential yet just ever so slightly add enough inconvenience to keep this bitter woman happy 
 add to the annoyance of not being able to get a trolley up them they were just narrow enough to ensure scraped knuckles in the event of anything <unk> 
 this would be enough for angie to know that this place would be a last resort - no longer a fort of <unk> when the outside world became too much 
 the room itself was just about big enough for a couple of desks and right above the door hummed the icy cold draft of the aircon vent 
 this is totally unsuitable 
 any one of the first few rooms would be fine '' 
 i <unk> 
 angie completely ignored me as her bitter face spat out this will do 
 the facilities manager looked perplexed at angie 's decision 
 rather than argue it he just agreed and muttered something about arranging access and desks 
 i knew this would happen 
 i relayed our <unk> to its as angie disappeared off for another starbucks run with her menopause group 
 their faces looked angry 
 calls of out of all the rooms you just saw angie picked some <unk> that 's basically gone unused for years '' 
 rather than offer an explanation i merely motioned in the direction of bhit still cowering behind his monitor 
 i could see none of my colleagues were going to speak up 
 it 'd have to be me again 
 fine 
 bhit ... '' i started 
 he almost winced behind his monitor - he knew what was coming 
 can you come and join us for a second '' 
 after <unk> yet again what had just transpired bhit seemed like he was mustering all the courage that he could 
 as i continued let loose on what a stupid decision angie had made together with her obvious attempts to prevent the team actually working he dug deep one last time 
 with a <unk> yet determined voice he said i thought i told you to get a new build room sorted out 
 well which one do you want '' 
 i looked back at my crew and just said well actually the it cupboard was perfect 
 it 's got a window it 's worked fine for years there 's plenty storage in fact it 's only called a cupboard because there 's racking and <unk> in there 
 i also have an email you sent to fat tony from 3rd line when he was on 2nd authorizing the use of the cupboard and having facilities convert part of it for <unk> ... '' sometimes the odd swift half after work with monkeys in other teams can pay <unk> leave it with me '' 
 said bhit as he made for the doorway 
 its smiled at me but deep down i <unk> a brick i 've really done it now 
 if i wind up getting bhit to <unk> the chains on our beloved cupboard i can only imagine what sort of games angie will play with that one 
 but i was pleased 
 for once i was up where she did n't know i was up 
 she was out with a bunch of <unk> women blissfully unaware sipping her <unk> starbucks coffee somehow providing life support for her <unk> <unk> ... i decided i did n't care about angie 's reaction anymore 
 i 'd won a major victory 
 now to just let the day play out 
 i wonder what monday morning will bring 
 **previous** pt1 : a new world order pt2 : safety first pt3 : the it induction from hell pt4 : undercurrents pt5 : how to make friends and ... pt6 : marking territories pt7 : one friday to rue them all pt8 : best laid plans pt9 : its one step for man pt10 : ... and one step back for its pt11 : bring home the solider i was on a remote session with a customer today and needed to reboot the machine i was connected to 
 i ask if it 's ok they say yes so i go to reboot it 
 as you may or may not know if you 're connected via remote desktop there is no shutdown '' button only disconnect '' to cut you off from the remote session 
 to get around this i plan to open a command window and manually type in a restart command 
 i hit windows key + r typed in <unk> and hit enter saw the command window appear typed in *shutdown -r <unk> 0 <unk> and then hit enter 
 this all happened in about 5 seconds as i 'm so used to doing it 
 then i looked up and saw **my** machine restarting 
 i 'd hit windows + r but it did n't send the command to the remote machine all the typing and the shutdown command had been entered on my computer instead 
 cue colleagues and the customer after i <unk> the session laughing at me 
 it 's not always the users that are dumb ... 
 edit : ok yes i could have done one of the following : * <unk> <unk> so i had time to run *shutdown <unk> * <unk> + <unk> + end * start menu - & gt windows security * <unk> + <unk> on the desktop * reboot using the task manager * <unk> everyone 
 i work as 1st level tech support for a large mobile phone company 
 there 's a lot of stupid things going on but this one was too dumb to not share with you 
 & gt me : how can i help you 
 & gt customer : i traveled abroad with my phone i did n't use it and now its broken 
 & gt me : can you specify what exactly is broken 
 do you get a signal 
 & gt customer : no i ca n't even turn it on 
 the battery died on my vacation i did n't bring the charging cable because i was n't going to use it 
 & gt me : did you plug it in when you got home 
 & gt customer : yes it 's plugged in right now it still does n't work 
 did you change my contract while i was abroad 
 she thought we barred her contract because she was abroad 
 & gt me : no besides that would n't break your phone 
 what happens when you try turning it on 
 & gt customer : should i try that 
 & gt me : yes please 
 & gt customer : oh it 's doing something 
 did you fix it 
 & gt me : you have to turn it on when it 's off otherwise it wo n't do anything 
 & gt customer : oh i see 
 well thank you 
 will this happen everytime i go abroad 
 & gt me : no it has nothing to do with that 
 this went on for a while at the end of the call she was still convinced that we shut her phone down because she went abroad 
 previous monday <unk> & gt **new ticket** - *a program is not working 
 recently had a computer upgrade please advice 
 * <unk> typical no information at all 
 i picked up the phone and called pursales 
 & gt me : hey it’s it here 
 what program isn’t working 
 & gt pursales : ahh yes 
 come take a look 
 i can’t get certain programs working at all 
 i sighed and resigned myself to a trip up to sales 
 as i walked out of my office into the it department redcheer smiled and walked over she held a box in one hand 
 & gt redcheer : chocolate 
 & gt me : <unk> you get these 
 i looked down at the nice box of <unk> presented to me 
 i took a coffee <unk> one 
 & gt redcheer : ummm hr 
 & gt me : are you asking me 
 & gt redcheer : no no hr got them i was a bit upset there on friday 
 i think these are meant to make me feel better 
 i shrugged and started walking to sales popping the chocolate into my mouth as i went 
 <unk> the delightful coffee <unk> 
 ***** as i arrived at pursales desk she looked up slightly startled 
 her eyes <unk> at me 
 & gt pursales : are you it 
 & gt me : yep 
 which program isn’t working 
 & gt pursales : are you eating chocolate 
 i swallowed the remaining chocolate and smiled 
 & gt me : coffee <unk> my favourite 
 & gt pursales : <unk> unprofessional 
 pursales turned her nose up at me as if i were a <unk> and she a princess 
 i decided to ignore it focus on the job 
 i took control of the mouse off her and opened up a few critical programs 
 & gt me : which program is causing the error 
 & gt pursales : i can’t get my purple monkey to work 
 & gt me : purple <unk> 
 pursales snatched the mouse back off me and quickly directed her browser to the bonzibuddy website 
 it was blocked 
 & gt pursales : on my home computer i got it from here but i can’t download it 
 when i tried moving it with usb drives it failed 
 & gt me : this is spyware 
 i honestly couldn’t believe someone wanted to install bonzibuddy 
 & gt pursales : i want my monkey 
 & gt me : no 
 i’m not installing bonzibuddy on a company computer 
 & gt pursales : install it 
 i need my monkey 
 he helps me do work 
 & gt me : no 
 pursales gave me a look of fury 
 she didn’t seem to understand the term <unk> & gt pursales : i’ll get my manager 
 i need this working 
 i sighed i didn’t really want to talk to the sales manager 
 i turned my nose up at pursales 
 & gt me : this particular program is <unk> unprofessional 
 next this tale <unk> back a few years when we were in the midst of replacing the <unk> of <unk> in the wild with a <unk> of dell laptops 
 luckily we had $ hard_worker contracting for us at the time - he powered through almost all of these while i was busy doing other things 
 we started on the sales reps as they were a logistically the most challenging and b not generally known for their <unk> treatment of laptops so some machines were running on borrowed time 
 to address the <unk> <unk> we bought 10 or so 32gb flash drives and bundled them with the new laptops along with a sheet of basic information about how to set the new machine up and the major differences between windows xp and 7. we also included a note asking them to call $ hard_worker so that he could log in remotely and finish their email setup install their home office printer and walk them through transferring their data 
 one <unk> friday afternoon my phone rang 
 i reluctantly put aside my <unk> chicken schnitzel burger 
 & gt **me : ** $ company it this is moufassa 
 & gt ** $ <unk> : ** oh hi moufassa it 's $ rsr here 
 & gt * $ rsr was only a couple of years off retirement at the time and a <unk> computer <unk> but a very pleasant guy to deal with 
 he also lives around <unk> from the nearest regional centre so we had his type in mind when we <unk> the flash drive plan 
 * & gt ** $ rsr : ** i received a new computer from you a few weeks ago and it 's working really well now 
 i just need your help getting $ <unk> working 
 & gt **me : ** sure i can <unk> ... hang on it 's working well <unk> 
 was it not working properly before 
 & gt ** $ rsr : ** well it did n't have any of my stuff on it and i could n't print so i transferred my stuff and installed the printer software 
 & gt **me : ** oh so you talked to $ hard_worker 
 & gt ** $ rsr : ** no i did n't call anyone 
 i did it all myself 
 & gt **me : ** y ... you did it yourself 
 transferred all your data from your old laptop to the new one 
 & gt <unk> : ** yep and yep 
 that 's what that usb drive you included is for is n't it 
 & gt **me : ** * gobsmacked * well yeah but <unk> here to help you do it 
 & gt ** $ rsr : ** i nearly threw it out the window a few times but i did n't want to bother you 
 let 's just say i know a lot more about how google works 
 i quickly sorted his crm issue out and then checked out his handiwork 
 all his photos outlook archives documents desktop files - *everything* was in its place 
 $ rsr retired last year but he will forever remain the user that could 
 tl dr : user interrupts consumption of a chicken schnitzel burger wins place in moufassa 's heart 
 edit : hey <unk> 
 sweet 
 edit teh second : lots of people have asked for details on the chicken <unk> burger ... i 've described it in the comments 
 enjoy but do n't blame me for the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 i 'm on the senior helpdesk team for a hospital system in my area 
 we have a secure messaging system that has both desktop and mobile phone interfaces that nurses will page doctors with 
 this system is entirely independent of our ad domain but uses our exchange email addresses to create user accounts 
 a call was forwarded to me for assistance with a user who could n't log in 
 <unk> <unk> inept nurse <unk> 's manager & gt me : information systems this is thepaintsaint '' 
 & gt nm : hello this is nm i need to get one of my nurses logged into the secure message system 
 we 've called a few times and placed several tickets yet she 's still unable to get logged in '' 
 & gt me : sure let me pull up the console ... who are we talking about '' 
 & gt nm : nurse she 's gone through the setup via email invite and she logged on once but she can no longer remember her username to log in '' 
 & gt me : ok let me bring her account up ... uh ... i have n't seen this before ... let me make sure it 's right '' 
 the username is a <unk> field when setting up the account 
 most people use the first part of their username - <unk> if my email address is thepaintsaint @ <unk> i 'd use thepaintsaint as my username 
 but this user was special 
 & gt me : yeah this is odd but i guess it works 
 her username is 'domain.org '' 
 & gt nm : you mean like our website '' 
 & gt me : yeah nurse 's username is our website address ... never seen someone do that but since the system is entirely different than the rest of our network it could be <unk> or 'domain.org or anything really that they want to put in there 
 have her try that and give us a call if you need further help '' 
 tl dr : user uses our domain name as her username it <unk> teacher at my school sent email to the it department asking where her students could get copies of ms powerpoint from 
 she said her students would need it during the year when doing project presentations for her class 
 we emailed back telling her that powerpoint was available in office <unk> which all of the students can get for free 
 it is a part of our site <unk> program 
 they just needed to log into their student accounts to get the details 
 at the end of the day we get another email from the instructor asking which building office <unk> was in 
 she could n't find it when she walked around looking for it 
 **tldr : ** manager wo n't let us make fake signs leading to the fire escape 
 so i came into work today and i had an email marked <unk> 
 * in outlook 
 it seems that the end of fiscal year '' inventory is due at the end of this week and they need some information 
 we use ibm tivoli <unk> manager purchased from a company called bigfix for our inventory stuff and patching etc so i ask what information they need 
 & gt we just need all the boxes that run <unk> and their versions ... well that information is n't just sitting in a text file on the servers 
 a batch file on each box will output the information for us and we can just pipe it into a text file but that would require us to touch each box or push out a fixlet to do it we obviously decided to do the latter 
 after that text file is generated we can <unk> the information from the text file and put it in web reports another ibm purchase from bigfix 
 it should be easy 
 i never should have said that 
 i tell them that this wo n't be a problem 
 it will take me an hour or two to set up the fixlet and the analysis for web reports but it will probably take a day for tivoli to gather all the relevant boxes another day to push the action to them we have <unk> <unk> and then at least 4 hours for the analysis to <unk> the text files and pull the version information 
 well this is unacceptable 
 their part of the report is due by end of day and they only need some quick and simple '' information 
 i inform them that there really is n't a way to push it any faster even if i <unk> it and i do not have access to these boxes so i ca n't just run the batch files manually 
 well at this point they decide to have a chat with my boss and it <unk> a meeting 
 we 're all sitting around the table and they tell my boss : & gt craysh has been <unk> unhelpful in helping us get some easily accessed information 
 he gave us an eta of 2 1/2 days before he could even get to it and this is important 
 he asked me what was going on and being familiar with tivoli himself as well as our environment he understood exactly what would take so long 
 he turned to the inventory group and said : & gt this is how long it will take to get this information <unk> out 
 he 's not stringing you along it 's just how our infrastructure will work 
 once it 's in place it will take at most 4 hours between updating the <unk> information and it will be available to you any time you need it 
 they respond : & gt that is totally unacceptable 
 we need this information in be the end of the day 
 my boss responded : & gt your lack of planning does not <unk> an emergency on our part 
 i got <unk> 
 okay i 'm going to start by saying this did not happen recently it was probably around october 2014 time 
 basically i worked on a it helpdesk for an outsourcing company who was contracted at the time to a large <unk> company in the uk 
 i was working nights as cover for a colleague who was off sick 
 this is the story of my worst user ever at 4am 
 lets call him s and me <unk> & gt l : how can i help you sir 
 & gt s : i logged a call with you guys earlier as my pc will not turn on at all 
 i went through the diagnostics with a colleague of yours who advised me i will need an replacement machine 
 & gt l : okay yeah i can see on our systems an engineer is scheduled for later today between <unk> to replace your pc 
 & gt s : thats no good i am unable to get any files off my pc at the moment so i ca n't continue to work 
 i want an engineer out right now 
 & gt l : sir the on-call field services engineer is only available for high priority incidents that are affecting multiple users 
 unfortunately this does not justify a <unk> 
 & gt s : this pc should of been replaced years ago it is very old and you are only replacing it now that it has broken 
 this is <unk> & gt l : apologies sir but all pc 's on the estate are issued at the same time and only replaced when there is a irreparable issue with one of them 
 & gt s : i do n't care 
 if this i do not have an engineer here in 30 minutes i will be going to my manager and handing in my notice as i can not work under these conditions 
 & gt l : unfortunately i can do nothing to get the engineer to you as it would be against all of our policies for an issue of this sort 
 & gt s : whatever half an hour or i will be leaving 
 <unk> hangs <unk> a few days later i was doing some account admin work during quiet spells on the phones and a request comes through for me to delete s 's account 
 turns out he did actually hand over in his notice over a broken pc 
 the even funnier thing was i looked into his incident history and this was the first issue we had on record for him 
 he had never before had a pc issue at work since we upgraded the entire estate 4 years prior 
 tl dr : guy has a broken pc demands <unk> at 4am i <unk> he <unk> his <unk> had been using her pc with xp for an awful long time and realised she needed to upgrade after microsoft started putting popups on her pc 
 we order her a nice new overkill dell laptop so it will last the next 10 years she receives it and rings me up after an hour of not being able to open her laptop lid 
 & gt grandma : hi <unk> are you busy 
 & gt me : nope what 's up 
 & gt grandma : i just got my new laptop and neither me or <unk> can work out how to open it up we do n't want to break it so we thought we better ring you 
 & gt me : you 're having trouble opening the box 
 & gt grandma : no we got it out of the box but we ca n't get to the keyboard 
 there are two clips at the front but they do n't do anything 
 & gt me : one moment i 'll look up a picture online ... at this point i find the laptop and see there is no mechanism to open the lid 
 & gt me : you literally just pull the lid up there are no clips 
 & gt grandma : there are two clips here are you sure you 're looking at the right picture 
 i look at the images again and suddenly realise what she 's looking at 
 & gt me : grandma you 're looking at the back of the laptop 
 you need to turn it around 
 those clips are the <unk> for the screen 
 at this point there is a lot of laughter from both sides 
 & gt grandma : the dell logo was round the wrong way though why is the dell logo upside down from the front 
 & gt me : grandma that 's because when you open the lid its the correct orientation from the back side 
 more laughter and then the call ends this was the first time she had owned a laptop in <unk> calls in and leaves a message on our ticket system : & gt i need an urgent call back '' 
 no details just panic 
 this is a team leader / supervisor at our largest client a call centre so i figure the router 's exploded or something 
 i pick up the phone 
 & gt him : yeah i 'm looking to move a phone from this end of the desk to the other 
 the cable does n't reach that far '' 
 & gt me : ... sorry our engineers are all booked today 
 we 'll be onsite tomorrow but not before then 
 have you tried swapping the cable for a longer one '' 
 & gt him : oh 
 oh yeah that would work '' 
 what 
 leaves me wondering if he 's ever dialled <unk> because he <unk> his <unk> 
 other urgent support requests this supervisor has called us about : - user 's 2nd monitor turned off and wo n't turn back on 
 we 've tried everything 
 solution : plug the power cable back in 
 - he ca n't access the shared folder on the server 
 solution : connect his laptop to the network 
 - user 's computer crashes constantly 
 solution : user was lying in hopes of getting issued a new pc 
 i do n't work in it but i 'm the only tech savvy person in the department 
 i came out of a long appointment and one of the admin staff came running up to me saying that her monitor has gone weird 
 it turned 90 degrees and she tried to turn the monitor to compensate but still had to <unk> her neck at 45 degrees for about an hour waiting for me to come out 
 i pressed the shortcut to get the screen to <unk> back to normal 
 she looks gobsmacked 
 but at least i saved her neck 
 knowing her she could have been like that all day we 've all been there before 
 there 's a conference room full of field reps sales reps and the like in town for training 
 it 's day two of the training 
 and after yesterday 's treat of plugging speakers into a laptop i thought all the high level work had been done 
 boy was i wrong 
 today we had a crisis not seen in the it world since <unk> or the <unk> virus 
 my manager tasked me with resolving a problem that brought the conference room to its knees 
 it seems the projector was n't displaying any video 
 like at all 
 like it was as if there were no projector at all 
 the regional manager had the vga plug connected to his laptop just as i had directed him to do from yesterday 
 he even had the laptop turned on 
 but lo no video of any kind was being displayed 
 drawing on my 20+ years of system administration and tier ii level deskside technician experience 
 i did something crazy 
 most technicians would cringe at the mere suggestion of this practice 
 i picked up the remote control for the projector sitting next to the laptop 
 was it that simple 
 i pressed the button that says on 
 i held my breath 
 at first the image was faint 
 like a <unk> <unk> <unk> painting 
 then in <unk> <unk> the same display from the laptop appeared on the screen 
 i nearly passed out from the excitement 
 few <unk> techs can realize the genuine high you get when fixing a problem of that magnitude that <unk> left a job a few years ago 
 today they called me back to solve a problem with their website that my replacement could n't handle 
 i decided to skim through their tickets with their web host so i could see what had already been tried 
 in the process i found this gem written by my replacement : & gt '' we are installing new software and we need access to the main router i think it’s a asus router – do you know where i can find it - i have the password '' 
 let 's forget for a moment that you do n't need physical access to your router to install software 
 he is somehow under the impression that the support rep at his web host - who lives in another city and has never even been to his building - can tell him physically where in the office his router <unk> my kids young <unk> are bitching because they want netflix and we do n't have it 
 talking it through we decide to drop a premium cable package and order netflix 
 everyone is happy with this 
 i send the family a text after doing this the next day ... & amp gt *we now have a netflix account 
 username password 
 if anyone watches this over your phone i will hang you by your toes in the backyard 
 use wifi ... love you 
 * oldest kid goes on a weekend trip the next day with his friend and their family for the weekend 
 monday morning i get a text from at & amp amp t : & amp gt * '' you have reached 75 % of your data for the month ... '' * wtf 
 check at & amp amp t usage and netflix usage ... pissed i go talk to him after work that day : & amp gt me : dude 
 you watched netflix over the phone at friends lake house this weekend 
 what 'd i say about that 
 & amp gt child : no i did n't 
 i used wifi 
 & amp gt me : i thought you said friend did n't have wifi at the lake house 
 & amp gt child : he does n't 
 i created a hotspot with my phone and we watched on his laptop 
 & amp gt me : <unk> <unk> ... waiting on a <unk> kidding 
 * & amp gt child : what 
 we used wifi 
 *facepalm* edit : formatting edit : holy crap 
 front page for this 
 i shall celebrate this event 
 first time posting <unk> 
 on mobile so forgive formatting 
 i just had a user call wondering why he could n't back up his outlook file to his external hard drive 
 the file was <unk> and he had <unk> free 
 i 'm still fairly new to it so i am stumped 
 i ask him to read the error to me exactly 
 the file is too large for destination file system '' 
 file system 
 wait a minute ... i am reminded of a joke from <unk> ... yo <unk> is so fat she ca n't save files larger than <unk> '' 
 i then direct the user on how to check which file system his drive is using 
 sure enough ... it 's <unk> and not ntfs 
 so he ca n't do anything but reduce the file size or save it somewhere else and i let him know 
 : thanks reddit 
 : <unk> work it for a school 
 last night at about 10 as i 'm <unk> my teeth i get a somewhat frustrated email from a teacher who i helped by performing ipconfig <unk> on her laptop earlier that day 
 apparently that had *not* solved her problem as allegedly her internet stopped working almost the moment i left and her entire teaching day was a disaster as a result 
 how that is supposed to reflect badly on *me* who did n't know about it instead of *her* who could n't be bothered to dial my extension when i was there for a couple more hours that day i 'm not sure 
 i ignore go to bed and get this the next morning from one of the <unk> administrators : & gt i have heard nothing about what the plans are to deal with this 
 no you have n't heard plans because we only became aware there was a problem literally as we were going to sleep 
 i 'm very very part-time and the degree to which i 'm on-call is limited to you know reasonable daylight hours and stuff that actually <unk> to be immediately addressed 
 this does n't qualify 
 i also get this email from another : & gt she has been without internet for a week it is wednesday 
 last week was the middle of spring break 
 we have only been in school for 2 days so far and i learned that there was still a problem a mere 10 hours ago 
 tl dr : <unk> is n't <unk> out of bed in the middle of night and driving to <unk> 's house to fix the problem they sat on the entire workday without telling me and one which has existed for longer than the current academic term 
 <unk> the it guy 
 previous heads of department meetings are a waste of time normally 
 i sat down in my chair and stared at the new projector in the middle of the boardroom table 
 it was a fine looking beast 
 so clean 
 & gt vp : <unk> meeting will be a little different as the head builder will be <unk> the work on our buildings thats about to start 
 & gt headhr : shouldn’t this have been done ages ago 
 the new projector pointed at the screen eager to work 
 & gt vp : let’s not get into the <unk> 
 & gt headhr : and why are we starting a building project in the middle of winter 
 both valid points were completely missed by me 
 i was too busy admiring the sleek lines and fine <unk> white exterior of the projector 
 & gt vp : well yes but… the vp never got to finish his defense as the builder had entered the room 
 he walked up to the projector and plugged in his computer 
 & gt gbuild : so as you might be aware we’re nearing the start of our building <unk> 
 the head builder looked up at the projector screen expectantly 
 the projector was displaying a plain black screen 
 & gt gbuild : f* % $ ing thing 
 <unk> was looking down at the new projector with great fury its <unk> white cover glared <unk> back at him 
 & gt me : maybe i should take a look… 
 headbuilders fist rose into the air 
 & gt me : <unk> headbuilders fist slammed down into the projector slightly <unk> its surface 
 my eyes glazed over 
 & gt me : what the <unk> 
 * you don’t hit equipment 
 ever 
 the head builder looked over at my face slowly filling with anger 
 & gt gbuild : calm down these things are built to last 
 i once demolished a room with one inside and when we went through the <unk> with a digger we found it 
 it still worked 
 & gt me : okay a no you did not 
 and b don’t hit our equipment regardless of its build quality 
 & gt gbuild : **are you calling me a liar 
 ** <unk> face had gone completely red he was screaming 
 he’d completely lost it 
 i opened my mouth to retort but saw <unk> fist <unk> and thought better of it 
 & gt vp : calm <unk> please 
 the head builder blinked a few times as if remembering where he was 
 & gt gbuild : sorry everyone 
 … 
 i’m just a little stressed 
 i wondered why a builder who hadn’t started work would be stressed they hadn’t screwed anything up yet 
 the vp passed round paper copies of the new plans for the buildings 
 i took a look at the it department areas 
 oh for <unk> $ sake 
 & gt me : hey vp who made these plans 
 & gt vp : gbuild is a builder and <unk> he drew them up 
 why 
 & gt me : fire him 
 he’s an idiot 
 & gt vp : what 
 <unk> 
 next another short but sweet one 
 before myself <unk> manager became a one full time man department there were 3 of us 
 one of these <unk> a mate i add had his mom working at the company with us 
 she was the ceo 's pa. shes a great lady but one day she was being <unk> and she had admin access one of the few users on the system we trust to listen and no screw up 
 so this one day she calls us over to the office for a problem she admits shes caused 
 & gt us : so whats all the fuss about 
 & gt lady : i think i 've broke the internet 
 & gt us : ok so what make you think you did that 
 & gt lady : i was messing with the desktop and before i knew it i had deleted the ie icon 
 before i could say anything her son comes out with : & gt son : yea you broke the internet nobody is able to get on the internet now thanks mom ... we do n't tend to do this one because she 's rarely is a pain for us and because shes one of our work <unk> '' she maybe not in it but all the support staff cover each other 
 her face went white she was mortified 
 i gave it 5 seconds and told her she had n't and promptly restored the ie icon to her desktop all the while we were giggling 
 she took it well but safe to say her son did n't get sunday <unk> that weekend 
 <unk> mom relies on me for tech support at a moment 's notice 
 same story for the rest of you i imagine 
 she calls me to fix even the simplest of things without doing much if any troubleshooting first 
 today 's email though was different : & gt really didn’t want to bug you on your weekend but i needed to figure out why i was getting the “check signal cable” message 
 i realized i could ask google “how to fix check cable signal cable” and learned it meant the monitor wasn’t getting the signal 
 then i remembered i had disconnected that cable and not plugged it back in when i <unk> how the wires were running across my desk 
 so glad i didn’t call you 
 & gt pretty good right 
 & gt love & gt mom *wipes away a <unk> pretty good mom pretty <unk> : my mom has an ok laptop 
 not amazing but not a piece of crap 
 my sister is a programmer '' on her <unk> team she does nothing that i volunteer for 
 my sister is tech illiterate 
 recently my mom turned on her laptop 
 she had n't used it in a while 
 after taking 10 minutes to get to the desktop she <unk> 
 $ mom : & gt what the hell happened to my laptop 
 me and my dad my dad is a <unk> person go over <unk> and we see an <unk> 
 this poor laptop has 2 toolbars lots of sketchy desktop shortcuts and expired <unk> antivirus 
 and pop-ups 
 $ mom : & gt i did n't do anything 
 i have n't used this thing since october 
 sure enough me and my dad look through the downloads folder and s*** hit the fan on <unk> 
 after looking closer we see that the first thing installed on <unk> was a sketchy art program that i 've never heard of 
 the kind my sister tries to get me to download on my nice desktop 
 $ me : & gt $ sister what the hell did you do on <unk> 
 $ sister : & gt i think i got the $ <unk> that day 
 $ me : & gt did you hear of that program before you downloaded it 
 $ sister : & gt no but it was free and recommended by millions of people 
 *facepalm* $ sister : & gt i swear i did n't download anything else 
 i do n't even know the rest of the stuff on there 
 my dad is still trying to get the crap off of there 
 tl dr : not everything you see on the internet is true 
 <unk> <unk> 
 also do n't let your little sister have the admin password 
 previous a new day a new cup of coffee 
 i smiled as i looked at the three people assembled in the meeting room for interview round two 
 at least this next candidate will get a fair trial 
 a table had been set up along which the head of hr myself the vp and bigp all sat 
 the interview was to start at 9am 
 i looked at my watch 
 <unk> failed already 
 the door gave a rattle then opened to a middle aged gentleman dressed in a reasonably nice suit 
 no tie 
 & gt notie : hello is this the… interview room 
 & gt vp : yes 
 i take it you’re notie 
 come in sit down 
 notie walked into the room he placed a copy of his resume/cv in front of each of us 
 very professional 
 i looked down at the resume it was a pretty impressive amount of skills 
 however under listed employment only one company was named 
 & gt vp : what did you do between school and your first job 
 there is a 10 year gap 
 notie looked down at his shoes he looked a little … defeated 
 & gt notie : err you haven’t done a background check yet 
 & gt vp : no <unk> <unk> 
 & gt notie : well for about seven of those years i was in prison 
 before that i was in a gang not really employed 
 i stopped looking at the paper he’d given me impressive as it was 
 prison 
 & gt headhr : what were you in prison for 
 if you don’t mind us asking 
 & gt notie : handling a restricted substance various <unk> offenses 
 i only got seven years because i rolled on my old gang members 
 they also dropped the chargers of assault with a <unk> weapon and armed <unk> 
 & gt vp : i see… an awkward silence settled on the conference room 
 i looked at his papers again 
 time for some tech questions 
 & gt me : so what languages do you know 
 & gt notie : french <unk> 
 & gt me : er… 
 i meant notie was laughing from his chair 
 & gt notie : just joking i know <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> plus a few things in the lower level like assembly 
 & gt me : oh nice so it says here you’ve been at the same company for 15 years 
 what types of jobs did you do there 
 & gt notie : what didn’t i do 
 ummm it was mostly helping out users 
 closing tickets 
 occasionally restoring backups rolling out new pc’s that kinda thing 
 & gt me : oh excellent it sounds exactly like what we do here so can i ask why leave your previous employment now 
 notie looked at me from his chair his eyes seemed hollow 
 & gt notie : my previous employer was my <unk> father 
 & gt headhr : <unk> you’re getting divorced 
 a little <unk> i thought 
 notie looked troubled 
 & gt notie : she passed away two months ago 
 unfortunately my father in law can not stand the sight of me 
 a single tear ran down noties face 
 i looked down the table head of hr looked mortified 
 vp’s face remained passive bigp was busy eyeing notie up and down 
 looking back at notie i realized i should probably get him a tissue however… we were in the middle of an interview 
 & gt bigp : any questions for us 
 before we wrap this up 
 & gt notie : no no 
 can i just thank you all for giving me the opportunity to interview with you i understand most companies avoid it because of my past 
 however that was over 15 years ago now and i will work hard for any company that <unk> to take me on 
 getting up from his chair notie wiped the tear from his eye and left 
 as soon as the door was closed bigp finally spoke 
 & gt bigp : well i know redcheer personally 
 so i’m going to <unk> from this vote 
 it’s up to you three to pick who gets the job 
 come tell me when you’ve decided 
 bigp walked out the door 
 & gt vp : well we’re hiring redcheer 
 head of hr looked horrified 
 & gt headhr : what 
 <unk> no 
 notie is way more qualified and he’s asking for very low pay on that position with so much experience 
 & gt vp : we’re not hiring a convicted armed <unk> 
 it’s not happening 
 headhr being a people person had obviously decided to <unk> notie 
 i didn’t know if that was a good or a bad thing 
 & gt headhr : he’s the candidate you put forward 
 how can you not want to hire him now 
 & gt vp : you told me to get someone at 6pm yesterday 
 i don’t just have people just sitting around wanting jobs 
 i rang up an agency and asked for an urgent <unk> for an it position 
 i asked if anyone would be keen enough to come in for a rush interview today 
 they told me they had the perfect person 
 little did i know it was a <unk> 
 & gt headhr : he’s <unk> 
 and he looks ready to work 
 the engagement between the vp and head of hr had caught me off guard 
 i still didn’t know what to think 
 & gt vp : look this is getting us nowhere 
 airz just pick one and lets go tell bigp 
 as we walked towards the <unk> i looked down at my hand it still held notie’s resume/cv 
 <unk> 
 pretty <unk> 
 next if you 're not familiar with it the cryptolocker virus <unk> your files and shreds them if you do n't pay them $ 300 or so 
 this accounting firm got it got the threatening letter wiped their server because they knew they had a good backup via carbonite 
 the tech decided to use a <unk> managed key instead of letting carbonite manage it presumably for extra security 
 he ca n't remember the password 
 the number of ways he fucked up is truly astounding 
 the owner has been blowing up my phone desperately hoping there 's some way to crack the <unk> encryption 
 all i can suggest is that she tell the nsa that <unk> <unk> sent her these files and ask what should she do with them 
 edit : omg 
 ok so i got some more information 
 1. right when it happened the owner asked the tech if it would be a good idea to clone the drive then pay the money and that way the person who would supposedly log in and decrypt the files not sure if that 's how it works but that 's what she said would n't have access to the server 
 he the tech said it was n't worth it 
 2. right after it happened they started to restore files from the carbonite backup one by one 
 it was taking so long that the tech said it was inefficient 
 that 's why he wiped the server to get the full backup 
 3. he has apparently spent the last 8 hour or so trying every password he could remember with no luck 
 4. i 'm going to try to throw <unk> at it and see what happens 
 i have a couple of <unk> so hey maybe we 'll get lucky 
 i do n't actually know how to do it yet but i 'm researching like a <unk> 
 i do n't need to crack the key i just need to get his password from it 
 this might be a total <unk> but jesus i feel like i need to do something 
 5. this company does my company 's payroll 
 i feel like i should throw that out there just because it makes the situation so much funnier 
 or not 
 6. i wish i could tell you the name of the company 
 i really do 
 the irony is so thick i could cut it with a <unk> 
 anyway i 'm off for the night 
 i can only take so much of this in one day so i 'm going to head out and drink myself into a <unk> with a good buddy 
 oh and last but not least i posted here that i liked getting <unk> of random things from random people and holy <unk> my phone exploded 
 i got snaps from all over the world with the <unk> <unk> most bizarre shit and it 's great 
 one guy had a chicken hat on and sent a <unk> of himself nodding to the chicken dance 
 i even got an epic set of <unk> and a few from women too 
 so with that in mind if you 're bored add <unk> and snap me stupid shit 
 i 'm a snapping <unk> nothing of real interest but i like taking pics and sending them out to the world 
 <unk> 
 shit 
 i forgot one thing 
 i said to the owner well it sucks but at least you can go to your email and get the files 
 i 'm sure your outlook pst was n't <unk> '' 
 i do n't send anything through email because it 's not secure '' 
 i had to mute the phone 
 ok last edit from my computer i may update as i get more lit as the night <unk> 
 i 'll update as this <unk> but the funny thing is i 've only been back doing the store stuff for 1 month 
 three times in one month i 've seen something that in 20+ years of it i 've never experienced 
 so while i have great sympathy for this owner and the firm omg there is n't enough <unk> for the popcorn 
 edit : someone <unk> in last night shit in my mouth and put little socks over all my teeth 
 <unk> edit : i 'm really enjoying the snaps 
 what 's really amazing is how good looking the people are who are snapping me 
 maybe it 's a <unk> pool but the stereotype of the <unk> <unk> is not being supported here 
 i work for a small 3rd party it company who install and manage <unk> for small to <unk> businesses 
 today the customer let 's call him bob tells me he thinks the server shut down last night with no warning and that he is going to change the ups he bought the ups to install himself to save money me : ok bob let me log onto the server and check the log bob : ok i 'll change the ups in a few minutes then few minutes <unk> and i get disconnected from logmein while checking the logs i give bob a call me : bob can you go to the server and check if its still on bob : oh i just changed the ups there now its turning back on me : ... did you shut it down before you do that 
 bob : .. no did i have too 
 me : yes ... bob : hangs up now the e-mail mailbox wont mount in exchange so now i have to try and repair it while the whole company can not send or receive emails ... thanks bob tl : dr user plugs out plug of live server without shutting down to change ups himself to save money and <unk> the mail database costing him a lot more time and money 
 thanks bob edit : got the mailbox repaired about 4 hours after the <unk> it cost bob a lot more than a a call out fee now : d this tale reminded me of one of my own 
 i worked frontline for a mass retailer with thousands of stores all around the country 
 every week we had critical applications that crashed and hundred of people calling us to check if it was down when it 'd be back up and so on ... so of course we set up automated recordings answering all these questions but there were *always* a lot of idiots who kept waiting because they were to stupid to listen 
 so one time i pick up the phone and there is n't anybody on the line but i can hear people talking in the background 
 so after raising my voice a bit and trying to get their attention for a minute a woman picks up the receiver 
 i tell her that she should n't do that because when that happens we usually end up dropping the call after 30 seconds 
 then she starts getting all annoyed yeah but i was on hold and i was busy working on something else it 's your fault for taking so much time answering '' which i know is bullshit she was talking about clothes with her coworker while i was trying to get her attention 
 of course she 's calling about the outage so i tell i tell her all the answers to your questions were in the automated recording that was <unk> during the 15 minutes you spent on hold '' 
 yeah i do n't listen to these when i do n't immediately have a technician i just put the phone on speaker and do something else '' 
 i was pretty pissed at that point so i tell her in a really nice voice ok no problem i 'll just put you back on the queue so you can listen to the messages again '' 
 then i dropped her on the queue before she had the time to answer 
 if you 're following the story and you 're not up to the new job hit the previous button 
 if you 've never read one of my tales before hopefully this small arc will hold up on its own 
 ***** previous first day of my new job 
 time to make a good impression 
 i walked in the door of the design company 
 a secretary greeted me 
 & gt me : hello im airz 
 i’ll be your tech for the week 
 i make my smile wide nothing like a great first impression 
 & gt sec : hey airz thank goodness you’re here 
 my smile <unk> a little nothing ever good happens when people are thankful for a tech being around 
 & gt sec : follow me i’ll take you around to the new pc’s that aren’t working 
 i followed the secretary into the design company 
 everything looked fairly tidy 
 we stopped in front of five brand new machines 
 & gt sec : our tech received these last week he’s installed all the programs and everything onto them already 
 however they keep crashing 
 & gt me : crashing 
 the secretary turned one on 
 it booted up fine 
 first impressions it was a fast good machine 
 & gt sec : wait for it… 
 wait for it… after about ten minutes waiting for this brand new pc to crash nothing had happened 
 & gt sec : oh 
 they’re working now 
 & gt me : maybe we should open a few things see if its a specific program 
 i opened a bunch of programs mostly at the same time 
 design programs are huge loads which i’d forgotten 
 i was stuck watching the computer struggle to open four programs that should never be open at the same time 
 <unk> the computer had just turned off mid load 
 & gt sec : see 
 they’re broken 
 we only got them last week too 
 & gt me : mmmm if they’re all like this its probably a manufactures <unk> & gt sec : can you do a return for us 
 my smile was painted to my face 
 good impressions remember 
 & gt me : sure sure 
 i’ll just ring your tech to double check some things 
 & gt sec : oh sure he left you this 
 the secretary handed me a list of contact numbers along with a small set of instructions on day to day work 
 i rang the tech’s number 
 & gt me : hey tech 
 it’s airz here 
 i’m covering your post for the week 
 & gt tech : oh airz hey good of you to call me 
 i looked at the five new computers set in front of me 
 they looked good brand new and not cheap 
 odd they’re all failing 
 & gt me : so these new computers you’ve gotten 
 & gt tech : top of the line they are 
 & gt me : yeah really nice pc’s 
 unfortunately they seem to be turning off under load 
 tech sounded a little downhearted about that 
 i think he’s very proud of his department 
 & gt tech : weird 
 all five 
 & gt me : yeah every one of them 
 should we send them back to the manufacturer 
 & gt tech : package them up and ship ‘em out 
 & gt me : aye aye 
 i hung up the phone a return was my first job at the company 
 nice 
 as i picked up the first pc i heard a small rattle 
 weird top of the line pc’s usually have cable management 
 i cracked open the case 
 what i saw almost <unk> me to the core even my good first impressions smile was gone 
 every power cord to a fan had been cut 
 not unplugged cut 
 i grabbed the phone and called up tech again 
 & gt me : hey tech 
 its airz again 
 do you know anything about cut fan cables inside the new computers 
 & gt tech : oh 
 i do 
 i always replace the fans with <unk> 
 & gt me : why 
 & gt tech : design companies are a place for creative people 
 fans are loud they break the creative process 
 i thought about asking how he cooled the water sump without fans but thought better of it 
 & gt me : so <unk> did these fans get cut 
 & gt tech : oh i was about to replace those fans with <unk> but i didn’t have all the parts 
 & gt me : so the cords got <unk> 
 & gt tech : they’re easier to take out cut 
 i looked at the pc internals 
 they didn’t seem too cooked 
 & gt me : so what do you want me to do with these pc’s 
 & gt tech : the parts should be there by now 
 maybe just install the water cooling 
 i hung up the phone 
 that was my first conversation with the most <unk> tech ever and now i was working in his place for a week 
 magical 
 next i spent a little under a year working in a retail electronics store which specialized in computer hardware 
 since my specialty was the networking equipment i often complemented my sales with tech support helping customers figure out what they needed how they could set up a network etc 
 most of the people i worked with were average users or office types with a minimal or basic understanding but there 's one that i just ca n't forget 
 the customer came in looking for a <unk> solution for his new business and wanted eight machines on a wired network as well as a wireless router that would cover something like <unk> square feet 
 smelling a steak dinner commission i spent close to 90 minutes giving him personalized attention walking him through how ports and addresses worked what kind of cabling solution was the most cost-effective the pros and cons of various routers etc 
 finally with about $ 2000 of hardware software accessories cat6 <unk> and warranty forms <unk> in his shopping cart this happens 
 **customer** : alright great 
 you 've been such a huge help 
 i think the only question i have n't asked yet is how i connect the internal network to the internet 
 **me** : could n't be simpler 
 just run this cable here from that port to the modem or gateway provided by your isp and you 'll be able to manage all the settings in the software i showed you 
 **customer** : isp 
 *the feeling of impending doom suddenly <unk> up inside me 
 * **customer** : i thought the whole reason i was buying all this was so i would n't have to deal with those <unk> companies 
 you told me this would be able to get me online 
 *the shadow of doom fell over the land 
 * **me** : <unk> ... once you have a <unk> from your isp 
 you would n't expect to get power in your home if you did n't pay the electric company no matter how fancy your light fixtures are right 
 same concept applies here 
 **customer** : what do you have that can get me around that 
 you 've been so helpful already just work with me here 
 **me** : sir i 'm sorry but there 's no way to work around <unk> to an isp if you want internet service 
 who 's your internet provider at home 
 **customer** : oh i just use the wifi 
 **me** : right but who do you pay for that service 
 **customer** : i do n't pay it 's the free one in my apartment building <unk> 
 it 's slow but i figured i could get better speed with all this expensive stuff you just sold me 
 now you 're telling me i should pay on top of all this 
 *i could hear it whispering in my ear doom doom doom 
 * **me** : it 's not that you should that 's just how the internet works 
 **customer** : what about my home wifi 
 why ca n't i get something similar at my office 
 **me not wanting to tell the customer he 's been stealing service from a similarly tech-illiterate <unk> : i do n't know the details of your home setup sir 
 but the setup we worked out here will cover your needs and make sure that you can keep things running smoothly and quickly even with a basic <unk> isp package 
 **customer** : so you 're saying you do n't have anything here to *actually* connect my business to the internet 
 well fuck you very much for wasting my time 
 i 'll just find someone who knows what they 're talking about 
 he walked off leaving me to put away everything in his cart 
 <unk> dr save money on data by upgrading to a faster router 
 *** i built a $ 100 pc for a family and my usually angry boss <unk> gifts them the accessories 
 so yesterday i had another client at the store carrying what seemed at first sight like a 20 years old computer the man seems to be in his 30s come in and with $ elboss and my co-worker being away i attend him for context i 'm in mexico and we use <unk> mxn i 'll just convert the currency for the tale 
 & gt $ me : welcome to taco-mputerstore my name is <unk> how may i help you 
 & gt $ father : hello young man i 'm going to need you to give me a budget for a basic computer for my son it 's his 9th birthday and i want to gift him a computer 
 & gt $ me : of course what is your maximum budget 
 & gt $ father : we only have about $ 100 or $ <unk> mxn my currency & gt $ me : only $ 100 
 well sir that is going to be tough there is n't much we can do with that 
 & gt $ father : in that case you think you can upgrade me this one 
 he places the case on the desk and $ elboss approach us 
 & gt $ elboss : hello sir what can we do for you 
 & gt $ me : boss the sir would like us to upgrade his desktop pc but he 's on a tight budget did n't we had some spares from the other day 
 & gt $ elboss : <unk> sir we have some parts on the back let me get you a budget 
 my boss brings some paper and pen and starts writing on it 100gb hdd intel <unk> cpu plus the motherboard windows 7 2gb of ram and a power supply the father looked at it next to the numbers close to $ 75 
 & gt $ me : we can also sell you the keyboard mouse and monitor 
 & gt $ father : and how would that cost 
 & gt $ me : give me a second 
 i head to the store computer and search for the cheapest monitor we still had a 1024x768 acer monitor in stock somewhere only $ 25 & gt $ me : well sir we reached your exact budget for this build 
 & gt $ father : what 's left 
 & gt $ me : well the keyboard loudspeaker and mouse will be about $ 25 more 
 we did n't had many in stock the father seemed to accept the offer but he was clearly worried about the remain of the payment 
 & gt $ father : i 'll try to get the remaining $ 25 & gt $ elboss : no no señor none of <unk> 
 we both looked at him 
 & gt $ elboss : this pc is for your son so those parts are yours for free 
 my boss while still a not so bad person he was <unk> strict and does n't like anyone failing to sell anything much less giving it away just like that but if we are not playing loud stuff on youtube or browse reddit we are cool i still could n't believe a boss like him had a heart he looked at me 
 & gt $ elboss : crescent go build his son 's pc 
 so i went to the back pick up the parts from the storage room and started working on it i grabbed that old hdd that still had windows 7 home installed got rid of anything but the os installed the rest of the parts <unk> 
 did n't take me long to finish and i hand the father the now <unk> pc and the father shook my hand and my bosses i could see happiness in his face 
 & gt $ father : thank you so <unk> señor and young lizard <unk> man thank you so so much you made me a very happy father and my son will be so happy as well 
 he left shortly after i did n't expect much but sometimes even us from tfts can have happy <unk> 
 edit : a couple of <unk> <unk> will be your new <unk> <unk> gim me <unk> tl dr : father ca n't afford a complete pc <unk> <unk> feels bad for him and gifts him the rest of the <unk> was trying to get this client to send a picture of a router to the support email 
 & gt me : send it to support @ genericnetworks.com & gt them : <unk> 
 & gt me : <unk> ... with an s & gt them : network & gt me : no networks with an s at the end 
 & gt them : ok 5 mins later have n't received it and i called them back : & gt me : did you send it to support @ genericnetworks.com & gt them : <unk> & gt me : it is <unk> ... .with an s & gt them : network 
 & gt me : spelled it out & gt them : is support with an s & gt me : **headdesk** run a computer repair shop in a small mountain town and i get some real gems in here 
 today i got yelled at by a customer for quite some time 
 yesterday this customer brought me this beige gateway windows me computer because the drive was clicking 
 no problem cloned the drive popped in the new one and it booted right up 
 charged them 95 for the service 
 they stop by i show them it works and they go on their way 
 then i get a call at the end of the day it does n't work we 're bringing it back tomorrow 
 huff puff huff huff '' 
 so they stop in today 
 the customer is fuming red in the face <unk> shaking 
 they looked like they were going to smash my display cases 
 they begin to scream you fucked up my computer 
 ten years and not a single issue and you broke it '' 
 so i calmly inquire what the nature of the issue is and i got a surprising response 
 i 'll save you the capital letters assume screaming you broke the damn thing 
 i brought it home and hooked it all up right and do n't tell me i did n't because i labeled every cable before <unk> it 
 i plugged it in and nothing happened 
 i unplugged it and plugged it back in a dozen times and nothing happened '' 
 okay ... maybe a power supply issue 
 let 's see 
 i toss it up on my bench and plug it into the kvm and press the power button and it turns on 
 all hell breaks loose 
 what was that 
 you pressed a button to turn it on 
 i never had to do that before 
 what the fuck did you do to my computer 
 you ruined it 
 that thing 's been running fine for 10 years and i never had to press a button 
 you screwed up the whole thing 
 i want my money back and a new computer '' 
 i 'm astounded at this point 
 i did n't know what to say 
 they had this computer installed by some guy years ago and never turned it off 
 they lacked such basic electronics knowledge that they had no idea what a power button was 
 i did my best to explain 
 you see this is the power button you have to press it to turn it on '' 
 but i 've never done that before '' 
 did you ever turn your computer off before '' 
 no '' 
 that 's an issue in itself 
 normally folks shut down their computers when they 're not using them '' 
 why in the fuck would i do that '' 
 to make it last <unk> hard discs are only good for about 10 years or so and <unk> do n't last forever '' 
 but it never failed before why would i turn it off '' 
 regardless this is how a computer works 
 you turn it off and press a button to turn it back on '' 
 no it 's not you broke it 
 fuck you give it back i 'll see you in court 
 i 've never had to press a button before this is <unk> fucking believable '' 
 so ... i 'm going to court apparently 
 they called the police and reported me got that call a minute ago 
 i 'm not sure if i should laugh or cry 
 **edit** : tl dr customer thinks i broke their computer because they have apparently never pushed a power button before 
 **edit # 2** : yes i know how insane the idea of a computer being on for 10 years sounds 
 that 's their story not mine 
 <unk> brought up the very valid point that the cmos could have been set to <unk> on ac failure to solve their issue 
 i 'm starting the <unk> that maybe it was already set that way and i may have cleared the cmos somehow but i do n't think so 
 my feeling is the woman is just a total bitch and did n't want to admit she was wrong when faced with something so obvious as a power button so she <unk> and followed through with her accusation 
 **edit # 3** : february 25th <unk> pm pst : her husband called today 
 he says i can avoid court by giving them a new computer and <unk> their 95 bucks 
 i ... lost my temper 
 **edit # 4** : on monday march 3rd i received a call from a lawyer '' who <unk> ms. <unk> who said they want to settle outside of court to save us both some time and money '' 
 i told him i am not willing to refund any money as the computer worked and that i do n't believe that he is a lawyer 
 i explained that the amount they would receive back is nothing compared to what it must cost to pay a lawyer to start a case 
 i <unk> him and have a suspicion they are the couple 's son or something 
 he said well we 'll have to settle in court then '' 
 to which i replied in small claims court 
 i 'm not sure you know how that works 
 bring it bitch '' 
 the next day i noticed a terrible review on yelp and i 'm more upset about my <unk> rating being in <unk> than anything else 
 the whole ordeal is going nowhere fast i 'm starting to hope i get served soon so i can just get this all over with 
 **edit # 5** : on thursday march <unk> i got served 
 <unk> of proof of that 
 <unk> 
 son 
 <unk> 
 bitch 
 **edit # <unk> : i get a lot of messages regarding another update 
 court is on the <unk> of april 
 no new news until then 
 **edit # 7 : the final update '' ** i 've just returned from court 
 i arrived there at <unk> for my <unk> appointment after grabbing a quick taco bell breakfast 
 this was my first mistake 
 the judge did n't enter the <unk> until <unk> and by then i had already begun to realize the problem i had created for myself when the woman next to me <unk> on my belly rumbling 
 man did i need to pass gas 
 but not here not now not like this '' 
 the judge sits down we rise i cringe 
 the judge sent the first four or five cases out for mediation as is the normal practice 
 now i 'm waiting for an <unk> amount of time but i knew what i had to do 
 i excused myself and wrecked the <unk> 
 with a certain amount of <unk> i returned to court and <unk> for the next hour waiting for my case another problem brewing 
 finally we are sent out for mediation at <unk> we climb a few flights of stairs to the <unk> office and start the discussion 
 immediately the <unk> starts ranting about this and that how i broke their computer how we had a verbal agreement that i would replace the computer '' we did n't 
 and how their son was <unk> certified in 1992 '' but with no point to follow that 
 they kept going for quite some time i do n't believe they know what a mediator is for they were acting like he was the judge throwing accusations 
 finally i could n't take it <unk> the gas not the unintelligent rants i 'm used to those 
 i interrupt with look you 're claiming $ <unk> worth of damages and i do n't believe you deserve a single penny of that your computer works plain and simple '' 
 yelling and ranting is what i get back 
 at this point i begin to realize i 'm arguing with <unk> and decide to get out of there 
 the mediator is <unk> his face in his hands he 's tired of this too 
 myself i could be making a couple grand this morning or be here battling a combination of idiots and <unk> 
 i needed to call this a loss and get out of here open my store 
 i make them an offer 
 i 'll give you a <unk> laptop and we 're even can we agree to that '' 
 oh wow really mister that 'd sure be <unk> 
 it 's funny how people change when they 're starting to get what they want 
 sure a windows 8 laptop why not 
 it 's almost new '' 
 they accept we write out the agreement and i make sure to have a clause put in there 
 <unk> will verify functionality of the <unk> 's provided laptop on site and once it leaves there will be no support for it '' 
 sweet they signed it 
 they try to make small talk with me so that 's your bike nice day for a ride etc etc '' 
 my mind screams insults while i smile and agree 
 so we go back to court have the case dismissed and i head back to the shop 
 i walk into the storage closet take a glance at the three giant racks with around 200 laptops on them grab the first one i see a toshiba <unk> machine i bought for 20 bucks from a <unk> who probably stole it 
 i boot it up it works factory reset it <unk> on windows 8 if you do n't have the password and give them a call 
 i 'm waiting for them to arrive now while i write this 
 in conclusion i lost on this one but i keep telling myself that i made the conscious choice to lose in order to <unk> my efforts and make more money than i lost on that machine 
 the entire ordeal has really made me <unk> my career in consumer product repairs 
 consumer electronic repairs has done little for me but turn me bitter and <unk> towards the end-users of a technology i find rather beautiful 
 so i 'm looking to hire somebody who loves computers to work full time in my place with options for room and board at the shop 's apartment upstairs 
 i 've been looking for <unk> for a month now and so far i 'm realizing that mountain towns do n't have much to offer in the way of computer techs who have any sort of background in repairs 
 myself i plan to move on to create shitty ios and android games that generate <unk> in ad revenue daily to fund <unk> in hardware development 
 **tl <unk> i felt <unk> so i rushed through things and gave them a windows 8 toshiba during mediation to stop the ranting and get back to work 
 total loss : $ 20 and 4 hours of my time 
 thank you for the gold kind stranger boss calls me 
 **bossman : ** my computer is running really slow 
 check the broadband 
 **me : ** err 
 ok broadband is fine i 'm in ftp at the moment and my files are transferring just fine 
 **bossman : ** well my browser is running really slow 
 **me : ** ok though you could just go to speedtest.net and test it takes less than a minute 
 **bossman : ** you do it please i 'm too busy 
 **me : ** ok hang on ... *2 mins later* **me : ** speed is <unk> up and <unk> down 
 we 're fine 
 **bossman : ** browser is still slow ... <unk> there a setting that 's making it slow **me thinks : ** yeah <unk> we always build applications with a 'slow down setting ... **me actually says : ** no unless your proxy settings are <unk> 
 that could be the issue 
 <unk> the bossman is notorious for not shutting things down <unk> **bossman : ** what 's a proxy ... 
 why do we need one 
 is it expensive 
 **me : ** first things first have you rebooted to see if that <unk> the problem 
 **bossman : ** nope i do n't do rebooting ... **me : ** err ... but it 's the first step in resolving most it issues ... **bossman : ** i have n't rebooted or shut down in 5 days ... why would it start causing issues now ... **me : ** face nestled neatly into palms ... edit : formatting and <unk> have a location with a terrible infrastructure 
 all the desktops are xp on terrible wifi adapters to get them to the network 
 i got a call from a user that your guy must not have set the printer up right '' 
 teamviewer was n't working so we figured out how to make sure he was connected to the internet 
 a bit of struggle later and i 'm actually in 
 i looked at the printer and it had a bunch of items stuck in queue 
 i found the ip address and went to the web interface 
 bam - giant error warning : put ltr in drawer 1. i told the user : looks like it 's out of paper '' 
 user : it printed fine this morning '' 
 me : which is why it 's now out of paper ... '' user : it 's all the way upstairs '' 
 me : you see this error on the screen right 
 put letter in drawer 1 
 i really think we need to start there before trying any more troubleshooting '' user : ugh - fine 
 i guess i 'll call you back when that does n't work '' me : & lt stays connected to the remote system to smugly watch the queue clear out a moment later & gt so this happened during my <unk> as an it tech with a german it <unk> taking care of small businesses and schools roughly 15 years ago 
 we had one special client funny job blasted old industry buildings and <unk> who had permanent issues with his online banking remember this was <unk> ago when <unk> banking was still done with the rsa keys on <unk> disks 
 regular procedure in case something went wrong with the key disk was to call the issuing bank to send the customer a new disk 
 we did this game several times including some test transfers on the customers computer : the tests went fine but within a week the customer complained again about the messy online banking '' 
 so after another <unk> rsa disk i decided to stay a bit longer after the tests were done and suddenly i got an <unk> insight on the issue 
 as the label on the disk clearly stated : keep in a safe place in german '' the customer used a fridge magnet to safely store the disk on the side of the pc casing 
 after a short discourse on <unk> <unk> we were able to focus on real '' issues 
 edit : formatting edit2 : as multiply requested tl dr : <unk> was a lot of interest in this part 2 and part 1 
 <unk> for the gold and stuff 
 one of the questions asked struck me and i thought i should answer it in a new thread 
 q : so what was my last day like 
 shortly before leaving i received a <unk> <unk> over a significant injury i had suffered a few years earlier 
 management found out about this and tried to <unk> trip me with you have a lot of money now and you do n't need money from us '' 
 then the issue of not buying the bosses car <unk> again 
 i was <unk> continuously for driving a <unk> <unk> '' <unk> or <unk> to the rest of the world 
 the boss started to insist again that i should buy his small car as it was a much nicer vehicle 
 my refusal not to buy his car with the reason i like my car more '' was taken very personally 
 we had agreed on two <unk> notice 
 i did not want to drag it out and they did n't want to <unk> more debt to me 
 so i did my time and built up a last vital patch to the software 
 on the second last day the patch was ready and all that was needed was to commit the code and do a final build 
 as i left that night something odd happened 
 i was cornered by management and asked to give up my office key i saw no reason not to so i did 
 i asked why they said they felt i would try and steal computers to recover unpaid wages 
 i basically said ffs 
 when the morning of my last day rocked round i was feeling <unk> 
 i was flush with insurance money a great new job lined up and my life was set for a brand new course 
 as i prepared to leave home a call came 
 & gt boss : do n't come in we will do your last day another time '' 
 & gt me : ok '' stupid me over the next two weeks a new date for the last day '' was set and <unk> often 
 eventually a last day actually happened i was instructed to turn up at 9:30 a half hour after opening 
 so i turned up to work as agreed 
 all the doors were dead locked 
 all staff were actually locked in the building 
 i knocked on the door and was escorted into the meeting room by my boss 
 some new faces were present everyone was in suits and the room was given an intimidating “you’re <unk> <unk> 
 a contract was placed in front of me 
 it basically stated that “i verified the software was 100 % bug free and i would fix any bugs found at any time in the future for free 
 i would to this immediately and without limit for time required to do so 
 this agreement would be <unk> without time <unk> i was told this was my exit contract and i had to sign it 
 i declined 
 instead in this <unk> environment i <unk> a consultant fee for any further work and a minimum 10 days a year <unk> against future requirements 
 i signed the new contract 
 they signed it and then <unk> it to when i first joined <unk> 
 i was then escorted to my office 
 while i was away they had been busy 
 the room had been turned upside down and my filing cabinet emptied 
 my computer had been reformatted and all software re-installed fresh 
 my computer had also been disconnected from the network and i was informed that all passwords had been changed so i could no longer log into anything 
 they informed me that when they rebuilt the machine apparently one piece of software failed to <unk> i was accused of doing <unk> that prevented this and blamed 
 i could not assist them the software key was on my company email account no longer available to me 
 they suddenly nervous and refused to let me access my e-mail account for the key 
 in a brief moment of privacy i discovered something from a friend 
 actually a massive network outage was in effect because a certain manager had taken it upon herself to <unk> the stack of network routers '' as a security <unk> against me making an imminent cyber attack on the company 
 now a familiar consultant joined us 
 his job was to read the code i was going to commit and ensure it was not malicious and verify the final build of the software still <unk> 
 the consultant felt very awkward about this he knew i would do no such thing but he wasn’t going to turn down work 
 the management was suspicious that the consultant trusted me 
 so they <unk> the consultant 
 so there i sat for an hour as three people looked over every move i made 
 management questioning every second action as i built the final release of the software 
 i then spent another hour in a random code audit 
 the consultant was to <unk> through the code looking for anything malicious 
 i was on hand to answer any questions he had 
 i was then promptly escorted out of the company 
 i never looked back 
 edit : i have finished the account here 
 previous _________________ christmas planning meeting number three 
 how many meetings can you have for a party 
 probably hundreds at the rate we’re going 
 as i waited for nice to arrive i was stuck in the room with head of security who had mysteriously decided to join the meetings 
 & gt hsec : while we’re waiting… i wasn’t pleased at his presence with him around coffee became <unk> 
 & gt hsec : last meeting i asked nice to go with me to the <unk> party 
 i sighed 
 it was one of those <unk> conversations 
 without coffee 
 & gt hsec : remember

 i tried to hide the smile that was building that was a pretty fun answer 
 & gt hsec : what does probably not '' mean though 
 & gt me : pffff… 
 hell if i know 
 & gt hsec : maybe you could… ask her about it 
 & gt me : why

 & gt me : sorry mountain dew 
 & gt nice : thats an it drink 
 mountain dew an it drink 
 and the base for our xmas punch 
 amazing 
 next another quick story from my time working at my university 's main computer lab 
 an old lady came up to my desk and told me her monitor was low on ink '' 
 i walked over and her monitors brightness was turned all the way down 
 i turned the brightness up and she said oh you young men are so smart '' 
 then she gave me some candy 
 she was <unk> just discovered this sub so i thought i would share 
 early one saturday morning 2am my on-call cell rings 
 i answer the phone and a co-worker who works on the storage team tells me the <unk> just went dark 
 i tell him just because a server loses connection to a network drive does n't mean the server went down 
 since i was a windows admin at the time my team was responsible for all the server hardware so i was the point of contact for emergencies that weekend 
 no the datacenter went down '' he replied irritated but i still did n't believe him ... it 's 2am in the morning and i 'm not thinking clearly 
 when he finally says i 'm in the server room and all the power is off every server is off '' 
 long story short i get dressed and make the long drive into corporate headquarters while calling other senior members on my team about the outage since this is a all hands on desk moment '' 
 everyone arrives in <unk> and we sit in the war room '' while senior managers explain something triggered the smoke <unk> so power was immediately cut 
 we walked though the data center and there was nothing visibly showing a fire no smoke no <unk> marks 
 the it director in his wisdom issued a <unk> 
 we will station admins at the end of every server and router row with <unk> and then turn on the power 
 we 'll see where the smoke is coming from and if a fire breaks out we can put it out '' 
 we all stared at the director and reminded him of the following 
 1 we have liquid <unk> 
 you want us to <unk> electrical equipment with liquid 
 2 the datacenter systems will automatically lock the doors then start <unk> out the <unk> 
 so to be <unk> you want us to <unk> ourselves while simultaneously <unk> '' 
 the it director was walked out fired 2 weeks later 
 <unk> of <unk> ... one of the four huge <unk> units began dripping oil 
 the oil hit an electrical outlet below the raised floor and the resulting sparks caused smoke ... not a fire 
 this was finally discovered via security recordings of the datacenter that happened to catch the rising smoke 
 simply turned off the effect ac unit and fired everything back up slowly 
 was a long day ... .. and lots of pizza 
 previous getting back to it i took a rest in my chair 
 i was tempted to put my feet on the desk probably not professional i thought 
 opening up the ticket queue i looked at the number of tickets pending 
 & gt me : oh what the 
 tickets had started piling up 
 looking out my office door it staff seemed to be relaxing 
 unconcerned about the mounting tickets 
 relaxing over 
 & gt me : what the hell is going on with the ticket queue 
 i shouted at it 
 they seemed surprised at my anger 
 itsec our newest it member found his voice first 
 & gt itsec : oh airz 
 welcome back 
 & gt me : thanks but what are you all doing 
 tickets are piling up and you’re all chatting 
 the other it staff gave each other a look 
 eventually itsec explained 
 & gt itsec : when the vp was in charge he made a new system see tuesday last week the sales manager rang him up to complain about how long tickets were taking 
 so now we just do four ticket <unk> a day 
 everyone got a memo saying if you get your ticket in before <unk> you’ll have a reply before 10am 
 <unk> for a reply before <unk> etc 
 see right now its only 9 o’clock so there’s still half an hour before the first <unk> 
 & gt me : why the hell would you do it like that… 
 nervousness swept over the it department murmurs of “it’s a good <unk> and “no complains so <unk> could be heard 
 however no one was openly talking 
 i glared at my staff for the laziness on display 
 i waited for a response 
 no one seemed keen to reply 
 & gt me : so if someone wants a password change at <unk> they get a reply at 12 
 <unk> insane 
 & gt colorblind : actually does seem to be a spike of traffic just after a cutoff 
 i think people like waiting… less work for everyone 
 he smiled at me 
 i couldn’t tell if he was happy about less work or just happy to be submitting an answer 
 & gt me : oh.. is that the goal 
 less work for everyone 
 silence 
 out of the corner of my eye i saw solitaire take his feet off his desk 
 next previous tuesday midday why are people happy on <unk> 
 it’s probably the second worst day of the week 
 ***** i’d been called up a users desk for a problem 
 <unk> problem 
 naturally 
 & gt me : so whats wrong 
 i looked down at the user in question his face old and greyed 
 & gt grey : are you the technology man 
 & gt me : yes 
 i’d never been called the technology man before it sounded like a super hero name 
 & gt grey : oh good 
 you know what all the children like right 
 & gt me : <unk> 
 what a strange question 
 i didn’t know how to respond 
 my mouth went dry as my eyes searched for an it related problem on <unk> desk 
 & gt grey : we’re getting school children to our department for a while 
 so… which background do you think is more children <unk> 
 & gt me : is this your it problem 
 i was pretty annoyed grey however was <unk> back and forth between pictures of nature and various cartoons mostly cartoons from the <unk> 
 i attempted to give grey a <unk> glare however he simply ignored my glances 
 eventually he <unk> 
 & gt grey : i also wanted your opinion on this… grey bend down and pulled out a usb floppy disk drive 
 he proceeded to plug it <unk> 
 & gt me : it seems to have died 
 & gt grey : my thoughts mirror your own 
 i was slightly confused to his <unk> 
 my brain took a second to recover 
 & gt me : what … do you use floppies for anyway 
 & gt grey : nothing is ever truly lost 
 not with me 
 grey walked over and opened up a nearby filing cabinet 
 it was filled with floppies 
 completely filled 
 & gt me : i’m impressed with your <unk> to data retention 
 however i must ask why not just save to the server 
 it gets backed up every day 
 it has multiple <unk> 
 grey looked confused 
 & gt grey : server … like someone that gets you food a <unk> 
 oh darn it 
 i then spent the next half an hour explaining what a server is and how it works 
 grey seemed very interested in the idea 
 & gt grey : so you can guarantee that if i save it in the server it’ll be saved forever 
 & gt me : yep 
 & gt grey : is that a personal guarantee young man 
 grey looked at me <unk> 
 i started to question not that the server would back it up but weather grey would save in the right place 
 & gt me : … err… i asked to borrow the computer for a second and checked online how much another usb floppy drive would cost 
 <unk> i realised it wasn’t worth giving out personal guarantees for only 25 euro 
 & gt me : you know what… i’ll just go get you another floppy drive 
 & gt grey : excellent 
 now… about these <unk> 
 nope 
 next *previous tales from dishonest used car dealership* /user/36055512/submitted/ this is it folks the last part of the last story from my days at dishonest used car dealership 
 it’s been a hell of a ride and i want to thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my cold black heart for coming along with me laughing at my dumb jokes and <unk> about the dark times 
 when i started posting back in february i thought it would just be a fun thing to write up a story or two while i was sitting on my <unk> waiting for a job interview and never expected anything approaching the kind of response i have received 
 and here we are at the beginning of october 26 stories across 27 posts more than <unk> words later 
 it has been a <unk> honor to get to share these little snippets of my life with you all 
 but rest assured the ducd saga may be at an end but after much <unk> i’ve decided to drop at least a story or two from the places i worked after 
 i can’t promise quite as much drama but we did get up to some nonsense 
 and thank you all so very much for all the kind words as i have shared these stories with you 
 i appreciate it more than you know 
 i do have one brief bit of business if you will <unk> 
 after many extremely kind requests to put my stories from ducd into a more permanent form i am actually getting off my lazy backside and doing something about it 
 i have gone and edited these stories into something a little more <unk> ” and as soon as i am happy with the <unk> i will be <unk> them in <unk> and <unk> formats 
 i’ll have more news about that very soon 
 anyway i now present the conclusion of the dishonest used car dealership saga 
 *** in the <unk> at dishonest used car dealership surrounding the departure of the diplomat and the <unk> of the owners filling in for our <unk> sales staff the one critical thing we absolutely required to do business had not gotten paid : our insurance 
 i can get cars fixed without running water or electricity 
 god knows i can do it without garbage pickup since we hadn’t seen a garbage truck in weeks 
 but insurance we had to have 
 we also now had a major <unk> situation as well 
 with lady <unk> having cost the company a good $ 10,000 on her car <unk> my former romantic <unk> medical bills to pay not to mention replacement shoes to buy and a <unk> <unk> that we were going to have to buy <unk> we had a lot of money about to head out the door 
 we also had no sales staff other than rom and the amazon filling in and were short two technicians 
 felonious monk should have been out of police custody already but he wasn’t 
 the police wouldn’t tell us much but the rumor around the shop was that he had failed a drug test while in custody and we would not be seeing him for some time 
 as with all rumors it was impossible to know whether it was true or not especially considering felonious monk always seemed pretty <unk> when drugs would be found in <unk> cars 
 at the same time he was also <unk> and didn’t think very far ahead so who knows 
 in any case we were going to be very far into the red with no real way to make it up any time soon 
 that monday morning rom and the amazon called an emergency <unk> meeting 
 we piled into the conference room not really sure what to expect 
 it certainly wasn’t going to be anything pleasant that’s for sure 
 we all sat down and the amazon broke the silence 
 & gt ta : <unk> morning everyone 
 i think we all are well aware of the events that have transpired recently and so i don’t think we need to <unk> the <unk> of the last few weeks 
 but as you are undoubtedly aware whether by accident or <unk> or incompetence the last few weeks have been extremely costly 
 however what most of you are unaware of is that our insurance company has terminated our policy which means the costs of these incidents will likely have to come out of our <unk> there was a <unk> among the technicians and miami vice 
 & gt ta : “we are currently in talks with our attorney as to whether something can be done about this situation but in the meantime we are going to have to tighten the belt considerably to <unk> lord salisbury spoke up 
 & gt ls : “what precisely does that <unk> ” & gt ta : “i’m glad you asked 
 colossal redneck rom and i have been discussing this situation over the weekend and we all agree that sacrifices will have to be made in order to keep this ship <unk> 
 most of these sacrifices will be minimal 
 to save some electricity we’re going to unplug the refrigerator in the shop and we’re going to ask that the technicians refrain from using the <unk> the <unk> <unk> or anything that runs off the phase converter 
 we’re also going to take a brief <unk> from <unk> things like office supplies - we’ll just have to use what we’ve got until we run out 
 we’re also going to clear out our used car inventory and not purchase any more cars at <unk> for a while 
 so most of the changes are going to be minimal and shouldn’t significantly affect the course of <unk> & gt ls : “that all sounds very good <unk> except there’s a word in there you keep using that makes me <unk> & gt ta : “and what’s that ” & gt ls : <unk> you keep saying <unk> of the sacrifices will be minimal 
 it’s that <unk> that’s bothering me.” & gt ta : “yes well as i said we are all going to have to make sacrifices if we want to stay <unk> lord salisbury was beginning to look irritated 
 mr. sarcastic spoke up in his place 
 & gt ms : “are you going to continue <unk> around and avoiding whatever it is you’re trying to say or are you going to get to the point ” & gt ta : <unk> 
 in order to ensure the company’s <unk> <unk> employees are going to have their <unk> suspended until this crisis is over 
 you will still receive your base pay 
 hourly employees - i guess that’s just miami vice - will receive minimum wage.” the technicians leaned back in their chairs and shook their heads 
 i was completely taken aback - the entire pay cut plan had certainly not crossed my desk - and in my surprise i spoke up 
 & gt me : “you’ve got to be f # cking kidding me 
 *this* is the plan you came up with 
 that is not a small pay cut you’re talking about here - it would be one thing to have some <unk> days or for us not to work overtime but that’s half my paycheck and it’s more like 75 % of the <unk> pay you’re taking away 
 not one of us had a damn thing to do with everything that’s gone down in the last weeks and it is ridiculous and entirely unfair to dock our pay to cover other <unk> f # <unk> & gt ta : “well you were driving the <unk> when it burned that <unk> & gt me : “yeah and when you can <unk> how her getting hurt was my doing let me <unk> & gt ta : <unk> i think you are failing to <unk> the magnitude of this <unk> & gt me : <unk> then 
 if the cash flow issue is that big tell me are you <unk> a business loan to hold us over 
 or perhaps you could sell or mortgage or rent out one of the three houses you two own 
 or perhaps rom could sell that <unk> gold <unk> on his wrist 
 or maybe you could flip some of our inventory at cost just to get some cash in hand 
 there are a thousand ways to solve this problem but what you’ve done is push the responsibility and the pain onto everyone but <unk> & gt ta : “now that is completely unfair 
 all of us are having to make <unk> & gt me : “really 
 so what kind of pay cut will the two of you be taking ” & gt ta : “i can assure you rom and i will be taking significant pay cuts as <unk> & gt me : “yeah 
 i’m sure you <unk> lord salisbury chimed in once again 
 & gt ls : “well i’ve heard about enough of this what about you mr. sarcastic ” & gt ms : “yeah i’m with you 
 this is bullsh <unk> lord salisbury reached into his pocket and fished out his keychain 
 he <unk> the shop key from the ring and thunked it on the table 
 mr. sarcastic followed suit 
 lord salisbury turned to colossal redneck 
 & gt ls : “post me my check.” colossal redneck stood from the table 
 & gt cr : “now wait <unk> a minute <unk> lord salisbury stood from the table and faced down colossal redneck 
 & gt ls : “post me my check.” rom seeing this jumped from the table and blocked the door with his body 
 & gt rom : <unk> of you are going <unk> lord salisbury whipped around to face him 
 & gt ls : <unk> 
 <unk> rom braced his hands against the door frame 
 & gt rom : “no one is leaving without my <unk> in all the time i had worked with lord salisbury i had never once seen him angry never once heard him raise his voice 
 he was the <unk> definition of the charming english gentleman 
 all of the sudden the lord salisbury i knew <unk> from the room replaced by some sort of <unk> demon 
 absolute fury washed over his face and his body <unk> 
 in a flash he reached out with his hand and grabbed rom by the neck and <unk> 
 <unk> eyes <unk> his terror and he tried to scream but lord <unk> hand crushed in around his neck 
 rom released his grip on the door frame and lord salisbury tossed him aside into a <unk> on the floor 
 the amazon shot up from the table but lord salisbury stopped her cold with a glare 
 his voice dropped into a deep <unk> snarl 
 & gt ls : <unk> 
 the f # ck 
 <unk> 
 *” she immediately retreated to her chair and lord salisbury stared her down for a moment 
 he turned and disappeared out toward the shop mr. sarcastic in tow 
 the room was in stunned silence 
 rom <unk> crawled back onto his feet and we sat for a moment 
 i finally threw my hands up in disgust at the whole thing and went back to my office 
 *** it was two hours later and i was in my office <unk> off a letter of resignation 
 i had already packed my things into a box taken down the <unk> off the wall and deleted anything good off my computer 
 i heard a knock on the door and miami vice slipped into my office 
 & gt mv : “look <unk> i don’t know how to say <unk> & gt me : “i think i know what you’ve got on your mind but <unk> & gt mv : “well i’ve been thinking about it and… it’s the pay thing… i can’t live on minimum wage.” & gt me : “i understand 
 do you have something else lined up ” & gt mv : “i just called a friend of mine he works at a bar up at the top of the lake 
 i guess they’re looking for someone to help in the <unk> i stood up and reached out a hand 
 & gt me : “you’ve been a <unk> employee 
 i’m sorry it came to this 
 let me know if there’s ever anything i can do for you.” he shook my hand 
 & gt mv : “it’s been wild it really <unk> i walked with him out through the bay and he disappeared beyond the sandwich shop toward the bus stop 
 a minute later two <unk> tow trucks rolled into the parking lot and idled up next to the <unk> bay door 
 mr. sarcastic and lord salisbury slowly rolled their enormous tool chests out toward the trucks 
 the tow truck drivers grabbed their <unk> cables and pulled the tool chests onto the trucks 
 the drivers strapped down their loads and the trucks pulled out of the parking lot toward their respective destinations 
 i ran into the shop grabbed three beers and <unk> the technicians 
 we cracked our beers and shared a toast 
 & gt me : <unk> it’s been an honor working with you 
 i just want you to know if you ever need a reference if you ever need someone to <unk> for your skills you have my <unk> we <unk> our beers and threw the cans into the back of colossal redneck’s pickup and the two of them got in their cars and drove out of the parking lot for the last time 
 i went back inside and printed my letter of resignation 
 i folded it in <unk> and walked over to colossal redneck’s office 
 & gt cr : “this here has been quite a day hasn’t it ” & gt me : “it has 
 this is for you.” i handed him the letter 
 he read it over 
 & gt cr : “you too huh ” i nodded 
 & gt cr : “i <unk> thought of everyone on the staff you <unk> been the <unk> one.” & gt me : “well i have a <unk> suspicion that i’m never going to see a paycheck from here again <unk> & gt cr : “what if i went <unk> got you yer paycheck right now <unk> outstanding would that up <unk> change yer mind any ” & gt me : “i got ta be honest you and i know that it’s just going to bounce 
 plus i ain’t gon na try and live off just my base pay from here on out.” & gt cr : “you and me we <unk> sort out yer pay rate 
 as <unk> now i’ll <unk> there’s enough money in <unk> the accounts ta cover what yer owed 
 gim me a <unk> colossal redneck disappeared down the street to the bank and came back a few minutes later with an envelope full of cash 
 he handed it to me 
 & gt cr : “that <unk> cover ya up to friday 
 how’s that sound ” i <unk> out the cash on the table and counted it 
 it was all there more or less 
 colossal redneck handed me back my letter of resignation 
 & gt cr : “i don’t suppose i’ll be <unk> this <unk> i <unk> it back on his desk 
 & gt me : “no i’m afraid you still <unk> & gt cr : “what 
 <unk> man ya’ can’t quit ya’ got yer money ” & gt me : “look around you man 
 we’ve got no technicians 
 we’ve got no sales people 
 it’s just you and me 
 now i don’t know what things look like from your <unk> point but this sure looks like a sinking ship from where i’m standing 
 you and i are clinging onto the top of the f # cking <unk> and you’re trying to tell me that because our feet are n't wet yet that there’s nothing to worry about 
 well i’m sorry but that’s bullsh t 
 there was a time when i worked here because i thought we were doing something special that we were selling really cool cars that were going to help save the environment that this was an <unk> business where i could build a career but those days are so far behind me they’re on the other side of the horizon 
 if i can’t even rely on my paychecks coming in then i’m not real sure what point there is to being here 
 how much more money is there to just up and hand out come payday 
 enough for a month 
 two weeks ” & gt cr : <unk> we all got ta make some sacrifices though 
 i mean y’all haven’t been the easiest employee and it seems like ya <unk> show some <unk> ya know ” & gt me : “if you think you’ve got to do the <unk> thing” and ride this ship all the way to the bottom you go and do that but i’m not about to sacrifice even one second of my life on some <unk> principle for two people who don’t have the slightest <unk> of what the words <unk> or <unk> mean 
 every f # cking day here has been a fight you and i have never received the slightest bit of respect and i’ll be damned if i’m going to sit here and have you try and tell me that i owe you or them or this f # cking company a <unk> <unk> colossal redneck looked down at my letter of resignation 
 he paused and then stood from his desk 
 & gt cr : <unk> he held out his hand 
 & gt cr : “it’s been terrible <unk> y’all as an <unk> i shook his hand 
 & gt me : “you’ve been a horrible <unk> he <unk> me and i grabbed my box of things and walked out the big bay door for the last time 
 *** epilogue : it was a month after i left ducd a <unk> cold friday afternoon and i was loading the last of my <unk> into a big box truck 
 on a <unk> i had applied at a job in a city about three hours away and strangely enough they had offered me a position 
 the pay wasn’t quite as good but it was a chance for something new somewhere new where i could clear my head and just start over 
 i had given notice to my landlord that i was leaving given away the things i didn’t need said goodbye to the few friends i had left and sold the jeep 
 as a final “f # ck you” to the dealership i had also dropped a dime to the county about the illegal dumping going on behind the shop 
 the pile had gotten bad enough that we had started calling it “the <unk> ” and between that and the dozens of gallons of old coolant and used motor oil the technicians had dumped on the ground back there the county had told me that they were <unk> interested in conducting an investigation 
 on the way out of town i made one last swing past the dealership just to see what had become of the place 
 i pulled off to the far side of the road and idled for a moment 
 the lot was very empty 
 rom and the <unk> car was there but no others i recognized not even colossal redneck’s 
 they had little inventory on display and even fewer cars that appeared to belong to customers 
 the service bay was shut tight and the lights were off inside the service office 
 as i idled rom and the amazon appeared from the sales office shouting at each other 
 the amazon got in <unk> face and screamed something then turned and marched back inside 
 rom stood for a moment and then started kicking a <unk> over and over again until there was a big dent in the back door 
 he stopped and stood there alone shoulders <unk> in the rain 
 i put the box truck into gear and pulled away 
 i turned onto the highway pointing the truck toward the edge of town 
 i switched on the radio and turned it to max slid the <unk> into overdrive and put the pedal to the floor 
 i drove south far beyond the horizon away from it all 
 many months later i came back north with a girl i was dating to show her the city that had defined so much of my <unk> a city that has so indelibly <unk> the very <unk> of who i am that all these many years later i still dream of warm summer nights windows down driving on the bridge across the lake that the smell of food still <unk> me back to the little <unk> bar just south of downtown the one i never knew the name of because the sign was in japanese windows <unk> from the warm <unk> and the cold rain 
 and to this day when i drive through the big city to the north i <unk> up and my voice catches because when i came the city broke me and <unk> me and made me new and when i left i left so much of me there 
 most of me still stands there on the pale <unk> on the <unk> feeling the wind just this side of cold looking out across the water to the <unk> beyond and watching the <unk> come in for the night as the sky turns orange then red then blue then black standing there waiting for the rest of me to come home 
 i turned off the highway in the big dodge i now drove and pulled into the <unk> parking lot 
 it was empty save for an abandoned <unk> decaying silently in a corner 
 the windows to the offices were hastily <unk> up and <unk> covered the bay doors 
 the sign for the dealership was <unk> from the rain and <unk> was beginning to grow over the letters 
 i drove around back and we hopped out of the truck 
 the empty lot behind the service bay had been mostly cleaned up 
 the girl looked around and turned to me 
 & gt <unk> is this place ” & gt ”it was a car dealership 
 i used to work here.” & gt ”it looks <unk> i gave the place one last look as i climbed back into the truck 
 & gt ”it was 
 it really <unk> is the year <unk> we have refurbished our boardroom and installed a lot of new gear including 2 60 '' screens the largest we could fit in the space a hub of sorts in the table that handles almost every type of connection one may need and a <unk> switching system that allows us to display any source on either screen via a nice <unk> remote control 
 this remote control is quite intuitive the home screen has buttons for the left screen and the right screen and pressing one or the other brings up the sources you can display 
 as part of the project i had to write an instruction manual for the new kit 
 i set this out in a <unk> format eg 
 preparing for a presentation using the boardroom laptop '' 
 this took the better part of 4 months to get right and it had to be right given senior management would be referring to it when setting up the room ... or so we hoped 
 in the nearly three years since i have received many many urgent <unk> to the boardroom because $ someone has a meeting in there in 5 minutes and they want to share their or someone else 's laptop display on a screen 
 no-one ever opened the instruction manual to my knowledge 
 cut to today 
 i am eyeing my ticket queue with some suspicion when $ exec <unk> my doorway 
 he informs me that he will be conducting a demo of $ system to a whole bunch of people in the boardroom and will need his ultrabook laptop to display $ system on the screen 
 $ system is <unk> and quite <unk> and these <unk> do n't have <unk> network or vga ports so i hand him a <unk> adapter and tell him where the boardroom 's <unk> adapter is kept 
 he leaves my office saying that he 'll come up again when his laptop is in the room so that i can set up the equipment 
 about 45 minutes later i realise that his meeting will start shortly so i <unk> down to the room 
 a screen is on there is a laptop screen on it and it matches what 's on $ exec 's laptop screen 
 & gt $ exec : hey yeah i 'm all good 
 i read the instructions '' 
 & gt me : y ... wha ... which instructions 
 those ones there '' 
 *points to the instruction <unk> & gt $ exec : yeah 
 worked well '' 
 never before have i had to physically <unk> myself from throwing my arms around another man 
 tl dr : some users actually <unk> 'm on my way into the office yesterday 
 at <unk> my phone rings 
 it 's $ userb : & gt ** $ userb : ** hey $ <unk> - we 've got an issue over here at $ office 
 $ usera 's signature pad is n't working 
 do you have a new one to replace it '' 
 *** $ me : *** * '' ok so this is the one she emailed me about on friday night - the email i replied to telling her i would call her as soon as i could on monday morning right 
 * & gt ** $ userb : ** yeah 
 so how soon before you can bring a new one over '' 
 *** $ me : *** * '' well i 'm actually still on the way in hence why i have n't called yet but let 's try some troubleshooting before we start swapping out hardware 
 i can walk you through a few steps before i get there 
 first things first - was anything changed or done on friday before this happened 
 * & gt ** $ userb : ** nope nothing at all 
 it just stopped working friday '' 
 *** $ me : *** * '' ok so what 's it doing 
 * & gt ** $ userb : ** well it lights up and you see the signature on the pad but nothing shows up on the pc '' 
 *** $ me : *** * '' ok try moving to a different usb port 
 * & gt ** $ userb : ** we did 
 we put it in another one in the docking station *and also in the <unk> 
 it still did n't work '' 
 *** $ me : *** & lt sigh & gt & lt <unk> & gt * '' alright try switching it with yours 
 i 'm almost at my office so i 'll walk across the parking lot to yours once i drop my stuff off 
 give me about 20 minutes 
 * naturally it 's about <unk> and it 's a half mile walk across the completely full parking lots 
 <unk> i hike over while <unk> the <unk> that seem to think a hospital parking lot is their personal <unk> 
 once inside i start talking to $ usera 
 we run down all the normal things : * did anything change of course not 
 * did you restart the machine of course 
 * did you swap out the pad like i asked of course 
 * well did the swapped out pad work on $ userb 's pc i do n't know why would we try that 
 his does n't have the problem mine does 
 & lt sigh & gt & lt <unk> & gt 
 i should mention that at this point $ usera lets slip that $ userc a.k.a the third <unk> downloaded and <unk> the software - so much for nothing had changed '' 
 alright let 's check the setup 
 sure enough the wrong <unk> pad is selected 
 i change it but still no luck 
 not knowing what version $ userc downloaded and installed i set about removing and reinstalling with the correct settings 
 all with no success 
 so the process of <unk> begins again 
 first things first - move the usb plug to the laptop directly instead of the docking station 
 & gt '' oh we already tried that it did n't work '' 
 <unk> $ usera 
 funny because now the signature pad works flawlessly 
 i’m guessing if they did test it they only did it after $ userc decided to fuck around 
 and remember i asked them to switch the pad 
 yeah somehow in their panicked state i 'm sure they remembered to <unk> the new pad down nice and neat 
 i 'm sure they did - why would they lie 
 but at least we 're getting somewhere 
 i move the usb to another one on the docking station 
 & gt ** $ usera : ** why are you doing that 
 just leave it in the other one since it works '' 
 *** $ me : *** * '' well we want to <unk> the actual issue 
 i need to know if the one usb is faulty or if it 's the whole docking station 
 * & gt ** $ usera : ** well it seems like a waste of time since we know it works now '' 
 as i ignore her and continue testing i see that her scanner is plugged in to the docking station also 
 naturally i inquire about its functionality 
 & gt ** $ usera : ** oh it 's working fine 
 the problem is with the signature pad 
 the scanner 's perfect '' 
 uh huh sure it does as the signature pad fails in another usb on the docking station 
 so for giggles i try the scanner 
 it 's a no go of course 
 & gt ** $ usera : ** funny it worked fine on friday '' 
 amazing just like the signature pad 
 so now i start to dig deeper for the root cause 
 everything else on the docking station is functional - ethernet video etc 
 just the <unk> 
 i <unk> my memory banks - power 
 i 've seen before where a docking station will drop usb performance if there is n't enough power 
 i look at the power brick 
 it 's the correct one for the docking station - it should be providing enough juice ... <unk> ... i trace the cord back to the power strip 
 and it looks a bit weird 
 weird because there 's a heavy duty extension cord plugged into it that runs behind a cabinet 
 i follow it around the wall 
 and there on the end of this heavy ass extension cord is a <unk> & lt facepalm & gt ... & lt <unk> & gt 
 *** $ me : *** * '' so has this been here long 
 * & gt ** $ usera : ** oh no we just added it on friday '' 
 i wait probably too long for $ usera to connect the <unk> 
 apparently that 's still beyond the capacity of her brain functionality 
 so i finally explain to all three <unk> that a refrigerator draws quite a lot of current and that by plugging it in to the power strip not only were they <unk> the docking station of the power they needed but were also creating a major fire hazard 
 the dull <unk> look in their eyes told me that i would be better off explaining it to the furniture 
 i told them they needed to move the fridge and check with facilities before they plug it in to see if their area even would support a small appliance and begin the game of <unk> back over to the safety and <unk> behind my office door 
 **tl dr : ** it 's like a screwdriver 
 just because it fits does n't mean you should stick it in <unk> : i am the <unk> of it at a resort 
 recently i walked in to my boss 's office she is part of accounting and had this brief conversation 
 & gt me : so i heard $ employee is no longer with us & gt & gt boss : that is correct 
 & gt & gt me : and she 's been gone a few weeks now 
 & gt & gt boss : also correct 
 & gt & gt me : so do you want me to i do n't know disable her network access 
 also you might want me to disable her email access since she has that set up on her personal phone and all 
 & gt & gt boss : ... yes please she is supposedly going to review the termination procedure with hr 
 i am waiting with <unk> <unk> breath ... edit : <unk> <unk> for the <unk> am not the hero of this story 
 that honour goes to /u/haakon666 my partner in crime and *more <unk> 
 have you ever been on call and had a fault come in and thought <unk> god i really can not deal with this right now 
 i 've been that guy 
 today i 'm that guy 
 i 'd recently said 'fuck you to working for other people and started my own business 
 /u/haakon666 and i had been idly discussing <unk> we might like to <unk> for about 6 years when it happened 
 i went out on my own at first and when we were making enough money he quit his job also and we went to work 
 but before that happened he helped out on nights and weekends wherever he could 
 it was tough going for both of us at first but it was worth it 
 when i started out i contacted all the companies i 'd done contract work for in the past and offered them support contracts 
 one in particular who i 'll call server tech did web hosting server rental and <unk> 
 they 'd been keen to support my <unk> but declined to move forward saying they 'd call when they needed something and deal with the cost later 
 we both knew they would when an emergency came such was the manner of our existing arrangement 
 we just did n't know how big 
 so when i found a missed call from server tech on a saturday morning and i was <unk> away setting up my <unk> at a camp site ready for a weekend off i called /u/haakon666 and asked him if he could call them to see what they wanted 
 i then promptly went back to my <unk> and proceeded to have a lovely weekend in the mountains 
 on sunday evening when i got back i thought i 'd ping him to see what they wanted and how it went 
 i could 've guessed any number of reasons they 'd call hell i could have sat there guessing for a whole week and not gotten it 
 server tech 's building had been bought by a 3rd party who had agreed verbally to let them renew their lease 
 the actual lease agreement however had not been signed 
 so when the day of the lease end rolled around no-one expected anything to change 
 they certainly did n't expect the new owner to cut all power and <unk> to the building 
 unbeknownst to server tech the new owner was planning on using his new <unk> to start a competing business using not only their floor but the entire building 
 and in one fell <unk> he 'd managed to knock their business entirely off the air 
 now we 've had some pretty tough jobs in our time but this one .. this takes the cake 
 while i was off <unk> up the forest air /u/haakon666 and the customer had : - located a suitable building for the new datacentre site - agreed to lease it - connected a wireless microwave link from a nearby <unk> to the new building - rented the largest generator i 've ever seen and more portable <unk> than an airconditioning convention - organised <unk> to cable up the new site - organised electricians to power up the new site - moved every single server network device and rack - <unk> them and finally got everyone back online 
 it was the end of sunday and they 'd just finished working but they were online 
 the customer base was n't happy but the story was so catastrophic that some of them just straight up did n't believe them turning up to the old site to complain to find it empty 
 the generator powered the site for over a month being <unk> every day until enough <unk> power cabling could be run from the grid into the building to power up the <unk> and finally have a completed site 
 i was stunned 
 server tech had managed to run up a bill close to $ 6000 of after-hours support time in one weekend but their business was alive and kicking so they paid it happily 
 i 've never been so glad to miss a phone call in all my life and to this day i look back at /u/haakon666 's dedication for inspiration because that motherfucker <unk> back to his day job the next <unk> 
 if i 'm tech support <unk> then he 's the terminator 
 -- <unk> plug for /r/chhopsky for other <unk> good times 
 fortunately nothing like this 
 nothing like this ever again <unk> <unk> thanks for the gold 
 edit i was recently hired by my university as a tech support drone 
 answer phones <unk> up the hill from the it department to the academic buildings to plug things in that sort of thing 
 since it 's a university i have to deal with <unk> professors 
 the worst kind really 
 last week i got a call around 2pm : me : hello it have you tried asking one of your students to turn it off and on again '' 
 <unk> : yeah hi i 'm having some issues with the ribbon could you come take a look at my machine '' 
 helpdesk policy : if a professor asks you to come look you go do it 
 i 'm actually glad about that one it usually <unk> me from trying to <unk> what 's going on 
 i assumed blindly that the professor meant the microsoft office ribbon 
 we upgraded to office 2010 at the beginning of last semester and some people do n't adjust well to change 
 we all know what happens when we assume right 
 yep 
 turns out ribbon '' meant <unk> ribbon '' 
 professor selectric was having trouble replacing the ribbon and type ball 
 lucky for him <unk> are a <unk> of mine and i had the selectric <unk> away in a matter of minutes 
 tl dr please send helpdesk tickets to our <unk> at <unk> <unk> and we 'll fix your <unk> within 24 hours i got a call earlier from a woman whom i 've personally witness her print out documents to scan them 
 she asks me do you know where last year 's payroll reports are 
 they are n't in the usual place on the network drive '' i reply with no '' 
 since i am just a consultant and would n't access payroll reports 
 she tells me i have to find the reports 
 the shredding company is due here shortly and i have to shred them '' stunned i ask her wait 
 you 're printing out the reports just so you can shred them '' 
 yes '' i reply with well if you ca n't find them i 'm sure who ever wants to print them ca n't find them either 
 so you do n't have to shred them '' that 's true '' 
 i am seriously contemplating telling the owner of the company as she 's in charge of bank <unk> and has other <unk> duties 
 she clearly does n't get how paper and electronic data <unk> 
 the heat of the summer had started to burn into the roof of the building forcing its occupants to move from hidden heaters under the desks to hidden fans 
 the air conditioner which and been <unk> on heat had been swung over to cool its increased rumbling a soundtrack to summer 
 with all these changes around the office managers also got in on the act 
 updated policy documents spun round the office 
 & gt leadone : milestones are essential to any project 
 leadone stood in my office with her hands on her hips 
 she looked disapprovingly down at my vacant stare 
 my mind was too busy to care about her trivial projects i was dreaming of the beach 
 perhaps a holiday 
 & gt me : yes 
 it slowly dawned on me that i’ve no idea what leadone was in my office for 
 it just seemed right to agree with the angry woman 
 i tried piecing the conversation together in my head but it was still filled with sand 
 & gt leadone : so you agree 
 & gt me : milestones are essential ... 
 & gt leadone : you’ll update me 
 how often 
 hourly 
 & gt me : err ... i thought to all the things it could do hourly 
 nothing came to mind 
 i had come too far into the conversation to admit i’d no idea what we were discussing 
 i was in too deep 
 & gt leadone : okay 
 i’ll get back upstairs and you make sure you update me hourly 
 we need to stay on top of this 
 & gt me : yes 
 hourly 
 on top 
 <unk> the conversation ended 
 as soon has she’d left the department i started searching for leadone’s most recent policy changes hoping for a clue as to what i was doing 
 i found one 
 recently leadone had been promoted to lead of development she was forcing through a number of measures to increase workplace efficiency 
 <unk> her <unk> with management 
 she’d announced a new tracking scheme <unk> at larger projects to keep them on track 
 to get the tracker up and running she wanted it to purchase a host of project management programs 
 i checked the prices and sent a quick <unk> email to leadone 
 which she prompt replied affirmative too 
 i frowned as i thought of the poor <unk> i was condemning by making this purchase 
 the screams of frustration and micromanagement haunted me as i made the relevant orders 
 **** a few hours later i’d forgotten the horrors leadone was soon to <unk> upon the development department 
 in fact i was relaxing in my office with a fresh brew a flights website clearly open 
 <unk> 
 ** came the angry voice from my door 
 leadone was standing with the air of a <unk> mother 
 she sauntered into the room with an angry tone 
 & gt leadone : it’s been three hours 
 & gt me : oh 
 the update yes 
 everything has been ordered 
 my words <unk> out as the overbearing figure of leadone surged forward with the look of teacher catching a naughty student 
 & gt leadone : hourly 
 i said hourly updates 
 & gt me : okay ... well we’ve ordered the software 
 when the payment has been processed they’ll ship it too us 
 so i’ll let you know when it arrives 
 & gt leadone : no 
 <unk> want 
 hourly 
 updates 
 as 
 agreed 
 leadone <unk> her words out like jabs 
 she had eyes that looked crazy you couldn’t argue with insanity 
 my mouth opened to retort but i could feel my coffee getting colder 
 i wanted her out 
 & gt me : i’ll update you hourly at the bare minimum 
 leadone seemed to smile her eyes fell back from the insanity and she looked normal again 
 & gt leadone : good i’ll eagerly await your updates 
 she walked off with a hum probably to find other people to harass into insanity 
 i popped open a new search tab and looked for an appropriate service 
 the dreams of beach holiday <unk> my mind 
 **** two hours later and i’d <unk> the design of an <unk> <unk> 
 i’d set a program to send a random vague message of “still waiting for the <unk> or “the software is in <unk> every 20 minutes 
 it had taken time to write a <unk> list of valid short phrases to choose from 
 the flight tab i’d left open had completely <unk> out 
 **** the next day as the software had still not arrived 
 i set the email <unk> to send a vague message every 10 minutes 
 just to be sure 
 **** the third day the software had was <unk> in transit 
 to make up for this i set the <unk> to go off every 5 minutes 
 i didn’t want leadone to not be in the loop 
 **** the software didn’t arrive for an entire fortnight 
 when it did arrive oddly leadone never came to consult about the next step even after repeated emails 
 leadone’s project was canceled eventually 
 i <unk> it up to lack of proper management 
 if only our company had some sort of tracker to check up on these things ... <unk> 3 weeks after starting a casual role at my current job at a it help desk i got a call from one of our customers who immediately demanded 2 new phones as their ones were n't working 
 i was still in training while this happened 
 my job at the desk was to help troubleshoot and determine the <unk> and if it is equipment fault then i send for replacements etc 
 the call went like this : me : company name it helpdesk how can i help 
 customer : hi i want two new phones thanks 
 me : sorry which site is this for 
 customer : site i need two new phones 
 my phones are n't working so i need two new phones to arrive by tomorrow thanks 
 me : sorry i 'm just going to need you to do some troubleshooting with me is that alright 
 customer : look i need two new phones 
 my ones are not working and we usually just call you guys to get these replaced so i 'd like two new phones here by tomorrow morning thanks 
 me : sorry sir when you say not working what do you mean 
 customer : it 's not bloody working 
 i ca n't hear anything 
 i need two new phones sent out to me 
 we get it through you guys so i 'd like you to send me two new phones 
 me : so you ca n't hear the dial tone 
 customer : no because it 's broken 
 both of them are broken and i need new ones 
 at this point my mentor tells me to transfer the customer over to her and i tell the customer i 'm escalating to my mentor 
 my mentor picks up and i hear the customer start to rattle off about the broken phones 
 my mentor cuts in and says hi customer name your site currently has no phone or internet connection because the isp is working on the lines near your site 
 your site called about 30 minutes ago to inform us that there is was an outage and we 've followed up with the isp and will update you when we get updates from the isp '' 
 he was the one who called us regarding the outage 
 **tl dr : ** i 'm supposed to fix bugs not change <unk> 
 fridays at <unk> are strange <unk> 
 they are either the calmest or the busiest and <unk> day of the week 
 never anything in-between 
 <unk> 
 *** & gt me : hey man what 's up '' 
 & gt accounting : hi can you teach alice how to do an invoice '' 
 & gt me : the answer is no 
 what for anyway '' 
 & gt accounting : well bob is out of the office and alice does n't know how do an invoice '' 
 & gt me : so alice who has been in accounting for upwards of a year has never been taught how to do an invoice '' 
 & gt accounting : that 's correct '' 
 & gt me : and bob whom i know has a very precise invoicing procedure involving many different <unk> for all sorts of <unk> customers has not taught alice about this procedure as a back-up measure '' 
 & gt accounting : that 's right '' 
 & gt me : and we know that bob will raise the fires of hell if he finds out that somebody did an invoice without following the procedure '' 
 & gt accounting : well yes ... '' & gt me : and your first thought was to ask it which is entirely far removed from all <unk> of accounting to teach someone how to make an invoice '' 
 & gt accounting : kind of ... '' & gt me : is bob on vacation '' 
 & gt accounting : no '' 
 & gt me : when 's he back '' 
 & gt accounting : monday '' 
 & gt me : thank you i have all the information i need 
 the answer is *hell* no '' 
 <unk> previous first thing monday morning i found myself underneath the desk of an employee 
 & gt me : you’ve a lot of stuff plugged in under here 
 my face was inches away from three power strips all daisy chained together 
 every port was filled with various chargers printers and screens 
 i <unk> myself out from under the desk and quickly snatched up my monday morning coffee 
 the employee looked expectantly at me he wasn’t happy 
 i looked around the office and saw the grumpy employee’s manager 
 he was struggling carrying a few boxes it wasn’t the right time to call him over 
 yet 
 & gt mondaygrump : so… 
 mr. expert 
 why 
 why is my computer occasionally shutting off 
 & gt me : you’re overloading the power strips 
 probably drawing too much power through the first one <unk> it 
 i looked around his desk at the various chargers and devices 
 none seemed particularly power <unk> & gt mondaygrump : you say that with such certainly 
 like i said before however i can’t be overloading them i’ve calculated 
 mondaygrump pushed a piece of paper towards me 
 it was filled with various numbers with addition and <unk> 
 i opened my mouth to explain for the fourth time that perhaps plugging the computer directly into the wall and seeing if that would work is perhaps a good idea 
 the words however would not come out i had tried too many times already 
 i looked around for the manager 
 i caught sight of him in the break room making coffee 
 it would be too mean to call him over mid coffee… i thought as i sipped my own brew 
 & gt me : i can see you’ve put a lot of effort into your <unk> i caught sight of one of the numbers 
 i stopped talking instantly 
 & gt estimated power draw for coworker - <unk> 
 & gt mondaygrump : well if you can’t even argue with the numbers like a <unk> & gt me : wait 
 whats *this* <unk> 
 mondaygrump pointed me to the first power strip 
 first plug 
 i followed that plug 
 it went to **another** power strip 
 & gt me : oh come on 
 & gt mondaygrump : whats wrong 
 i looked at the <unk> of daisy chained power strips underneath his coworkers desk 
 & gt me : she’s drawing well over 400 watts 
 & gt mondaygrump : is she 
 his face was <unk> 
 i was taken aback at how happy he seemed 
 he dove underneath the table with me and started chasing wires and counting <unk> 
 & gt me : err… 
 i stood up from underneath the desk 
 i decided to wait this one out 
 eventually mondaygrump crawled out from underneath the desk 
 he looked at me with a smile 
 & gt mondaygrump : nope 
 nice try though 
 combined we’re still <unk> & gt me : can’t we just try plugging the computer straight into the wall 
 mondaygrump shook his head 
 & gt mondaygrump : we need to solve this mystery 
 where is your sense of duty 
 i looked up for his manager this time i caught sight of him he was oddly mid <unk> with another employee 
 i decided not to call him over mid hug 
 & gt me : its monday morning 
 i tried to stifle a yawn by drinking some coffee 
 at that time <unk> co worker turned up 
 she was wearing a very long dress 
 she sat down at her desk and turned on her computer 
 & gt longdress : hey what cha all doing 
 & gt mondaygrump : nothing just power stuff 
 you know… men <unk> mondaygrump was smiling at longdress who was <unk> smiling back 
 i got a <unk> vibe that i didn’t care for… & gt longdress : well don’t mind me 
 longdress proceeded to <unk> underneath the desk for a second 
 then popped back up 
 & gt mondaygrump : so… what’s wrong with it… & gt me : you’re overloading the power… 
 longdress looked up from her desk 
 & gt longdress : oh no 
 he can’t be… i’ve checked that… she <unk> around in her desk for a moment and pulled out a piece of paper 
 it had a bunch of numbers with plus signs etc 
 & gt me : you two are … longdress reached down between her legs and suddenly the computers all turned off 
 & gt grumpymonday : see 
 they’re always turning off just like this 
 & gt me : wait… what did you just do 
 i stared at longdress 
 & gt longdress : turned up the heater a <unk> & gt grumpymonday : heater 
 since when did you have a heater 
 i smiled and wrote <unk> <unk> at the bottom of the page 
 job done 
 & gt longdress : i hide it under my dress so i can get warm air 
 you’re always making a fuss about peak power usage 
 i just want to be warm ... & gt grumpymonday : those things are huge loads they’re <unk> 
 & gt me : sorry to interrupt 
 but i’m gon na go… as i turned around the manager of the department was standing behind me 
 & gt manager : everything fixed 
 i looked at the two people fighting behind me 
 & gt me : yep… kinda 
 mostly 
 & gt manager : twenty years of <unk> will do that to you… 
 they should probably hug it out that 's what i did whenever i had an office argument with my wife 
 oh they’re married 
 right 
 & gt manager : almost a shame we don’t work together anymore 
 office hugs are fun 
 the manager looked happy however i was too busy trying to work out who he was <unk> before… 
 & gt me : im just gon na … go… i drunk my coffee as i left the department and tried to remove the bad taste that place left in my mouth 
 next i keep telling myself i have to post more of my stories but i 've had a <unk> day so i 'm going to cheer myself up by posting an old problem 
 this is from about 8 years ago and as for the background i had been doing tech support for end users with printers for about a year or so 
 customer calls up gives me his details and i start generating a case 
 i got a bad feeling about this a few minutes in where he cuts me off while i 'm talking to tell me you have to speak up i 'm at a train station '' 
 great 
 so he 's nowhere near the machine if we need to check anything 
 plus i ca n't compete with the noise of a train so while i do speak up i 'm not shouting like he would like 
 i get round to what the problem is : i bought printer x a few weeks ago to print out notes for my university course 
 i 'm studying law 
 it says on the box the toner in it lasts for <unk> pages as a rough memory i ca n't recall the numbers exactly 
 i 've done about 250 pages of printing because i need notes 
 i 'm studying law so they are quite important 
 anyway the machine tells me the toner has run out 
 but i 've only done half a ream of paper so i know it 's ca n't be true '' 
 this is not a shocking question as people have got this before but 4 times the speed of it being used is surprising seeing its a cheap desktop black and white machine that will often not get much use 
 i start to ask questions regarding the usage : that expected toner life is based on constant printing and more importantly only covering 5 % of a page 
 i remember a flat mates law notes and ask how much he is printing on the page : they 're law notes 
 i 'm studying law so i have a lot of notes to review 
 i 've got reasonable eyesight so to save <unk> around heaps of paper i <unk> it all onto a page at about 5 point font '' 
 so if you hold a page at page at arms length it probably looks like a <unk> black colour all over the page right 
 due to all the text '' 
 sound of <unk> paper yeah pretty much ... it 's law notes so it 's all very important '' 
 i go on to explain how usage like that is going to drain the toner quicker than expected 
 he 's not happy and wants to check the numbers as well as what i am saying about the usage 
 i direct him on where to get the coverage information from the machine and where in the manual it explains the link between coverage and the toner life 
 he goes quiet and makes notes through this confirming page numbers and a few other things 
 he starts talking about what i 'm telling him ca n't be legal 
 he knows these things apparently 
 i explain that if he has numbers that do n't match what i said to let me know and we can look into it further 
 he 's not happy but ends the call 
 i note it in the system and go on with my day ... two days later ... customer calls back again from a train station 
 he starts ranting immediately and i end up not being able to get any details out of him but dig up the customer notes in the system when i realise it 's the same guy 
 he has checked the numbers and he 's been doing 25 % coverage or something like that 
 the machine has printed something just above 200 pages 
 at a glance these numbers seem right to me 
 but he wants free stuff 
 i 've wasted a lot of time finding this out and still ca n't print 
 you need to send me toner to fix this fault '' 
 it 's not a fault 
 he used the toner a lot and got his usage from it 
 more to the point i find he actually has a small amount of toner left and the machine is just giving him a low toner message 
 i explain the maths and he insists that even though the matches works someone at the store should have warned him law notes use a lot more toner than other subjects because he told them several times he was using it for notes 
 i explain that unless he showed them what he was printing they may not have realised what he was going to use it for 
 but he told them several times he was studying law really 
 so they should be prepared for this 
 at this point i know i 'm in the right so tell him he is n't getting free stuff he has to buy new toner and at his current usage a replacement toner will last him x number of pages 
 he does n't like this and hangs up 
 i check his details find which distributor sent the machine out originally and forward some notes to our sales rep for that group just in case it comes up 
 sales rep in question is pretty good with usage and things like that and he basically replies that he <unk> he will hear about it but will keep it in mind 
 about an hour later he comes and sees me 
 a store just called to report this guy called them trying to make a complaint then threaten legal action for <unk> the product '' 
 the store had told him he was n't getting free stuff either so he hung up and they called the sales rep to ask if they were going to get in trouble from this guy no we have notes already 
 he threatened legal action 
 did you know he 's a lawyer '' 
 i grumble and add some more notes to the system 
 i do n't hear anything for the rest of the week until monday morning ... first call of the day a co-worker answers and we can all hear shouting the moment he picks up 
 he tries for a few moments then spins around in his chair it 's for you '' i get a call transferred to me and behold it 's the law student now arguing that the <unk> do n't fill properly 
 we 've already guessed that he did n't buy a new toner so i 'm trying to get him to tell me how he refilled it 
 because at this point i suspect he has either got a non genuine item not supported or possibly even refilled with inkjet ink it 's happened in the past and <unk> not supported 
 it 's not refilling with paper ash '' 
 wait ... what 
 i spent two hours on the weekend sending through blank pages for it to burn with the laser and fill the cartridge again 
 it 's not burning the paper and it 's not refilling the toner '' 
 at this point i stand up so my supervisor can see me over the partition and hear me 
 the co worker from earlier looks up as well to see what 's happening 
 i want to make sure i have witnesses to this 
 so you 're telling me that in order to refill the toner cartridge you 've been sending through blank paper under the impression that toner is paper ash and doing so will let the machine burn the paper and create a new source of toner for you <unk> it back into the cartridge and letting you keep printing '' 
 customer sounds smug yes 
 i did my research 
 i know what i 'm doing 
 i found out how these things work '' 
 i make eye contact with everyone who i can see as they are mainly trying to hold back laughter 
 no 
 that 's not how it works at all 
 i suggest you buy a new toner and install it when prompted 
 this machine will not create new toner for you '' you ca n't tell me that 
 i 'm going to be a lawyer 
 i 'll take you to court over this '' 
 in which case i will repeat what i have told you the last few days in front of everyone assembled 
 that is not how the machine works 
 you have used your toner and need more '' 
 customer grunts and ends the call 
 to this day i have not been asked to appear in court for this ... a few months ago i got an emergency call from a customer because the core switch cisco <unk> at a school was down 
 symptoms : switch would boot up experience a crash then reboot 
 over and over and over again 
 after some troubleshooting it 's obvious that the problem is bigger than just corrupt firmware the supervisor is damaged and possibly even the <unk> 
 & gt me : so what happened 
 & gt <unk> : power outage 
 & gt me : i thought all of the core network gear was on ups 
 & gt nt : well there was a ups but they unplugged it 
 & gt me : who unplugged it 
 & gt nt : the principal 
 it started beeping last year so they unplugged everything from the ups and powered it off 
 & gt me : *facepalm* so someone whose networking knowledge barely covers the configuration of a residential wireless router took it upon themselves to disconnect a $ <unk> switch from the only thing keeping it safe from texas summer power <unk> 
 this resulted in the school being down for a day and a half while it tracked down new equipment because years ago someone else decided to save money by not <unk> maintenance contracts 
 of course the school blames it because they should have just <unk> that the ups was bad and they should have fixed the switch faster 
 tl dr it 's easier to buy a new car than it is to change the <unk> at the helpdesk i was helping get an old professor set up on his new computer after a complete data transfer 
 he opened it up logged on and immediately brought up finder and started frantically searching for a file 
 i noticed he was holding his breath 
 then he located a particular video and let it out with a long sigh pressing play '' and entering full screen 
 it was an old woman wired up to a host of machines breathing heavily looking right at the camera 
 the professor turned to me and said this is the only file i wanted 
 it 's my last conversation with my wife before she passed away from cancer '' 
 after he left i had to take a few minutes to <unk> myself 
 gosh 
 edit : wow 
 i did n't expect this response at all 
 i 'm glad you all like happy stories : i think that everyone who works tech support agrees that it 's what keeps us going : if anyone wants to read something from the complete opposite end of the spectrum i also just wrote this up : <unk> 
 <unk> telco has lots of people <unk> phones in a myriad of departments 
 sometimes things are <unk> than usual on key lines ranging from sales to tech support 
 that 's when hr-logistics where i work start handing down orders to cut corners to save seconds in every way possible 
 at tech support high call volume is common for front line staff when we have sudden <unk> technical problems 
 <unk> in calls waiting and the tickets front line file about them is key for senior staff to rapidly identify the problem s and get the ball rolling on a fix 
 we also use <unk> scripts that check frontline 's logged tickets every couple minutes and report unusual volumes in any ticket <unk> 
 selecting categories is one of the first things done during a call so we often pick up on a new problem within 5 minutes thanks to this 
 used to be that during a spike in calls hr-logistics would only send people in call centers emails asking to avoid doing anything but taking calls until further notice use cold transfers in-between departments instead of politely conferencing offer unlimited overtime to everyone who is in a position to take it if their shift is about to end and other reasonably sane things like that 
 but the 'special efficiency measures as they call them got worse and worse 
 floor managers were to ask politely if you 'd agree to delay your <unk> till later if lines were deep red - they ca n't order you to according to the work contract but they tried <unk> 
 then they started offering to pay overtime to people willing to forgo their lunch break <unk> 
 they started <unk> bathroom breaks while deep red to make sure they were n't <unk> abused 
 then they told front line to ask customers whether we could have a <unk> call them back in a couple hours if their issue was clearly going to take a long time to fix 
 then they finally went a bridge too far adding to their orders ... & gt 'due to high call volume stop logging tickets immediately until further notice 
 ... tsss was dumbfounded when we read that 
 on one hand this was hr <unk> acknowledging our ticket system is slow and inefficient 
 it 's always been awhile back they spent a few millions trying to improve it and it somehow got worse 
 some <unk> suit up in his <unk> tower figured out we could <unk> a minute off wrap-up time anytime we do n't file tickets about why customers called us 
 it might even kind of make sense in some other departments but not at tech support 
 we rely on that data to pinpoint issues and outages and keep track of repeat callers 
 it 's invaluable data 
 not only would this hurt troubleshooting it really would n't improve their holy <unk> handling time 
 front line techs during outages hate the speed at which they 're expected to take calls and if they have an extra wrap-up minute here and there to use while staying within expected metrics they spend it cooling down not taking an extra call 
 since this crazy directive came up from on high i first sent up the food chain a lengthy polite explanation of why we need the tickets at all times how not having them hurt our ability to efficiently solve the issue and why this was a particularly bad way to save time 
 hr-logistics immediately <unk> by editing their 'special efficiency measures template ... & gt 'due to high call volume stop logging tickets immediately until further notice <unk> specifically instructed to by your department 's senior staff or your immediate <unk> 
 ... which not only did not in any way solve the issue or respond to any of my points 
 it in fact made things worse as we started getting escalation calls from techs who wanted to ask us permission to file a ticket for issues <unk> 
 the next time we got a temporary order to stop logging tickets i immediately sent a reply to every group working at tech support <unk> all departments not under our purview and hr-logistics using tsss <unk> emergency procedures email 
 this meant about a thousand people including contractors and the department 's lower and <unk> would see it 
 & gt tsss : in compliance with the special efficiency measures tsss <unk> that everyone at tech support under our purview keeps logging tickets for every single call 
 failure to do so would <unk> <unk> our ability to address current issues in a timely fashion and would negatively impact our overall customer experience and satisfaction '' 
 if you 're likely going to piss off management in writing throw in a couple <unk> it makes the <unk> much easier to swallow for them 
 i thought i was basically <unk> them over this nonsense 
 i figured it would make enough waves that they 'd have no choice but debate it and likely review their procedure though it could put me in a little bit of trouble to practically just <unk> <unk> ignore hr 
 union job security <unk> me enough leeway to poke anyone in the eye if need be but i was definitely expecting some minor fallout 
 i was ready for pretty much any scenario aside from everything going well 
 i was expecting to be told <unk> is n't what was meant you ca n't just tell everyone to just ignore the directive 
 <unk> and yet stuff around here works in mysterious ways 
 not only did no one question my email everybody complied and all went well 
 and at the next tsss meeting ... & gt frank : so that email bytewave sent during the last outage 
 it helped <unk> 
 we 're utterly <unk> if we do n't get tickets during outages 
 i suggest we add procedures for whoever is handling the tickets to send the same email should this directive be sent to tech support 's frontline again in the future '' 
 & gt my boss : yes 
 as long as hr 's email has the language saying senior staff can grant instructions on the matter i expect a copy of that email to go out within 5 minutes tops every time we get this set of 'special efficiency measures 
 we really need the tickets it 's a core business <unk> priority but i 'm told the order not to file tickets will stay in their template - no more information available '' 
 everybody nodded or shrugged and that was it 
 i tried not to seem too surprised 
 whenever tech support is swamped and they hand down emergency orders to temporarily cut corners it 's now *on the books <unk> for tsss to reply asap and tell frontline to ignore the part about not filing tickets on our own say so and everybody is fine with that - yet we ca n't get hr to not ask in the first place 
 <unk> 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 using <unk> using <unk> hello tfts 
 i 'm a software developer currently working in london but for several years i worked in another more sunny country 
 this tale dates back to that time 
 i was employed by a <unk> at the time being such a big company the management '' section of our headquarters had more people than the actual engineering section or the marketing section or any other section you can think of and rumors were that it was because any <unk> manager would hire friends and family giving them a role in management '' even when the company was cutting down on new hires 
 what they did in that section consisted basically of <unk> <unk> filling out excel spreadsheets for every single task from keeping track of expenses to tracking down how many plastic cups were in each coffee machine every friday no i 'm not kidding all the developers including me have been called more than once to design a new spreadsheet for x task '' 
 i usually did that without thinking about it too much : it did n't happen often i could wait until i had finished whatever more important project i was working on at that moment and usually never took more than 15 minutes to prepare the spreadsheets with the correct <unk> 
 they could probably do it themselves if they spent a bit of time googling <unk> <unk> to excel but i figured it was n't really an issue to help 
 the coffee machine was placed right beside the door to the management offices so whenever i was on a coffee break i could actually see and hear what was going on in that office 
 there was this one time when i overheard the following conversation going on between a guy and a girl in management : she was sitting at the pc typing and the guy was standing beside her desk with papers in his hands telling her what to write : & gt guy : on <unk> it 's <unk> & gt girl : *types* & gt guy : on <unk> it 's 200 & gt girl : *types* hmm hmm ... & gt guy : on <unk> it 's <unk> & gt girl : *types* ok ... repeat for another <unk> cells all on column b & gt guy : ... and on <unk> it 's <unk> 
 & gt girl : *types* done 
 now the total 
 & gt guy : <unk> out a desk <unk> and starts <unk> yeah let me just make the sum and i 'll tell you what to type on <unk> 
 **edit** : formatting i fail at it.i work at a large tech company and was just taking some typical tier 1 calls when suddenly : *ring* me : hello this is $ me how can i help you today 
 customer : what the hell did you guys do to my mozilla 
 me : what seems to be the issue 
 customer : every time i open mozilla it just goes to $ <unk> 
 i want you to remote in now and fix it 
 i tried to explain to the man that mozilla is a company and that firefox is a web browser and that it was perfectly normal for him to be seeing web pages while opening this application 
 customer : well i never asked for firefox to be installed on here 
 where is my mozilla 
 i was in shock 
 i kept trying to explain the idea behind a web browser but he was not having it 
 i finally got into his computer and saw that indeed firefox was working as advertised but this was unacceptable to him 
 finally he demanded that i bring back mozilla 
 i <unk> to the mozilla homepage and made it his homepage and he was delighted that i had fixed his issue '' 
 he even called me a miracle worker '' 
 i sometimes get frustrated with every day users and then i realize that it can always be worse 
 i did this call about ten 10 years ago 
 the complaint was the printer would not continue printing while the secretary went for lunch and that even if she stayed on her station during her lunch break it still refused to print until her lunch period ended 
 i arrived early because they had other problems in different parts of the company to work on 
 i first checked out the secretary 's printer it was a light <unk> hp model i ca n't remember the model number and it was printing fine 
 the secretary then joked that i should come back just before noon and the printer would stop working just like the janitorial staff would do at noon 
 i came back just before noon and did a test print it worked ok. i then spent some time checking that the computer 's printer settings were correct they were then tried test printing again 
 there was no printing coming out 
 there also were no error messages just a <unk> printer 
 tested it again and then after checking the computer found the print jobs were still in the print <unk> 
 i looked at the printer the <unk> white printer the <unk> white printer 
 i looked up to see a <unk> directly overhead the printer 
 i then just held a file folder over the printer and it started printing right away 
 it did not take much checking but it seemed the bright sunlight entered thru the cooling slots on top of the printer and tripped so many of the sensors inside that printer did not even produce an error message 
 once i showed the secretary how to block the light entering the slots so she could print but also explained why she could not just leave the folder over the cooling slots her problems were solved 
 ps 
 this problem only occurred in summer for just a few weeks then the sun had shifted enough that the printer could once again work all day 
 i do onsite tech support for a large bank 
 my co-worker we 'll call him bob and i cover an area that includes 72 locations some are really close some are about 3 hours away the rest are in between 
 one sunday a really bad <unk> rolled through our coverage area a few of our locations lost power so bob and i were expecting a fair amount of calls on monday 
 we get to the office monday morning and over the course of the day we end up with about 25 calls in four separate branches for equipment that got fried by the power outages 
 we spend the entire day loading software on pcs <unk> displays and local printers and calling our various branches to let them know that we would be out on tuesday 
 tuesday morning rolls around and we meet at the office and load up our cars with equipment for the day 
 we leave going in the same direction after about 45 miles he was going to go south and get 2 of the branches and i was going to go north and get the other 2. about 10 minutes after leaving the office bob calls me 
 <unk> meet me at that gas station up the road '' 
 we meet and he tells me that he has to go 2 hours in the opposite direction to replace a down switch tickets like those take priority over any others 
 we transfer his equipment into my car i wish him luck and we part ways 
 while he was on the road he called his 2 branches and let them know what was going on and that i would be out in the afternoon 
 i get to my first 2 branches and things go ok. i head south to go to the branches bob was supposed to visit 
 i get to the first one and it was a mess 
 one of the replacement pcs would n't come up so i had to <unk> a working replacement from all the bad ones we picked up 
 i finish up and realize that i 'm not going to get to my last stop before they close not a huge problem since i have after hours access 
 i call them up and tell them what 's going on and they 're cool with it then i ask them if they can mark the bad equipment for me so that i do n't have to stumble around in the dark trying to figure out what i have to replace 
 again no problem they 'll have them marked when i get there 
 i arrive at the branch about 30 minutes after the last person has left i carry my equipment into the foyer and then i see it 
 there is a fun size candy bar laying on the floor of the foyer 
 i figure someone had just dropped it as they were leaving 
 i go through the doors into the branch lobby and then see another tiny candy bar right inside the lobby 
 i look down and see that the users had made a candy trail leading from the front door into the offices with damaged equipment 
 i follow the trail into the first office 
 taped to the monitor is a picture of the user <unk> the monitor 
 i pull out my copy of the ticket and check the asset tag that is listed and sure enough the monitor was called in so i replace her monitor 
 i follow the trail further and the next office has a picture of the user <unk> on their pc 
 i take the hint and replace his pc 
 the last stop on the trail had a picture of the user <unk> his printer so it gets replaced 
 before i left i took a picture of me giving a cheesy grin and a thumbs up and taped them to each replacement 
 the next morning when i got to the shop and checked my e-mail i found that each user had send me a picture of them <unk> their new equipment 
 they really managed to <unk> up a long and annoying day 
 i just had an issue that i could n't resolve locally 
 it was for a printer that was n't printing 
 it worked fine from our test utility but would n't work from the user 's application 
 with issues like this we always escalate it to the company that hosts the application and they 'll do some magic on their end reset a bad address update a config etc to get it working again 
 usually it 's a 5 minute fix 
 so i emailed them the details of the issue the exchange was something like this : & gt me : hi we 're having issues with application not printing it works from our test utility but not from application so i imagine it just needs an address resetting on your end 
 & gt host : thanks for letting us know could you please give the location so we can send an engineer 
 i thought it was strange they 'd send an engineer for an issue like this they usually just reset it remotely 
 & gt me : location details 
 are you going to send out an engineer 
 usually you guys would just reset it remotely from your end 
 & gt them : i 've logged this as ticket reference and the engineer will be arriving soon 
 i figure whatever 
 it 's their application they know what they 're doing if they think they need an engineer on site then they probably do 
 i leave the issue while i wait to hear back from them 
 30 minutes later i get a call from my helpdesk : & gt hi <unk> we 've just logged a ticket for aforementioned issue from application host ... '' apparently i 'm the engineer they were going to send out to look into the issue that i just escalated to them 
 i do n't think this is going to end well 
 tldr : thanks for reporting the issue we 'll send you out to fix it <unk> did it support for two years before moving onto a software engineer role and i can say the level of incompetence was astounding but this was by far the best story i have 
 one day me and my fellow it team were <unk> in our office waiting for the day to be over when our manager gets a phone call 
 our boss fuming over how someone stole his hdd generally we never get a call from the boss so we all take this very seriously 
 me and my manager along with another tech leave to check out the situation 
 upon entering the office we find our boss using his computer i 'm a bit hesitant so i let my manager do the talking 
 he asks what computer had the hdd stolen as it obviously could n't be the one he 's using but our boss was adamant it was 
 he asks us to come look at the computer and points to a hole on the tower an empty bay where a cd-rom should be and starts fuming about how his hdd is completely gone 
 i get red in the face and the other tech is pointing at the obviously working computer 
 our manager explains what he 's missing and how his computer does in fact have a hdd the boss is completely dumbfounded by this <unk> 
 he calmly sits back down and this is where he tries to save face states it was a test to see how responsive we were and how we could leave the office now 
 that 's when i knew it support that directly dealt with customers was n't for <unk> tfts long time reader first time poster 
 i used to manage desktops and do general troubleshooting at a university that had an aviation department ironically my actual degree not computer ... anything with an airport campus 
 i 'd make weekly trips to the airport to fix whatever might be broken set up new desktops figure out why their file server was n't working etc 
 these folks were definitely my favorites to help were rarely demanding would usually only call well after they 'd already covered all of the basic troubleshooting steps and were very <unk> <unk> when it came to computers sometimes a good thing and as you 're about to see sometimes a very bad thing so on one of these visits i was tasked with installing some software on one of the mechanic 's computers 
 when i got to their office they were n't there which was to be expected 
 unlocked their office and discovered their computer was awake and logged in 
 this was not to be expected our lockout policy put the computers to sleep and locked them after 15 minutes 
 sit down to figure out what was keeping it awake and imagine my surprise when i moved the mouse and found they had <unk> a hole in the desk and installed a small cessna clock in the desk as in a clock pulled from a cessna <unk> panel every time the minute hand moved the mouse registered it as movement and kept the computer awake 
 to quote the great <unk> <unk> : i 'm not even mad that 's amazing '' told my supervisor do n't know if anything was done i was too impressed to care 
 tl : dr cessna manufactures mechanical mouse <unk> was at a previous job : after years of people coming into my office to ask me if the server '' was down which of course would be followed by a game of 20 questions 
 keep in mind we had 400+ servers and <unk> little systems all over the place 
 i decided to have some fun with it 
 i found a <unk> dell desktop wrote the server '' on the side of it in <unk> and put it up against the wall behind my chair 
 for the next several months only with co-workers who i knew and knew that they knew my sense of humor whenever someone would come in and ask is the server down 
 i would respond by looking at the desktop on the floor and reply with looks good to me '' 
 one time one of the users said but it does n't have any cables connected to it 
 should n't there be cables '' 
 nope it 's wireless '' ok good '' 
 then walked out 
 turns out their issue was trying to connect to an external webpage with a broken link previous tuesday morning <unk> kick kick kick 
 * & gt me : hey defiant <unk> aren’t really meant to be kicked around here 
 & gt defiant : practice is this afternoon 
 defiant kept juggling his football bouncing it off his foot over an over again 
 & gt me : we’re in it though 
 just stop 
 you could hit something 
 & gt defiant : meh 
 fine 
 defiant reluctantly picked up the ball from the ground whilst i looked at the ticket queue 
 **new ticket** & gt *i need some help saving my documents 
 it keeps <unk> - headhr 
 perfect 
 i thought 
 ***** as defiant and i arrived at hr i saw head of hr’s face 
 she was beaming with delight at defiant 
 & gt headhr : look 
 my computer is just not saving 
 perhaps you can help me young man 
 head of hr <unk> at me as defiant sighed and walked up to the computer 
 & gt defiant : okay… click <unk> then save 
 <unk> 
 defiant was startled by an actual error 
 the error was a standard formatting error 
 & gt defiant : <unk> think for a sec 
 defiant got up out of his chair and started juggling his soccer ball again 
 i hadn’t realized he was still holding it 
 & gt me : you can’t kick that in here 
 & gt defiant : we’re not in it 
 this is hr 
 & gt headhr : what are you… head of hr seemed confused that defiant had stepped away from the computer and was now kicking a ball in her office 
 & gt defiant : it helps me think 
 don’t worry a few more kicks and i’ll be able to solve your error 
 & gt me : defiant put the ball down 
 get fixing 
 defiant stopped kicking and fell back down into head of hr’s chair with a <unk> 
 & gt defiant : okay 
 this is a standard formatting error right now when you’re saving it is throwing up errors because the standard data conversion the program or format it uses can not compute some of the building blocks you’ve used 
 if however we change the format to another class it should be able to recognize all the <unk> and blocks 
 head of hr stood slightly stunned next to me 
 eventually she whispered to me slightly loudly 
 & gt headhr : i know what it does i messed with it so he’d have a job to do 
 <unk> he being so… i wasn’t sure if defiant could hear but he was looking at head of hr with a cold stare as she whispered 
 headhr obviously lost her <unk> mid sentence because she continued however speaking normally 
 & gt headhr : very good young man 
 how would you like a day in hr 
 & gt defiant : can i play football here 
 defiant looked <unk> at the football on the ground head of hr looked perplexed 
 & gt headhr : we generally do work here in hr… & gt defiant : no thank you then 
 head of hr looked a mixture of annoyed and dismayed 
 defiant had got up and continued kicking his ball 
 & gt headhr : could you <unk> that 
 the kicking is a bit annoying 
 defiant shrugged 
 he kept kicking 
 i’m not sure what exactly happened next but head of hr walked around her desk 
 she then made a swift kick at the ball connecting with it beautifully 
 the ball <unk> over her desk and would have gone straight out the door if i wasn’t directly in the way 
 <unk> & gt defiant : awww <unk> <unk> & gt headhr : oh my goodness 
 i’m so sorry 
 my face hurt 
 luckily after seeing such a good kick defiant seemed to want to stay in hr for the rest of the day 
 so.. that was good 
 i guess 
 ***** getting back to it my head very red and <unk> 
 i was jumped by redcheer 
 & gt redcheer : hey airz small problem ... next previous monday morning i felt refreshed after a whole weekend off 
 the office looked less depressing after a good sleep 
 i did however feel that something was missing from the office 
 it then dawned on me that defiant wasn’t coming in anymore 
 me : ahhh darn it 
 i decided the best way to get over it was to throw myself into tickets 
 & gt **new email** - <unk> finally confirmed it 
 mac has been hacked 
 you need to disable all macs from the network 
 * <unk> a helpful email attachment was included a word document inside which contained a single hyperlink to a news website announcing the confirmation of the first mac malware 
 as soon as i’d read the article my phone started to ring 
 & gt me : hello 
 & gt headsec : airz you’re in already 
 good 
 have you checked your email 
 & gt me : yeah 
 actually next time you want to link something just post the address in the email 
 don’t attach a word document with the link inside 
 headsec didn’t sound like he was listening through the phone 
 & gt headsec : you got ta disable the macs man 
 they’ve been hacked 
 & gt me : we’ve known about that vulnerable for a while it made world news how are you only hearing about this now 
 & gt headsec : are you <unk> the macs 
 & gt me : no 
 my simple statement send headsec into overdrive 
 & gt headsec : but they’re vulnerable 
 & gt me : we’ve known about the problem for a while luckily we’ve been spared infection 
 & gt headsec : we can’t risk it 
 i sighed first thing monday morning and someone already wants to disable an entire segment of our users machines 
 & gt me : just calm down 
 if we’re infected applications stop working 
 it even says so in your article 
 & gt headsec : no no 
 wait 
 i’ll get the vp on the line 
 he’ll sort this out 
 the head of security proceeded to conference call the vp 
 & gt headsec : vp the mac’s are infected 
 did you read the article i emailed you 
 & gt me : they aren’t infected 
 we’ve known about this bug for a while 
 the vp was slow to respond 
 it sounded like he was chatting to someone else in the background 
 i thought i heard giggling 
 must have been my <unk> 
 & gt vp : mmmm yes 
 i’ve read the article 
 i think i saw it on the news a while ago 
 & gt headsec : we should disable all mac’s 
 & gt me : we’re not infected 
 so 
 no 
 & gt headsec : <unk> hired as the security expert 
 the secure thing to do is disable all the mac’s 
 the vp took a while to respond this time he sounded like he was deciding 
 & gt vp : we’re not infected 
 & gt me : no 
 & gt vp : but we could be 
 & gt headsec : yep 
 the vp paused for a second 
 & gt vp : well the answer is obvious then… 
 another pause this time for even longer 
 & gt vp : pda’s can’t get infected 
 … 
 f $ # @ me 
 next <unk> to work that day i knew there was to be plenty bad noise 
 despite this feeling of ensuing doom it was an oddly <unk> kind of day 
 the morning sun was <unk> as it accompanied the first warm day of the year and seemed to fill the office with naturally warming <unk> light 
 news of our remarkable failure <unk> around the office as eyes <unk> my path from the lobby to my desk 
 as my outlook churned into gear it presented several new emails to look at i was only waiting for one 
 the ominous calendar entry from our <unk> sales director was present as expected decorated with the <unk> flag 
 i spent the morning <unk> through my tickets though i really had no intention of doing any of them 
 angie appeared around her usual 10am 
 her pace was rushed and the lack of her signatory starbucks cup <unk> angie’s obvious <unk> 
 <unk> to explain what happened yesterday ” her condescending vocal tone was different this time 
 before harsh and <unk> like a <unk> strict teacher a faint <unk> existed somewhere in the background 
 “i don’t know ” i responded 
 for once i seemed to be in the power position 
 “i do n't feel i was involved in this project ” she pressed for further information her voice taking on her signatory snarl and <unk> 
 hr tank accompanied by an anonymous administrative orderly unexpectedly appeared to relieve me of this <unk> 
 she demanded the immediate presence of the entire its department in the nearest meeting room 
 again our walking pace to the meeting room seemed <unk> slow a <unk> to hr <unk> slow purposeful walk 
 i stood in the corner of the room only finally noticing the distinct lack of bhit 
 hr tank began to speak through her <unk> face <unk> from her trip 
 her drained voice read her palpably <unk> and <unk> statement from a sheet which seemed to also serve as a barrier of <unk> 
 “it has been decided ” she began “that due to <unk> that have <unk> in the department of late that bhit is no longer able to <unk> his duty as head of it he will therefore not be returning to the business ” her statement droned on with all the <unk> you would expect from such a legally exacting statement 
 her statement ended with “i am authorized to answer any questions at this <unk> 
 the its team shuffled out dazed and wounded 
 for his <unk> bhit had evidently had all our backs somewhere along the line 
 we took our seats like a pack of wounded animals returning from some failed hunt 
 angie remained with hr tank discussing an imminent starbucks trip as roland stood guard in her absence 
 we all sat still and silent in one way to mark the <unk> of bhit and in the other we felt that the slightest motion would be recorded and later used against us as evidence 
 the fact that bhit had evidently taken the fall for the whole thing just seemed <unk> 
 angie’s consistent <unk> and hateful nature just seemed to be the only outlook we were <unk> that she had apparently won 
 the <unk> meeting time came up 
 as angie roland and i made our way to the top floor in the elevator the air grew thick with <unk> 
 the silence bellowed like a thousand years of social indifference as if the slightest word could <unk> the situation like a <unk> bomb 
 it seemed like ages until the lift doors finally opened 
 angie and roland <unk> <unk> out of the lift though i had yielded to them anyway 
 this was my first time in front of an official board 
 the room layout had changed 
 the sales and marketing managers sat in a row along the centre line of the arranged desk <unk> by the conspicuous presence of hr tank and another woman who it seemed was there to take notes 
 <unk> the <unk> was a man whose <unk> <unk> exuded the confidence and exterior meant he was someone of importance 
 angie roland and i took up position in front of this <unk> of vips 
 our plastic chairs clanged and <unk> bent into form to exemplify their <unk> an extreme contrast to the <unk> <unk> claimed by the panel 
 the central character who it soon became apparent was the division manager opened with a speech akin to that of some great <unk> 
 his <unk> of the utter failure intensified as his voice raised in volume yet remained controlled and collected 
 it was like he needed to say everything he needed to say like some <unk> tactic 
 the panel would interview us one at a time 
 i remained sat outside the office with roland as angie <unk> her case as its manager 
 memories of sitting outside the school <unk> office at school seemed came flooding back 
 though i had never really been a bad kid i found myself <unk> up outside the <unk> office a few times - a <unk> <unk> clad in black whose <unk> was intended solely to scare straight 
 roland sat with a smirk apparently unconcerned with these <unk> 
 his motionless gaze made me think that this guy had far more experience explaining himself to school principals than me 
 roland was up next 
 angie sat in the seat roland vacated 
 her arrogant indifference mirrored roland’s posture with eerie <unk> 
 i began to grow worried angie was always one step ahead of any game currently in progress 
 thoughts of explaining my job loss to my other half thoughts of having to <unk> made me nervous 
 after an hour of waiting patiently my time was finally up 
 i sat central to the panel trying to remember every interview technique that had ever been drilled into me by any chance i’d previously had to take such advice on board 
 i made sure to look at the person who was addressing me back straight shoulders back 
 here we go 
 the panel had their tactics down 
 it seemed no one person would ask more than one question at a time 
 the questions came slow <unk> calm and collected 
 the lady on the end of the panel appeared to note everything i said as the panel would wait for her silent ok to continue 
 at this moment i was ready to hang angie and her bastard <unk> out to dry 
 i just waited for my chance 
 after the initial questions largely surrounding who planned what the director placed his pen in front of him 
 he placed his <unk> on the table as he leaned his hardened chin on his first and second fingers mirrored and extended to provide support 
 as he leaned in he said <unk> us in your own words you account of what <unk> 
 i relayed my entire saga from angie’s <unk> of the project plan roland’s <unk> to being responsible for the images our <unk> and hapless manner of <unk> laptops instead delivering at the conference – all of it 
 i finished almost spitting out my words exercising this demon called angie 
 one of the sales managers enquired “why didn’t you check anything before you built them ” i defended “there was no time to do that 
 they had been built and <unk> by roland who apparently knew what he was doing 
 we had 200 machines to build and no means to verify anything ” i couldn’t tell if i had impressed with my answer or not 
 the thick silence felt like a poorly performing job interview 
 “why did you believe roland fully equipped to manage this implementation ” the <unk> of their questioning became stronger 
 “i didn’t ” responding inadvertently with a tone similar to angie’s <unk> and <unk> sneer 
 “i followed the direction of my management 
 i was told to leave him alone i did ” the md passed me a copy of my rollout plan 
 <unk> this the rollout plan you followed ” i picked it up <unk> through the already familiar pages i had spent several days <unk> <unk> before my final presentation 
 i looked up and said “no 
 angie altered the specification several times 
 the final version was signed off i believe by everyone here ” i felt like i had delivered a blow to everyone in the room who could even slightly have been <unk> for me as if i’d had twisted the knife in the very same way angie had done to <unk> her way to the top 
 after 30 minutes of <unk> i left the room 
 angie and roland had long vacated leaving the empty seats their emptiness like some <unk> <unk> prize 
 hr tank had concluded the meeting thanking me for my time ordering me back to my duties 
 its was silent for the <unk> of the day <unk> against the now brilliant <unk> sun obviously out of place in <unk> spring but seemed to invite action and good times <unk> against our <unk> mood 
 angie and roland were <unk> silent against the <unk> blur and shuffle of the its <unk> as they adjusted their postures to comfort 
 the only reprieve came from angie’s regular group <unk> her to their second of their starbucks trips this time joined by roland 
 the escape of my 4pm leaving time couldn’t have come quickly enough i made for home wondering if i would ever set foot in its again 
 the crystal clear night sky gave birth to another sunny day 
 the grime and dirt that <unk> my car seemed to <unk> for a good washing and detailing session 
 it was <unk> to have at least one thing on my list to occupy my time on the end of a <unk> queue 
 as i approached the car park <unk> of the pharmaceutical giant i wondered if security would deny access to their <unk> 
 i <unk> <unk> the gate in some <unk> attempt to exact my <unk> to dance on angie’s decrepit corpse 
 15 months of this woman was too much for anyone to deal with 
 as i <unk> <unk> the giant lobby stairs towards its i expected to be bundled to the floor at any moment by all manner of <unk> security guards to the approving look of angie 
 i was convinced this woman was far too <unk> to be <unk> by anything 
 almost <unk> its remained <unk> in its usual <unk> spot 
 my windows login worked as i began to prepare for the <unk> work 
 i arrived back from lunch with several members of third line and our previously borrowed helpdesk guy still <unk> his wounds from the onslaught of sales reps. qbg met us on our way down 
 she smiled <unk> excitedly yet softly declaring angie’s packing her desk 
 she’s history ” i didn’t believe her 
 i had to see this with my own eyes 
 i sat down maintaining as <unk> an outlook as i could pretending not to notice as angie wrapped her <unk> neck in the familiar black and grey shawl 
 roland’s desk surprisingly also lay vacated 
 angie <unk> the looks from its as she picked up her leather <unk> bag and made for the exit 
 “is she gone 
 was she fired ” a <unk> of questions <unk> our <unk> team 
 as we excitedly theorized and <unk> we eventually realized that there were only questions - no answers 
 this <unk> turn of events did nothing to <unk> my own fears 
 i tied myself to my desk waiting for someone – anyone – to order me into a closed doors meeting 
 but nobody came that <unk> nor the <unk> **previous** pt1 : a new world order pt2 : safety first pt3 : the it induction from hell pt4 : undercurrents pt5 : how to make friends and ... pt6 : marking territories pt7 : one friday to rue them all pt8 : best laid plans pt9 : its one step for man pt10 : ... and one step back for its pt11 : bring home the solider pt12 : who needs minor victories ... pt13 : dawn of a new nightmare pt14 : rules of engagement pt15 : bring out your dead pt16 : the greatest trick the devil ever pulled ... pt17 : who 's the king 
 pt18 : now that 's what i call a sticky situation pt19 : throw the dice pt20 : cardboard city pt21 : the rollout from hell years ago 
 this was just another day taking escalation calls from frontline at my telco when i got an amusing call 
 & gt bytewave : senior line bytewave you may send me your ticket '' 
 & gt subcontractor : sent 
 this is a military emergency camp nathan smith in afghanistan has lost <unk> with cfb <unk> 
 something is wrong with the satellites i do n't know what to do - but it 's major trouble '' 
 ... & gt bytewave : okay first we 're not providing support for any satellites 
 we have no control over what goes through satellites 
 it 's just ultimately routed through us 
 entry point for this there is our node network <unk> bravo dash <unk> did you check that node '' 
 & gt subcontractor : uhh but.. our soldiers in afghanistan can not connect to the biggest military base in the country 
 that 's like a national security sized satellite issue you have to call internal security to escalate 
 people could die just because they do n't have that link '' 
 & gt bytewave : yes it 's <unk> to have a network failure affecting a combat zone - which is why we need to keep our cool and determine where comms failed 
 did you look at the network tickets for the entry node '' 
 & gt subcontractor : what 
 soldiers lives are at risk 
 you have to call is now '' 
 *sigh* & gt bytewave : the satellites are working fine 
 as you could see by looking at the node 's tickets there 's currently a outage in <unk> due to a <unk> power failure in the area 
 the storm there damaged some equipment the <unk> <unk> relies upon 
 the link is n't working because cfb <unk> has no power 
 all our equipment is green as you could have seen if you used your tools '' 
 & gt subcontractor : but ... <unk> ... & gt bytewave : happy to be of assistance anything else i can help you with '' 
 ... of course not 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 so i 'm an intern for a fairly large organization and part of my day to day job is to help users with general work orders 
 normally i deal with file share requests providing access to certain applications or general it related questions 
 it 's rare but occasionally i need to provide access to servers 
 and this is where our tale begins ... $ me : me $ hu : <unk> user $ me : & gt tech support this is taco how can i help you today 
 $ hu : & gt i need server access 
 $ me : & gt could i get the name of the server and your account information 
 $ hu : <unk> <unk> $ me : & gt for the changes to go into effect on your account you 'll need to do a quick <unk> 
 i 'll stay on the line with you while you do this 
 $ hu : <unk> due to <unk> -- -- - a few moments later -- -- - $ hu : & gt okay i 'm going to try and log into the server now ... $ me : & gt that 's fine i 'll stay here <unk> you have any problems 
 -- -- - a few more grumbles and moments later -- -- - $ hu : & gt my account ca n't log in i thought you said you gave me access 
 $ me : & gt sometimes when logging in you need to specify the domain 
 under username '' try typing in <unk> '' $ hu : & gt fine ... i do n't get why this needs to be this complicated 
 -- -- <unk> grumbling and a few more minutes -- - $ hu : & gt i still ca n't get in 
 $ me : & gt are you getting any error messages 
 $ hu : & gt i did n't read it 
 ca n't you just remote in and help 
 $ me : & gt sure no problem 
 within seconds of remoting in i see the problem 
 username : <unk> password : <unk> the man did n't actually enter his id number he literally typed <unk> '' 
 needless to say he was embarrassed and i was left with an amusing <unk> this conversation happened the other day : & gt mom : why when $ friend sends me a text message i do n't get it on my phone 
 me : what do you mean 
 mom : i do n't know any other way to say it she sent a message and i did n't get it 
 me : so she told you she sent a message 
 but you never got the message she said she sent 
 mom : nope 
 i never got it 
 me : do you think maybe she did n't send it 
 mom : i can get message from $ <unk> but not $ friend me : do both of these people have iphones 
 mom : yeah 
 me : then you should have gotten any message that sent 
 it 's unlikely that <unk> was turned off 
 mom : it was 
 i had to turn it back on 
 why did it get turned off 
 did you touch my phone 
 me : i 'm only here once a week and i never touched your phone 
 mom : then how did it get turned off 
 me : you probably did it by accident 
 mom : no 
 i would n't have turned that off 
 me : that 's why i said accident 
 mom : no son i know what i 'm doing 
 me : then why was your imessages turned off 
 who played with your phone 
 mom : scoffing no one 
 i 'm the only one who <unk> my phone 
 me : so you probably <unk> turned off imessages and this prevents messages from coming in sometimes because the other iphone that is sending the message does n't know to send it <unk> instead 
 mom : i did n't turn off imessages son 
 me : then your fucking phone is haunted 
 <unk> not exactly tech-support but i know we 've all been down this road with someone we know 
 i 'm sitting at home in my <unk> waiting to get ready for work when the home phone rings 
 it 's my grandma 
 me : hey gram 
 how are you 
 her : honey the tv is n't working 
 oh good ... one of <unk> calls me : ok did you press the big red power button 
 her : yes but it 's not working me : ok did you take the batteries out of the remote again 
 her : <unk> noises* no they 're still in there me : ok what are the letters on the bottom of the remote there should be big white letters under all the buttons her : <unk> i instantly knew the problem me : ok gram what are the letters printer under the screen of the tv 
 her : <unk> me : ok so that remote does n't go with your tv 
 throw it away 
 you have n't had a <unk> tv in over 10 years her : what if i need the remote later 
 me : <unk> throw it away 
 you do n't need it 
 i promise **edit** my first gold 
 thanks everyone 
 my grandma is pushing <unk> of age so these calls do n't bother me in the slightest 
 i mostly laugh at them previous as i looked down at the mile of <unk> tickets getting older by the second i decided i needed the week off from this place 
 i gathered the four best working techs into my office to explain how we as a team where going to solve this problem 
 solitaire color-blind hockey where all assembled in the office with various states of nervousness 
 & gt me : okay who doesn’t know whats going on 
 no one answered 
 it seemed the news of the tickets <unk> up in a silent account was already spread before solitaire worked up the bravery to come see me 
 & gt me : we’re going to get through all these tickets in record time 
 & gt colorblind looked up at me 
 he wasn’t happy 
 & gt c/b : sorry i can’t help 
 i got ta go audit every computer in the <unk> clean out ever <unk> colourblind waited for a response 
 & gt me : oh yes 
 those tickets will now be taken out of your account 
 & gt c/b : thank you but i still don’t see why we should race to <unk> <unk> just fire him now and we can spend a week or two fixing this 
 i looked over at my coffee 
 it said you ca n't fire someone for helping out another employee 
 which is what the ghost account started off as 
 even if it did backfire in everyone’s face 
 & gt me : oh good plan 
 solitaire gave me a worried look 
 & gt me : and i suppose you’re going to take over teaching itsec everything he needs to know 
 & gt c/b : we could just fire him too 
 right 
 & gt me : while i 'm at it since i’m firing two people <unk> i should really fire everyone who potentially messed with the competition and the ticket server in any way 
 perhaps the increased load from a script checking the queue every <unk> seconds contributed in some way to the problem 
 & gt c/b : oh… a knock at the door drew my attention 
 a secretary with her hair in a twist walked into the office 
 & gt twist : the vp wants to see you in his office… now 
 & gt me : he could have called 
 & gt twist : the it systems seem to be breaking the vp didn’t want the phone lines to also potentially mess up the message 
 we got ta <unk> everything now 
 so till its all <unk> we’re walking the important messages 
 & gt me : whaaaa 
 its only the ticketing <unk> 
 never mind 
 coffee screamed at me to stay on task 
 i turned back to the techs assembled in my office 
 & gt me : okay team listen do your best pump out those tickets 
 good luck 
 time to see the vp 
 fun 
 next a month had passed since mafg 's passing 
 morale was at a low point and apart from angie 's <unk> temper things seemed to <unk> along as they were each day <unk> to be more and more difficult to get through 
 the it cupboard slowly <unk> its isolation as angie seemed to track our movements with animal-like instinct imposing ridiculous policy after policy 
 the battery <unk> on mafg 's mouse had at some point faded to nothingness having spent its remaining <unk> <unk> <unk> its <unk> <unk> 
 mafg sacrifice was guarded in its reasoning 
 many theorized the lost machines from the meeting room had made it to his car some theorized he’d <unk> some director in a <unk> moment of sincerity there was even a rumour he had put angie in her place in some <unk> fit of <unk> <unk> in the flabbergasted stares of twenty faceless <unk> 
 the reality was far more boring and told to me over a weekend pint of fine <unk> 
 mafg’s wife had previously worked with the company in their research division 
 she had left under <unk> circumstances for a competing pharmaceutical company 
 management felt that mafg’s continued employment was <unk> and had compelled him to take a <unk> agreement to end his tenure 
 it seemed odd that mafg’s wife had left the company over six months ago we felt that this discrepancy <unk> of angie’s involvement 
 for a while though a specific date had shone brightly in my outlook calendar 
 it had acted as a target representing a reprieve from the mundane <unk> support had to offer 
 i had prepared for it arrival with <unk> 
 it finally arrived and my audience with several heads of <unk> bhit and the software vendor was mine to shine in 
 the purpose was to set into motion the plans for their <unk> laptop rollout 
 armed with my carefully crafted <unk> dutifully outlined on several <unk> i set off for the meeting three floors up in the <unk> part of the building 
 in my mind i was <unk> the great <unk> raised in hand off to <unk> in what seemed to be an inevitable <unk> conclusion 
 ok i don’t know much about history but all i knew was my <unk> was huge and i was about to go kick some ass 
 my arrival at the meeting was met with the usual pleasantries and shaking of hands 
 the meeting room was perfectly air <unk> with several pieces of <unk> standing <unk> in large <unk> plant <unk> 
 the large window welcomed the sun in vast <unk> into the <unk> room 
 underneath the heated <unk> of light was the ominous shape of angie sat at the far end of the room away from all human contact 
 the sunlight seemed to <unk> and blur angie 's <unk> like some <unk> aura but her bent bitter frame was just too familiar and imposing to ignore 
 the meeting began with the usual round of <unk> identification 
 angie’s <unk> introduction was only suffixed by the words i am in charge of support '' 
 her <unk> made an instant impression on everyone as they hastily moved on 
 the software vendor rep was a techy through and through 
 he stood for his presentation <unk> in what was obviously a brand new suit purchased for the occasion 
 it seemed to <unk> him as he awkwardly passed around his company <unk> <unk> pens cards product <unk> there were logos on everything as if he was clearly instructed to embark on this <unk> but try to hide his obvious <unk> 
 my segment came 
 i eagerly handed out my carefully crafted mission statement adorned with pie charts <unk> charts and technical <unk> made just basic enough to <unk> even the most <unk> of sales managers 
 i explained my <unk> with a <unk> speech which lasted several minutes : <unk> new laptops and <unk> to remain in the field 
 across three hardware types several primary <unk> were to be used for pilot testing each user would receive an extra <unk> on home drives and be responsible for their own backups each rep 's laptop would be first imaged for any later data retrieval and each rep would be <unk> by the end of the day 
 angie 's eyes remained focused on me throughout the session 
 i felt odd as she had n't interjected once 
 our vendor 's rep nodded in anticipation as rep after rep smiled in anticipation 
 they liked what they heard : new toys for everyone and all they had to do was give the all ok 
 my moment of triumph at an end angie finally spoke up 
 what sort of <unk> do we need for this '' 
 her voice was rather different she spoke as if i were part of her menopause club all <unk> had dissipated into a <unk> vocal tone 
 i retorted putting aside my stunned silence that i expected to prepare the images myself and builds would be used to train up some more junior members of staff in the absence of mafg 
 she nodded in approval as she made notes 
 her lack of typical <unk> anger <unk> me 
 nevertheless the meeting ended in what appeared to be a <unk> sense of <unk> as the balding head of it smiled proudly sharing all manner of <unk> with his <unk> as the vendor techie and i exchanged pleasantries angie left anonymous in her wake without saying another word 
 i knew this move by now 
 her silent departure was signatory of her <unk> she was up to something 
 it distracted me momentarily as i asked the vendor guy to repeat what he had just <unk> what was this devious <unk> up to 
 i was not left in suspense for long 
 that afternoon its were summoned to a meeting room where angie wanted to discuss the rollout 
 i knew angie was cooking something and i knew it was a clear move to usurp my <unk> laid plans 
 my only <unk> was that i had the backing of bhit and several <unk> what could she possibly do 
 our entrance into angie’s meeting was made strange by the <unk> presence of a spotty urchin who had previously been chained to helpdesk 
 his sharp eyes and pointed thin <unk> features seemed <unk> familiar his <unk> shirt and pale jeans seemed to be a desperate attempt to look normal 
 angie began the meeting by <unk> the urchin returning to her familiar <unk> vocal tone 
 “this is roland 
 he is joining 2nd line <unk> she <unk> as her eyes <unk> around the room as if to highlight her claim 
 the meeting continued with angie’s voice <unk> my exact words complete with <unk> one could only <unk> to someone whose obvious depth had <unk> been <unk> 
 i think at some point the only thing keeping us awake was angie’s voice shrill and bent in character 
 she had finally finished when i decided to speak 
 i knew my <unk> would further madden the beast mainly as it would actually be of technical relevance and accuracy which angie could never possibly dream of 
 but i had to <unk> my role in this project 
 <unk> have the majority of the machines built prior to the event so most will only need booting up and profiles loading 
 there will also be a ghost server file server and we’ll have a connection back to the office 
 all <unk> laptops will be backed up later back at the office any laptops that are staying out will have to be backed up and loaded at the event in one hit 
 we’ll also keep ten spare new laptops just in case anything <unk> the its crew hung on every word as if i were <unk> a life or death situation 
 angie fired corrections in as much as she could though mired in technical incompetence 
 “you will have to back up everything you get ” her accusatory vocal sneer <unk> that we may do anything different 
 we had a mission we had our tasks i had a rollout to deliver 
 it was getting towards the end of the day 
 roland had picked his spot next to me taking mafg’s spot 
 he was not <unk> he barely acknowledged <unk> presence 
 a few <unk> <unk> intended to <unk> him into our team didn’t get so much as a raised <unk> 
 his body language was eerie in its familiarity 
 brandishing my purchase order signed by bhit and bearing sales & amp <unk> stamp approving the project with every <unk> that one could ever hope to see on such a document i headed to the elevators to scale the <unk> to the procurement department 
 i was joined in the elevator by qbg who seemed eager to have a word 
 it seemed qbg had some sort of big secret she would have burst if she hadn’t let out 
 <unk> 
 you know who he is don’t you ” qbg spoke softly as if the lift were <unk> with some manner of <unk> equipment 
 “that’s angie’s son ” her words were difficult to <unk> but roland’s mannerisms posture familiar <unk> it all rang out clear as a bell 
 the thought of this woman <unk> seemed unnatural 
 it <unk> images of some monstrous <unk> act between a <unk> <unk> and some hapless male <unk> <unk> in her web held prisoner for his seed 
 but it all seemed too obvious now 
 like a slow <unk> car accident everything started to make sense 
 there had to be someone who had shown angie how to access touchpaper she was clearly still struggling with it a month on 
 someone had to show angie how to use the printers 
 someone had to have fed back to angie anything and everything we’d complained about her 
 someone had to have kept angie informed of our whereabouts – how else could she track us with such animal-like accuracy 
 there he was - in the background the whole time as enigmatic and as <unk> as the bitch that <unk> him 
 that same spotty 1st <unk> who angie demanded i cleared down the it cupboard with so long ago the <unk> shadow which seemed to appear every so often as if every photographic memory which flashed into view had his image <unk> somewhere on it… standing by a printer walking through the its area sitting nearby in the <unk> her spy invisible to the naked eye 
 as incredible as it seemed there it was… our <unk> exposed far too late to be in any way <unk> he was now closer than we could have ever <unk> 
 we had allowed him to creep up on us like a <unk> - angie’s inside man

 one day minutes before closing time a middle aged man came in saying that he was having volume problems 
 i ask him what problem he has and says let me show you 
 he pulls out his laptop and starts it 
 of course it takes 5 minutes to boot up so as it is doing that i ask him what problem he is having 
 he tells me that the volume on youtube is n't working 
 i ask him if he is able to hear audio from other things on his computer 
 music other websites etc 
 he says everything else is working 
 so i tell him that if all sources of audio are working except for youtube then the first thing i would assume is that youtube is simply muted 
 the man is insulted as if i am calling him a monkey 
 i was merely thinking aloud but that was all i could immediately think of 
 the manager walked by and the man started saying that i was being arrogant and insulting to him 
 he says that this is why he never comes here ... despite being here now 
 so his computer is on i pick a youtube video of <unk> 's believe as that is my go to sample video 
 no volume 
 i tell him yeah the volume is off 
 he then points at how the x to represent mute is not there 
 i tell him yeah it is n't muted you just have the volume all the way down 
 he appears visibly embarrassed which was fine i just wanted to go home 
 he then proceeds to pack up quickly and leave without saying thank you 
 man what a vacation 
 america is weird but i like it 
 thanks <unk> you 're my favourite 
 <unk> 
 thanks <unk> for the drinks and hangs 
 -- back at the infamous datacentre from hell i formed good <unk> with a few of the <unk> customers 
 they 'd ask for <unk> every now and then and i 'd help out where i could 
 sometimes this ended well for me contract work on the side other times it did n't helping out people who were either too smart for their own good or too dumb for life 
 this is ... i do n't know 
 somewhere in the middle 
 one of these customers had a couple of odd requests over the course of maybe a month 
 1. buy a roll of <unk> cable and 8 <unk> of it from his rack out to the plant room 
 2. take delivery of a box of <unk> pci cards i 've never seen before and leave them in the rack 
 wat '' sure whatever tony 
 i guess some other stuff happened while i was away or he got someone else in to do some things because a few months later he had an incredibly bizarre request 
 i did n't know it yet but all these requests were linked 
 & gt tony : 'i need you to go across the street to the <unk> and buy me all the vodafone sim cards they have now i got ta say at this point i was confused 
 goddamn confused 
 this got no better when the next set of instructions came through a bit later 
 & gt tony : <unk> out every pci card in the servers and take the old sim cards out then put the new ones in afterwards he explained what was going on 
 see when vodafone was hitting the market hard for prepaid phones in australia they did something pretty stupid 
 there was a $ 200 recharge that would give you $ 1200 of credit the only catch was that it had a 30 day <unk> 
 who would do such a thing 
 what person needs $ 1200 a month of phone credit but ca n't get on a plan 
 someone who was terminating skype 's voip calls in australia onto the mobile <unk> network 
 yeah 
 i know 
 by taking advantage of the ridiculous call value he was able to generate cell calls at a <unk> of the cost of a <unk> 
 in fact what he 'd done while i was away was to install 8 massive <unk> on the end of the cable and hang them out the window of the building 
 he 'd generated so many calls that he crashed the local cell tower 
 then crashed it again 
 <unk> repeat until vodafone upped the bandwidth to the site and finally could begin investigating how one small area could be <unk> the mobile phone network so much it was breaking it 
 it was then that they started realising this huge volume of calls was coming from very specific sims so they did what any carrier would do - cut them off 
 upon doing this his response was to just <unk> more sim <unk> 
 so they were replaced 
 and thus began an endless game of cat & amp mouse as he varied the call timing allowed out on the channels to <unk> them to look <unk> as <unk> kept blocking his sims 
 this continued until it became <unk> by which stage he 'd made so much money from it he had the capital to <unk> more pops and move the calls around to different towers and became effectively untraceable 
 well played tony 
 well played 
 -- stay tuned to /r/chhopsky for more <unk> and fun that are n't appropriate for tfts its had a full compliment of staff the following morning 
 there was work to do - but nothing seemed important enough to leave desks for 
 we were all were gathered for one purpose 
 one of our soldiers was in trouble 
 though we were powerless to do anything other than offer moral support we felt glued to our desks 
 angie was palpably absent her familiar black and grey shawl being the only spectral reminder of her presence somewhere in the building 
 mafg was quiet assurances of help to find other work and <unk> <unk> came and went like <unk> of water 
 soon angie and hr tank arrived at mafg 's deskside 
 the scene brief as it was seemed as if they had taken him into custody short of only <unk> 
 they led him to angie 's special place of <unk> situated somewhere far beyond the familiar dimly corridor just barely visible from its 
 a bulb had gone in that corridor some time ago it just seemed that nobody had ever replaced it 
 i had seen angie lead a few people down this corridor when they had hit the height of her displeasure 
 today though they moved artificially slowly 
 mafgs <unk> moved uncomfortably as if to not let on their progress was <unk> by hr tank 's inability to keep up with normal walking pace - a walk that angie had seemed to perfect 
 as the figures shuffled around the corner at the end of the corridor the dim lighting served as a <unk> <unk> of some mysterious doom the shadow of angie 's tall thin figure <unk> on the <unk> walls like some <unk> ghost 
 a few minutes of disbelief followed in its 
 the team stared at various spots on the floor of our square work area trying to explain things in our own minds not even a breath was audible 
 this two minutes silence was terminated only as mafg 's monitor <unk> entered their sleep <unk> and faded to black 
 as quickly as the images faded so did any sense of hope or morale we barely <unk> onto and so did our moment of <unk> 
 we promptly turned to our own desks to work 
 angie and mafg returned two quick hours later 
 accompanied by two security guards they stood <unk> to angie 's familiar sharp <unk> leadership of the situation 
 hr tank was nowhere around i could only presume that her weight <unk> her making the return journey 
 mafg added personal items from his desk to a small cardboard box his lips dry from lack of <unk> his throat obviously lumpy 
 angie 's stern face stood <unk> 
 the silence in its was broken only with angie 's <unk> 
 where is your usb disk you ca n't take that '' she barked mafg coiled the usb cable around his <unk> well taken care of <unk> drive 
 she snatched it as he offered it to her her eyes still now showing even a grain of <unk> 
 we need your phone too '' 
 her growl seemed to <unk> mafg but he could n't react 
 his slow purposeful movements were fighting every urge to <unk> to the lump in his throat 
 mafg duly handed her his trusty blackberry refusing to make eye contact 
 it instantly brought back memories to me of when we had first been issued these phones 
 mafg and i had spent a good week exploring their potential loading on useful <unk> and configuring them for maximum it support <unk> 
 they had been the <unk> of a good <unk> friendship 
 it just seemed this memory was torn now <unk> on by this monster 
 angie took mafg 's blackberry and extended her arm in my direction clad in a heavy black <unk> sleeve as if to contrast so heavily with her pale skin 
 her <unk> hand ushered it in my direction 
 as i took it from her it felt like i was taking a gift from some devil 
 she said with a bitter tongue there now you have one '' 
 i sat stunned as mafg looked at both me and angie 
 the ordeal was nearly over - but not quite 
 mafg picked up his cardboard box of <unk> <unk> old pay slips and desk <unk> 
 he motioned his completion but angie again extended her hand to block his <unk> 
 <unk> into life one of the security guards broke from his uncomfortably <unk> stance and took the box from mafg 
 he placed it back on his desk 
 the guard started digging around in the box almost <unk> in his movements 
 his grey security shirt stretched over his <unk> arms as he bent over for his task 
 he removed several company branded pens and an unopened pack of mafg 's business cards 
 on their discovery each piece of contraband were cast onto the desk surface their respective <unk> and <unk> a soundtrack to whatever wrong-doing mafg had done to earn this punishment 
 after nodding towards angie and <unk> his arms the security guard took his rightful place next to his colleague both mustering as much energy as they could to maintain their stern postures 
 <unk> of sweat ran down the guard 's face he was not used to standing this much 
 the <unk> march shuffled away towards the main <unk> 
 the <unk> led by angie mafg carrying his own cardboard coffin and the duo of security guard <unk> seemed to have the attention of the entire floor 
 the only evidence of mafgs existence was now reduced to four pens a pack of business cards and the wireless mouse whose flashing red battery symbol echoed the loss of its user 
 the only noise was from finance <unk> ignorant of the situation as they loudly discussed their day-to-day

 we had a summer intern one summer documenting some of our processes 
 he tried to install something and needed an admin password so he asked me for help 
 & gt $ intern : hey can you install something for me 
 & gt $ me : no 
 he has what he needs to do his job so i have no reason to install anything on his computer 
 & gt $ in : you do n't even know what it is 
 & gt $ me : fine what is it 
 & gt $ in : $ <unk> 
 & gt $ me : what does it do 
 & gt $ in : it allows me to script mouse movements and keyboard <unk> 
 big red flag there 
 there is no way i 'm installing this on a work computer 
 i 'm shocked he even ask for such a thing 
 & gt $ me : no you do n't need that 
 & gt $ in : but this would make my work so much easier 
 i 've used it before so i know its safe 
 but are you safe 
 & gt $ me : what are you trying to do that would require this program 
 & gt $ in : i have this $ <unk> file open and i need to replace this specific text on all the tabs 
 & gt $ me : how does that require this software 
 & gt $ in : this takes long to save the file move to the next tab find the text and replace it 
 so i want to script the work 
 & gt $ me : that 's what the find and replace is for 
 & gt $ in : but that only searches on the current tab not all of them 
 & gt $ me : yes it does 
 & gt $ in : not it does n't 
 & gt $ me : yes it does 
 & gt $ in : not it does n't 
 & gt $ me : prove it press <unk> 
 he opens the find dialog 
 & gt $ me : you see that option there that says search in all tabs 
 & gt $ in : that was n't there before 
 & gt $ me : sure it was n't 
 i ca n't even ... this is not a tale where i perform many <unk> - i 'm mostly watching a friend tired of having to troubleshoot under the <unk> of circumstances at my telco 
 we 're now an item and i essentially promised a tale about her 
 it was many years ago 
 i had been promoted to senior staff - she had n't yet 
 we had terrible equipment back then 
 long resolved issue but back then it really bugged me after spending a couple years dealing with that 
 after my promotion i had a nice brand computer and three screens all was well 
 but underneath my <unk> a couple hundred frontline techs were still using <unk> and a single screen - for many of them it was a old crt - often kinda <unk> from back when you could <unk> <unk> when taking calls 
 our hardware was simply atrocious 
 i wanted to change that and <unk> my new position i was able to sit in a lower management meeting to pitch my point 
 & gt bytewave : the terrible and <unk> state of the current equipment means that most frontline on this floor has to reboot their computers <unk> everyday if we average 
 usually there 's a customer on hold sometimes they have an escalation dept on <unk> when their garbage fails - either way we 're bleeding money everytime 
 beyond chain delays nothing is uniform i could take any two stations on the lower floor and it 's basically lottery when it comes to hardware 
 based on the tickets to systems i came up with this graph of stats that demonstrate we really ought to use the emergency funds to fix this 
 we need a uniform and stable solution and it 'll save us tons in ... '' & gt lower management : there 's just no <unk> but we know it 's bad 
 maybe in a few quarters we can look at it but keep in mind tech support is an expense not a revenue 
 it 'll probably stay this way as long as it 's still working '' 
 ... someone was in the room as i was told it could n't happen 
 she 's now a colleague we 're closer than ever 
 called <unk> in my tales - back then she was rather new 
 as a very pretty young new thing on a technical support floor most of the guys were most interested in her looks rather than her mind 
 she proved them all wrong - the rest of this tale is n't about me 
 the next day she told me in the break room that i made a strong argument and thanked me for trying 
 her own clone and yellow crt monitor were probably some of the worst on the floor back then 
 but she did n't say yet she planned to do something about it 
 soon after as i 'm walking past her desk i see her installing unusual software 
 i ca n't recall the name but the thing <unk> your gpu to run some heavy <unk> regarding human <unk> 
 back then anyone could install whatever they wanted on their workstation it controls were minimal 
 she happened to have a decent video card in her otherwise terrible clone even though those ran very hot 
 i did n't immediately pick up on what she was doing 
 obviously pushing a gpu to it 's limits means quite a bit of heat 
 later that day looking down to the main floor i saw her <unk> by two suits and a union rep walking into a manager 's office 
 that union rep being one of my best friends i rapidly got a <unk> copy of the conversation - the union is pretty religious about writing down everything 
 ... & gt amelia : oh it 's no big deal but they told us in basic training to report any injuries no matter how light 
 something about insurance liabilities 
 i just burned my hand on the computer 
 there was something wrong with my mouse i tried to fix it but ... yeah i 'm a <unk> all i got to show for it is this burn '' 
 & gt <unk> : err it does n't look all that bad are you sure that it 's actually worth <unk> '' & gt hr : what the hell 
 we do n't <unk> injury claims 
 we need them all reported we already have a problem where too many employees fail to report minor injuries 
 insurance liabilities at <unk> '' 
 & gt union rep : right ... very important to be thorough about this ... indeed always report any injuries no matter how minor 
 let 's file the paperwork '' 
 & gt amelia : well if you want to put your hand near where i got the burn you 'll see how hot it is '' 
 knowing her probably some <unk> eyes involved somewhere always effective 
 they 're just too damn blue 
 soon after they decide to look at the offending computer 
 the hr rep puts his hand on her terrible clone which happens to have a <unk> card pumping everything it could thanks to the <unk> software running which ensured her gpu stayed north of <unk> 
 most of our <unk> simply used <unk> video but some had real video cards - it happens when you 're using random hardware everywhere 
 & gt hr with a warm hand : fuck 
 ouch what the hell 
 call in the <unk> health & amp safety board now '' 
 they did n't say anything else in front of that union rep or union employees but her trick was good 
 within three weeks *everything* was pulled out and replaced by nice-looking asus boxes and dell screens 
 the last of our <unk> were thrown out 
 hell i saw someone loading some of the trash into a truck from our garbage bin - i hope he had better luck with them than we did 
 that stuff was seriously outdated 
 since then no such issues - the telco sucks right and left but we no longer appear to consider that it 's worth it to cut corners when it comes to the hardware tech support needs 
 nowadays senior staff can often work from home using <unk> equipment they install at the telco 's expense if we ask for it

 <unk> : fixed links for some mobile <unk> previous as i sat in a chair coffee in one hand phone in the other i realised the next person i spoke to would solve my dilemma 
 i had been transferred over to notie’s father in law whilst calling his references 
 i took a sip of my coffee anticipation <unk> up inside 
 how well or badly this would go 
 even i didn’t know but what i did know was… if worst came to worst i could always hang up 
 i heard the phone pick up as i took a sip of coffee 
 a gruff voice spoke 
 & gt gruff : hello the line is <unk> 
 & gt me : wha.. oh sorry i was just <unk> never mind hello its airz here 
 & gt gruff : airz aye 
 what cha calling me 
 what cha calling me 
 i do n't even think that makes sense 
 coffee reminded me to just get on with it 
 & gt me : i just wanted to ask you about notie 
 gruff started coughing through the phone the instant he heard the name notie 
 & gt gruff : what about notie 
 & gt me : he used to work for you 
 as an it staff member ... & gt gruff : you think i don’t know what my own son in law did 
 i realised gruff was taking offense i took a <unk> of coffee and <unk> on 
 not hangup worthy yet 
 & gt me : just wondering how he was as a worker did he turn up on time 
 & gt gruff : you call me up 
 to ask me about my son in <unk> working skills 
 are you implying he wouldn’t turn up to work on time 
 & gt me : er… no 
 wait what 
 gruff started sounding angry 
 & gt gruff : you’re asking me if my own family is punctual of course he is he’s a proud notieian ** edit : he said noties last name ** i didn’t really understand what was going on 
 i was fairly sure notie and gruff didn’t even have the same last name 
 & gt me : sorry i think we’ve had a misunderstanding 
 we’re currently ringing up notie’s references he just interviewed with us for an it position 
 & gt gruff : i see 
 gruff sounded like he’d calmed down a bit 
 & gt me : so insights into his work you can share would be helpful 
 & gt gruff : well as you know he’s a notieian ** see edit above ** which means he’s a good worker 
 that 's your seal of quality you can take that to the bank 
 never had a day wrong with him 
 i picked up my coffee that was useful information to know 
 i took a sip 
 tasted like confusion 
 & gt me : sorry wait 
 what 
 he’s a great worker 
 & gt gruff : yes 
 & gt me : apologies but why would you fire your best worker 
 gruff paused for a moment on the other end of the line 
 he’d either had an <unk> or a stroke 
 & gt gruff : fire <unk> a bit strong a word i think… i didn’t know how to reply to that silence reigned for what seemed like forever 
 & gt gruff : i <unk> him to pursue other options 
 & gt me : okay 
 & gt gruff : listen airz… whats your last name 
 i seriously considered telling him but my hang up meter was pretty high 
 luckily he kept going without it 
 & gt gruff : notie he’s a good worker 
 however he took the best years of my daughters life and guess what… 
 no child 
 no one to carry on the notieian ** see edit above ** name 
 i’m pretty sure he can’t even have a kid 
 what do they call that 
 & gt me : ummm… i was tempted to hang up 
 instead i grabbed a pen and wrote <unk> ” next to the “angry ” i’d already written 
 & gt me : perhaps we should get back on <unk> what notie was like as an employee of your company 
 & gt gruff : he’s punctual he was an it tech here for 15 years never had a problem with him professionally 
 so.. & gt me : okay… thanks 
 i grabbed a pen again and as i hung up i wrote down <unk> '' 
 next to the other two words i’d already written 
 as looked down at my sheet i admired my handiwork of two phone calls 
 “angry ” <unk> ” <unk> next got a new hire a while ago 
 let 's call her $ noobcake 
 $ noobcake is your classic <unk> user '' 
 on $ noobcake 's first day i made a grand total of six trips to her office for various issues 
 i do n't like this mouse my monitor is too bright my monitor is too dim my wrists hurt from typing on this keyboard i do n't know how to check my email etc 
 she started on a friday so i have a nice <unk> weekend away from email and the ticket queue 
 monday morning i see several tickets from her in the queue 
 i open the first one 
 it was submitted on friday evening well after i went home 
 & gt * '' hi <unk> 
 i got an email from $ vendor telling me to sign in to $ application but it 's not letting me in 
 help 
 * that 's strange i think 
 my organization does have <unk> with $ vendor but her department does n't use $ application at all 
 i ask her to forward the email to me 
 i hang out in the break room for a few minutes <unk> into a <unk> cup of coffee 
 i wonder if i 'll be able to see my future in the steam 
 nope but i manage to fog up my glasses 
 my phone pings 
 new email from $ noobcake 
 i ignore it for now - it can wait until i 'm back at my desk 
 the main <unk> from <unk> hero '' starts <unk> out of nowhere 
 it takes me a moment to realize that it 's coming from my pocket 
 i recognize the phone number of <unk> cd from <unk> 
 the guy 's a real character 
 he 's two parts <unk> bear three parts terminator robot 
 we go way back - used to work for the same department 
 & gt me : hey baby talk to me 
 cd : stop calling me baby 
 do you have a user named $ noobcake 
 me : yeah she 's a new hire 
 what 's up 
 cd : apparently her account hit the exchange server over 400 times in the past hour 
 any idea what that 's all about 
 something clicks in my brain and everything makes sense all of a sudden 
 & gt me : i know what 's going on 
 lock out her account 
 i 'll deal with her when she comes in 
 i go back to my desk and pull up the forward from $ noobcake 
 yep all the classic signs are there - poor grammar threat of account <unk> generic <unk> address 
 i <unk> through the contents of my desk and grab a <unk> on web security and phishing 
 still half an hour before $ noobcake arrives 
 the coffee is finally cool enough to drink 
 it 's a thankless job but people like $ noobcake ensure that i 'll always be able to find employment 
 *tl dr - took <unk> and viagra before going on space mountain woke up as the <unk> <unk> of two <unk> android <unk> 
 lost my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> but at least my <unk> still tastes like <unk> 
 *note : the company’s weeks are sunday to sunday but it takes three days for them to <unk> that into actual payment 
 so pay day is… <unk> night 
 kinda irrelevant <unk> previous wednesday afternoon i sat in my office two coffees filled to the <unk> sitting on my desk 
 waiting 
 a knock at the door made me jump 
 redcheer smiled from the door she was holding two coffee cups 
 & gt redcheer : i brought you a mid afternoon coffee but it looks like you beat me to it 
 i smiled at redcheer and looked down at the two delicious cups in front of me 
 & gt me : yeah 
 & gt redcheer : two coffees is a bit much it would almost be irresponsible to give you a third 
 & gt me : oh give it to me anyway as a backup 
 redcheer looked at me <unk> as she walked over and placed a third cup down on my desk 
 & gt me : thatguy is <unk> & gt redcheer : thatguy 
 i had forgotten redcheer wasn’t at the meeting 
 i decided to tell her the entire story 
 after describing it to her i felt a little better 
 redcheer looked a little angry though ... & gt redcheer : what a little <unk> $ # ard and… all you did is kick him out 
 & gt me : well… he’s meant to be here for his one on one session but he’s over an hour late 
 i don’t think he’s gon na show up 
 & gt redcheer : what a f* & amp # ing time <unk> 
 the coffee smell from the three coffees in front of me was giving me perspective 
 & gt me : nah 
 he’s just awkward maybe 
 & gt redcheer : well f* % $ that guy 
 i laughed as redcheer left the room 
 i’d heard that somewhere before 
 ***** thursday morning i’d been called up urgently to the head of accounting 
 upon arriving at the accounting department i bumped into orangetie 
 & gt orangetie : airz 
 & gt me : oh hello 
 an awkward pause as i realised i didn’t actually remember <unk> name 
 & gt orangetie : i’ve changed every password i had to something new after your talk 
 & gt me : er… good 
 & gt orangetie : i take it you’re here for <unk> error 
 & gt me : <unk> 
 yes 
 maybe 
 i’m looking for your boss 
 orangetie smiled and gestured over to <unk> office 
 upon reaching the <unk> office i saw the headac looking <unk> at his computer 
 & gt headac : look whats <unk> the screen showed an account error 
 i wasn’t familiar with the software though 
 & gt headac : the numbers don’t match 
 we’re meant to pay out x for all the employees for payday but this week we’re paying out <unk> <unk> wrong 
 & gt me : err… & gt headac : tell me whats wrong 
 i took another look at the software 
 a <unk> was showing on the pay 
 software 
 & gt <unk> invalid** *bank details <unk> *bank not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> & gt me : oh… who is user <unk> 
 headac searched the user id 
 & gt headac : its <unk> what the <unk> i took a look at the screen 
 the employee details were there but underneath banking details someone had changed the <unk> name to : asks to many questions 
 and every number field to <unk> 
 headac looked up at me 
 his eyes searching for answers 
 & gt headac : computer error 
 & gt me : no chance 
 & gt headac : s @ & amp t. ***** next comic thanks <unk> 
 looks amazing : previous tuesday afternoon 
 “that guy” one manages to be hired in every company 
 he always manages to make meetings take forever by asking the most <unk> things 
 the following is a battle with my <unk> not to murder “that guy” : ***** i’d been asked to host a talk on computer security as i arrived i noticed the room was filled with people 
 i smiled at the assembled crowd 
 the head of security walked over he was happy 
 & gt headsec : all ready 
 look how many people turned up… & gt me : yep 
 i handed over a usb stick to headsec 
 & gt headsec : powerpoint 
 i nodded my head 
 he <unk> happiness at me 
 turning to face the assembled crowd i tried to look as friendly as possible before starting my talk ... my first mistake 
 & gt me : when leaving your computer for an extended period of time 
 lock the session 
 a hand shot up from the crowd 
 in my head i tossed up leaving questions till the end 
 i decided it was okay to answer them as we went 
 my second mistake 
 & gt thatguy : how long is an extended period of time 
 & gt me : if you can’t see your computer and you 're away for more then a minute 
 lock your session 
 <unk> “that guy” 
 third mistake 
 & gt thatguy : what if someone comes to your desk and asks you a question 
 so you turn around to face them 
 you ca n't see your computer and the answer will take longer then a <unk> 
 should you lock it then 
 & gt me : i think a bit of common sense would tell you that its okay to leave it unlocked if you’re sitting at your desk 
 now i’m not sure if the <unk> insult landed or he was just this disruptive always but he became <unk> 
 & gt thatguy : how far 
 would *you* say a person has to be before locking the session on a computer is required 
 & gt me : just as soon as they 've left their desk 
 thatguy smiled 
 then <unk> a look of confusion 
 & gt thatguy : sorry 
 just to be <unk> 
 as soon as they’ve left 
 so even like … a metre away 
 & gt me : sure 
 on to passwords 
 i smiled again at the audience 
 my patience running thin 
 bad cop grumbled 
 the next slide displayed on the screen 
 & gt me : don’t share your passwords 
 ever 
 don’t even write them down 
 a hand shot up again from the audience 
 i looked at its owner 
 “that guy” 
 nope 
 & gt me : i think we’ll save questions till the end 
 & gt thatguy : oh i’ll forget them all if you do that 
 i stared down at him 
 badcop took over my eyes 
 i’m fairly certain i death stared him 
 & gt thatguy : okay 
 fair enough 
 anyone got a pen 
 i need to write my questions down 
 thatguy was now standing up looking around for a pen 
 no one seemed to have one 
 & gt thatguy : no one with a pen 
 <unk> it would be totally easier if you just answered my questions now… 
 i just stared at him 
 i <unk> 
 i was on my second slide 
 : bad cop already wanted out 
 next previous ***** i walked over to the cupboard i knew held the water pumps 
 as i opened it a <unk> red headed lady approached me from behind 
 & gt redcheer : hello 
 i jumped a little 
 not realizing someone was behind me 
 & gt me : oh hey sorry 
 are you trying to get in here 
 i pointed to the cupboard then realized it was full of equipment only it would need 
 & gt redcheer : haha i’ve come to help you 
 & gt me : er… are you a tech 
 i thought there was only one 
 & gt redcheer : i’m a designer 
 but i wan na help you it’ll get my creative juices flowing 
 i looked down at the water pumps i’d never installed one before 
 probably should n't let people know that 
 & gt me : oh i’ll be okay 
 & gt redcheer : i wasn’t asking silly 
 now you grab those tools 
 i’ll get the pump boxes 
 i got back to the desk and wondered if they expected me to help everyone with design 
 surely not right 
 & gt redcheer : okay whats first 
 & gt me : we got ta read the instructions 
 opening a box i <unk> out the instructions for installing 
 & gt redcheer : <unk> 
 let’s skip that step 
 & gt me : okay how about you open all the boxes and put all the pieces next to each computer 
 she seemed much happier with doing manual labor 
 she got to work 
 the instructions were super dull 
 basically install the sump do the <unk> check all the seals install into the pc 
 & gt redcheer : what now 
 she was super keen 
 & gt me : we got ta take a sump and install it into the case 
 i grabbed the screwdrivers required 
 i started install it into the first pc 
 & gt redcheer : let me do one 
 & gt me : do… you know how 
 red headed ladies demeanor changed <unk> 
 her smile wiped off her face 
 & gt redcheer : are… you saying i can’t 
 i remembered my good first impressions idea 
 i started smiling 
 & gt me : oh just checking you know what you’re doing 
 this is expensive equipment 
 & gt redcheery : give me that… she took the screwdriver out of my hand started installing the pump 
 & gt redcheery : this is more fun 
 she started smiling again the <unk> was back 
 after she’d announced she’d completed the first pump i looked inside the computer 
 it was <unk> everything was installed properly 
 & gt me : oh… just… nice 
 & gt redcheery : haha starting to see me as more then just a pretty face huh 
 & gt me : err yeah 
 i went back to installing the pump on a different machine and cheery moved onto her second computer 
 & gt redcheery : it is fun 
 i think i’ll help you out all week 
 & gt me : don’t you have… work to do 
 i looked around at the other people working 
 they didn’t look like they had time to spare 
 & gt redcheery : don’t worry you’ll help me with it right 
 & gt me : err… 
 i don’t know anything about design 
 & gt redcheery : haha i’ll teach you 
 plus dad said you’re great at <unk> 
 i was confused who was she related to 
 & gt me : sorry… dad 
 & gt redcheery : the boss of this office 
 & gt me : carefree 
 & gt redcheery : yeah 
 he says you’re a designer in <unk> 
 so we can help each other right 
 i looked back over at the installed pump 
 it was done pretty well 
 without instructions too 
 could be a worse <unk> right 
 & gt redcheery : ouch 
 <unk> darn it 
 her shout made me look back over at the red headed lady beside me her hand had a huge <unk> through it 
 & gt me : oh f & amp # $ 
 & gt redcheery : woah 
 don’t swear that’s way to negative 
 it’s okay just a scratch 
 her hand was bleeding it was a fairly deep cut 
 blood was about to drip down onto the computer 
 & gt me : ummm lets go get your hand treated 
 & gt redcheery : oh no 
 it’s okay this is my machine now 
 i’ve decided 
 the blood started dripping down onto the top of the newly installed sump 
 & gt me : we should probably go get your hand treated 
 plus blood isn’t great for electronics 
 & gt redcheery : haha if i give it a little blood now me and my computers bond will be great and we’ll be able to design good things together 
 i was seriously worried about her sanity at this point 
 & gt redcheery : plus its only going on the sump 
 & gt me : okay come on blood sacrifice over 
 & gt redcheery : haha its not that weird 
 it hurt me now i’ll feel connected to that computer 
 designers are like that okay 
 we walked over to the break room sink 
 i realized i didn’t know where any medical <unk> was in this new office… 
 hand of the <unk> daughter cut whilst working on it… 
 how bad 
 next obviously fake name 
 anyways a while ago i was working a contract for a rather significant pharmaceutical company 
 it was your standard <unk> 1st line maybe 2nd line type role with a clear difference 
 our manager was great 
 <unk> offered good career advice when you needed it always had your back when the proverbial hit the fan guided us through some difficult times with lunch on the company card or the odd tin of quality street 
 the guy was excellent - one of the few times i could <unk> say it 
 however good things do n't last and as higher ups decided that support was way too happy decided to <unk> of our <unk> leader much to the cue of oh captain my captain '' upon his departure 
 enter angie ... there are few words to describe angie 
 we 'd heard tell of her actions and personality through her previous subjects during our morning coffees around the <unk> 
 apparently she would snipe and shout at you for merely existing and applied the logic of a 3 year old suffering major attention <unk> disorder at a lecture on string theory 
 angie had been in charge of drug safety for about a decade 
 to put it into perspective if you took this company 's product and turned into a blue <unk> that shot fire the <unk> would contact her department for advice 
 now from what i could tell these guys seemed to be very well <unk> in everything from <unk> <unk> and some were even former doctors 
 none of this sheer brilliance washed with angie she merely treated them like tools that she had no idea how to use and would bang with a hammer when they worked her way - even if her way was clearly stupid 
 still - judge no book by their cover and all that 
 angie arrived in support a day early mere moments after our former hero had walked the long mile 
 she immediately proceeded to command facilities to join her at her desk where she chewed out a 17 year old girl <unk> due to there being dust on her desk and grit in her drawers 
 this <unk> torture went on for a good 20 minutes while angie inspected every inch of the girl 's effort to appease her whims even <unk> several spots more than once 
 afterwards she walked away red faced eyes to the ground and with a lump in her throat after just about getting the words to indicate she will have her drawer pack replaced with a brand new unit 
 we all knew it was to be a new world order with angie 's arrival we would have thought her showing up a day early was to meet and greet the troops ... it was very apparent to me that she was just a <unk> <unk> marking her territory showing everyone who was boss 
 suffice it to say we finished up the day typing up <unk> and comparing <unk> recently left school and started in a big it company as an apprentice so i 'm still learning a lot 
 every new it apprentice starts in the first level support to get a general overview of all the support cases that come in from our employees 
 we have a ticket system and also a hotline so one day a lady calls since we see the name on the phone display my colleagues <unk> ignored the call so it goes over to me 
 i did n't think much about it and picked it up 
 **me : ** name <unk> how can i help you '' 
 **lady : ** i opened up the excel file my colleague sent me via email but it does n't seem to open up properly can you build up a remote connection and take a look at it '' 
 **me : ** sure give me a second '' 
 after i had remote access on her computer i tried to open up the excel window since the program was clearly running 
 nothing happened but the program seemed to be responding so i opened up <unk> to see the process status 
 everything looked fine 
 then one thing my colleague said to me on the first day came to mind 
 always think that the customer you have on the phone never touched a computer before '' 
 since every employee at our company has a second monitor i asked her : **me : ** can you check if the window opened up on your second monitor '' 
 **lady : ** wait let me turn it on first '' yes it opened up but the window looks odd can you see it '' 
 **me : ** no i can only see your main monitor so you need to move the window to the other monitor '' 
 **lady : ** so can you see it now normally it looks different '' 
 kinda confused i look at the window and it looked completely fine 
 **me : ** whats wrong with the window you need to be a little more specific '' 
 **lady : ** the size the window should be way bigger '' 
 **me : ** ah thats what you meant you can maximize the window size with the button you can see up here in the right corner '' 
 the lady hung up and left me behind confused how my company can hire people without the most basic computer skills 
 it 's tough to be the it guy ..i got a trouble call from one of our <unk> video edit rooms 
 this was back when we still used tape to tape <unk> editing so this room was special '' 
 so special that they had sent the expert '' from ny to install it without telling us or even saying hello 
 anyway the room had a funny smell and the <unk> pointed to a little ups on the floor which was smoking and the sides were bulging 
 i told her to stop editing save her work and shut her workstation off 
 we needed to get the ups out of there immediately 
 she said that she was on deadline and the ny expert '' had told her to always use a ups to protect her work 
 she wanted a guarantee that nothing would go wrong if we removed her ups 
 i told her that she will never get such a guarantee from me about <unk> but that i could almost guarantee that her project will be lost if she continued to use the smoking ups 
 she reluctantly shut down her system 
 the <unk> thing is that we have an <unk> <unk> ups for technical power which is far more reliable than the crappy $ 100 desktop <unk> unit she loved so much 
 i work it for a small office of about 40 people 
 it is part of a larger organisation that has hundreds of different types of sites across the nation and as such also has a <unk> it helpdesk that i 'm not a part of 
 my story is short and sweet 
 on monday morning i received the following email literally ctrl+c <unk> except the name changes : & gt help me <unk> <unk> and <unk> are n't on this computer and i know i can 'd lodge a ticket with the it support desk as its against thier policy 
 in my defense it was monday morning and my coffee level was still <unk> low so i did what *technically* i 'm supposed to do in such a situation that is being asked to break company <unk> code of conduct etc ... and simply forwarded the email to the newbie 's manager to let them deal with it then i went about my business read : i went onto reddit and other internet research '' 
 this morning the manager i forwarded the email to came in to thank me for giving her a reason to fire the newbie as she <unk> did n't like him as a person* '' 
 and then handed me a <unk> bar 
 <unk> company just rolled out a new web-based system for people to use for <unk> etc 
 part of the <unk> involved deleting the browser cache and old favorites links etc 
 if they did n't do this the website would n't show correctly 
 one user i had was having issues clearing out the cache 
 been working with him for over 20 minutes trying different ways to explain it & amp just ca n't grip the terms somehow ... i click <unk> 
 where is <unk> 
 *note : ca n't remote access his pc otherwise i 'd just do it for him* finally i 'm just about ready to give up and escalate it when i had an idea 
 & gt me : ok user one last thing 
 when you use the internet at home do you ever have to delete anything you would n't want certain people to see like your significant other or someone like that 
 & gt user : oh yeah 
 hold on a sec <unk> of clicks and a small muttering of sound* & gt user : yep the site works 
 thanks 
 <unk> : the internet is for ... <unk> : ** there is this guy - let 's call him pete 
 pete comes in the it department every month or so because <unk> computer fails <unk> 
 actually <unk> computer does n't fail on it 's own - pete just does n't know how to properly watch porn on the internet 
 <unk> : ** porn pete how we call him comes in to our it department and rages about that *something <unk> again on the internet* and that we just need to run *the <unk> again <unk> rescue boot disk 
 my colleague starts his computer and what pops up while porn pete stands beside him 
 yep - a <unk> of the <unk> department of <unk> '' fraud malware 
 the <unk> : the malware made a shot with the webcam of him **while he sat naked in front of his computer <unk> oh and by the way pete is about 60 and one <unk> dude 
 bricks were be <unk> and the whole it laughed to tears 
 made our <unk> story 
 this one boils my blood 
 <unk> note this story does not take place in the <unk> i used to work as printer support for a small business 
 these printers were actually x-ray printers which would produce digital quality images from <unk> machines and such using our provided equipment 
 pretty fancy 
 nightmare to install and troubleshoot 
 also bear in mind that since this is a very specialized kind of equipment it was n't like you could google '' the answer since most of the problems would be user related or hardware errors 
 it 's also worth mentioning that the closest piece of equipment we had was about 3-4 hours away with no way to remote into these <unk> 
 when i joined i did n't have any kind of experience dealing with this kind of equipment 
 i was told anything i needed to know would be provided to me and i would be trained accordingly 
 <unk> first day at work : the training i received was in the form of a pdf manual with <unk> pages and the product orientation '' was going to the website of the product and reading anything that was there 
 everything else was figure it out '' 
 enough ranting and background 
 on with the story 
 $ me : yours truly $ ot : other tech 
 quite knowledgeable and cool dude 
 $ manager : regional manager of the company & gt $ manager : i just got a call from $ client who is at least 3 hours away driving through mountains and dangerous <unk> and they are not able to print 
 & gt $ ot : ok i 'll give them a call and- & gt $ manager : no 
 they are upset and are threatening to return the equipment if we do n't help them now 
 & gt $ me : rushing that 's at least a 3 hour drive while a phone call can resolve the issue in 3 minutes or less 
 & gt $ manager : i do n't care 
 i want someone there now 
 *sigh* earlier that day $ ot 's car had broken down and it was at the shop with no reasonable eta 
 so it fell on me and my whole 2 weeks of training '' to solve the <unk> of this machine 
 after driving through <unk> and dangerous paths to get there during which one of many trips i witnessed an accident right before my eyes where 3 people died but that 's a story for another day i get off my car head in the hospital into the x-ray imaging room to see the hospital 's manager fiddling with the machine and printing as usual 
 at this point i wanted to murder anybody inside that tiny cold <unk> and <unk> office but being the nice it i am the only thing that popped out : & gt $ me : oh it 's printing 
 that 's good 
 what did you guys do 
 & gt $ <unk> : i just <unk> it and it worked 
 & gt $ me : that 's great 
 let me take a look at the logs and i 'll be on my way 
 i took the damn thing off took it to a <unk> room so the special printing <unk> would n't go to waste and quietly <unk> at the incompetence of higher ups for not letting me make a single phone call 
 needless to say i quit 3 months afterwards and the company dissolved 1 1/2 months later after that 
 tl dr i drove 3 hours to sit in a <unk> room to cry with a special printer 
 edit : formatting edit 2 : wow 
 thanks a lot for the support guys 
 also quote of the day 
 big thank you first tale and italian so excuse me for my mistakes and poor english : august 2014 i 'm on holiday in <unk> with a friend of mine 
 we are on the beach relaxing under the sun with two <unk> 
 & gt <unk> <unk> *my friend receives an <unk> & gt **friend** : it 's my mum she has some troubles with the notebook 
 you 're the it guy can you help her 
 & gt **me** : which kind of troubles 
 & gt **friend** : she says the screen is n't working anymore she went to a computer shop and they say she probably will have to change the screen 
 & gt **me** : did they look carefully 
 sometimes it is not the screen but the little cable that connects the screen to the motherboard that is damaged & gt <unk> writes to mum* & gt **friend** : wait she says she put the videocard in the oven 
 & gt **me** : she did what 
 & gt **friend** : she disassembled the notebook and put the videocard in the oven & gt **me** : which videocard 
 her notebook does not have a dedicated videocard 
 and why the hell did she put something in the oven 
 & gt **friend** : now she says some parts of the videocard are missing i choked on my <unk> 
 edit : typos thank you <unk> edit2 : typos again 
 angie arrives in tech support and starts work 
 a few tech support underlings had moved her machine down the previous evening but from what i had heard she had had another chewing out session as she preferred her monitor on the left hand side as opposed to the right 
 ok a simple mistake to make and one which is easily <unk> - not without a lot of noise and assurance of stupidity 
 i did wonder why i found our resident work experience kid close to tears in the <unk> 
 i sat down and began my day 
 at 10:00 my first interaction with this hellhound was imminent 
 i was busy tapping out a response email to a remote worker about an excel problem and she beckoned me over 
 well - i say beckoned she clicked her fingers and with an <unk> commanding tone she scowled you 
 come here '' 
 thinking i could n't possibly have had enough time to annoy the woman yet i assumed this was just another <unk> display of power sorry been listening to <unk> this morning 
 however she then demanded i showed her how to access her email 
 now i 'm used to running it inductions and showing new users the jig but someone who 's been here for 10 years 
 hmmm 
 so i managed to show her where outlook was amidst the utter blur of icons on her desktop adorned with a background of her several <unk> <unk> - figures 
 as outlook <unk> churned into gear she immediately snapped why does it take so long '' 
 ok in fairness this was taking ages 
 her disapproving sighs as i attempted to determine the cause was all the signal i needed to know that i really had n't impressed the boss from hell 
 task manager showed outlook knocking on 97 % cpu and the hard disk was going nuts 
 until i noticed that network packets had also <unk> up 
 <unk> up the voice to break through the <unk> icy air i politely enquired when is the last time you opened outlook '' 
 this was met with a sharp stare and do n't be stupid 
 why would i ask you how to use it if i had been using it already '' 
 after waiting several minutes the cause eventually became clear 
 angie was presented with approximately 5 years worth of completely unread <unk> - an unsettling amount of them marked urgent or with subjects <unk> fatal consequences had occured totally without her knowledge 
 as i said angie had headed drug safety for a decade 
 in that time she had never seen a single email nor did it seem had she ever any cause to question why 
 and now she was in our realm - <unk> our happy little team with a blackness mired with incompetence and only a tongue <unk> with the <unk> of hell to act as her only <unk> 'm the guy responsible for handling all the support calls in the morning 
 this morning i check the queue and see a ticket from a user saying the phone software has disappeared from his computer 
 at my work we use a remote support program where we can direct the user to our help site have them click our name and download a file and it will let us remote in and fix their issues 
 i called the user and told him i would be happy to help 
 i said please open a web browser for me '' 
 he replies <unk> i 'm gon na be completely honest with you 
 i do n't mess with computers like that '' 
 so i ended up having to send one of my techs out there probably just to replace the desktop shortcut for the missing '' program 
 this happened about 10 minutes into my day and i 'm already fucking done 
 <unk> i called yesterday to try and talk to the night shift worker but was told he would be working the day shift this morning 
 i 'm going to call over there in a few minutes to make sure we fixed his issue and see if he will let me remote in to check the logs 
 if he <unk> n't do that i 'll just get the service tag from the machine and use it to look up the <unk> address and have one of the it engineering guys remote in they do n't need the user to let them in and check for <unk> in response to the last closing account post someone in the comments said i hope you are the only isp in the area so i thought i would share this lovely story with you all 
 well as it happens i am ceo of *** broadband 
 we are the only broadband provider in a large part of our rural coverage area 
 had a woman rent a house on a 6 month contract in a <unk> <unk> area 5 mins outside of the local <unk> - she moved in everything was fine 
 then one day a storm went through the area 
 it took out the power lines and access to a hill where the transmitter tower was located which served her 
 she rang up the help desk and said her husband was missing out on work because they couldnt get the incoming phone calls 
 the tone of voice and attitude was unacceptable 
 the support rep <unk> and said once the weather improves one of our techs who was already on site will be able to get up on a <unk> bike with a generator and charge up the backup batteries 
 the power lines company managed to get the power back on at the bottom of the hill before he got up on the <unk> bike 
 a week later same thing happened and this time when she called she was much more abusive 
 i took over the call this time and politely informed her that due to the flooding her husband wouldnt be able to get to work if he was called because the only bridge into the area was closed for safety reasons 
 this was preventing us from getting on site with our generator 
 she <unk> more abuse at me so i said that if she speaks to me or any of my staff like that again i am cutting her off 
 it happened a third time - she accidentally unplugged her voip ata with the <unk> cleaner 
 the notes on her account said if she is abusive to instantly hang up on her and cancel the account so thats what the support rep did 
 she called me that afternoon literally crying like a 6 year old trying to explain a <unk> because she was stuck in a contract on the house rental for another 5 months and couldnt move back into the city due to the cost of early termination of the house contract 
 i told her she had two warnings and we dont have to put up with people like you '' who cant appreciate how hard it is to do what we do 
 never heard from her again 
 edit : many of you are concerned about my lack of <unk> or the fact i did not <unk> her connection when she called crying at the end 
 she didnt even try to say sorry - she was just trying to justify herself which i did not accept 
 it actually reminded me of a scene from <unk> where <unk> wants to be <unk> and <unk> 
 this just happened an hour ago and i could n't resist sharing it with you all 
 ___ & gt **user : ** hi yeah i 'm having trouble signing into my email do you know my password '' 
 & gt **me : ** hi who am i speaking with '' 
 & gt **user : ** oh i 'm **talldense & amp amp dumb** from <unk> reality & amp amp <unk> '' & gt **me : ** his **talldense & amp amp dumb** sorry we do n't keep your passwords listed 
 i can try to help out though 
 worst case we can just reset the password '' 
 & gt **td & amp amp d : ** okay this is what it says : '' <unk> out standard username/password field letter by letter asterisks and all* & gt **td & amp amp d : ** ... 
 <unk> '' 
 & gt **me : ** alright no problem just enter in the password you use to log in '' 
 & gt **td & amp amp d : ** well if i knew that i would n't have a problem '' 
 & gt **me : ** sorry i mean the password you use to unlock the computer '' 
 & gt **td & amp amp d : ** yeah i know what you meant '' 
 & gt **me : ** do you never lock your computer or log out at all '' 
 & gt **td & amp amp d : ** no '' 
 *facepalm* & gt **me : ** that 's really insecure i 'd definitely recommend at least locking your computer when you leave the office if not logging out completely '' 
 & gt **td & amp amp d : ** what do you mean you guys are supposed to handle the computer security '' 
 & gt **me : ** well yeah but that 's like having 2 <unk> and a combo lock on your front door but always leaving it wide open '' 
 & gt **td & amp amp d : ** oh i got it now forgot to capitalize 
 thanks '' 
 & gt **me : ** <unk> '' *click* & gt '' fuck '' 
 <unk> 
 * **tl dr : maybe you should turn off the <unk> sign above your computer reading steal my data it 's free '' ** ___ checked his pc 's <unk> the guy was n't lying 
 edit : i work at an msp and this is one of our clients 
 i have no say on their group policy <unk> i could set them myself but that could also get me into trouble as that 's not something i have the power to decide 
 but after verifying via the <unk> that was not the case which the ticket was submitted through mind you jumping remotely onto 5 random <unk> systems from the site and browsing i called the user who filed the ticket 
 it went like this : me : hi there this is <unk> and i received a trouble ticket that i need some more info on 
 it was stated that the internet was down but all our tests indicate it is working correctly 
 can you be more specific 
 user : my web browser wo n't display pages 
 i 've tried rebooting and <unk> 
 *i pop on user 's system via <unk> me : the fact that i can get to you this way is a good sign 
 let 's take a peek 
 * i instinctively open up google and it comes up instantly 
 i do a quick search and hit a random but safe link 
 me : it appears to be up to me 
 is there a specific website you 're having trouble with 
 user : yeah umm 
 facebook 
 *user types in facebook and it fails to load 
 * me : that is likely an issue with facebook 
 it even says it has an issue on the screen 
 facebook displayed a something went wrong '' message 
 user : no facebook ca n't be down 
 there must be something wrong with our systems 
 me : & amp # <unk> & amp # <unk> *i do a twitter search for # <unk> tag and show her a few hundred <unk> in the last 10 minutes 
 * it appears to me facebook 
 give it a bit it should come back up 
 user : do you mean i found a problem you ca n't fix 
 ha 
 i stumped you 
 me : <unk> 
 <unk> 
 more comments <unk> from <unk> 
 edit : i love you <unk> rolls around 
 angie is already sat in the stale meeting room waiting for me 
 obviously given the events of the day before i knew i had essentially caused this impromptu ticket review 
 to me there remained two choices 
 i could head in there a <unk> professional <unk> for my <unk> and be managed 
 yep be managed by angie 
 as she had already <unk> three of my colleagues into <unk> states i realised this tactic was doomed 
 however my heavy metal spirit <unk> i took a cue from <unk> <unk> and instead presented myself as just me 
 the guy who will still smile and offer <unk> with a light <unk> stance even in the face of a total <unk> 
 i walked into the meeting room brandishing a pint glass of red <unk> which i happily placed on the desk 
 i honestly do n't think angie was expecting this one 
 i <unk> sat down and acted like i was eager to go through any concerns she had with my tickets 
 she came straight out with it i want to know why you close the lowest amount of tickets out of everyone in the group 
 this is n't good enough you are consistently the lowest score in every single <unk> i have '' 
 my case revolved around the fact that we were never <unk> by stats 
 ever 
 we maintained a low <unk> count and <unk> on mentoring junior staff and leading by example 
 i was hired as a senior simply as a representation of my experience and it was not uncommon for me to accompany junior staff on their calls 
 as you can guess as well as a frosty stare this was met with a <unk> <unk> : rubbish '' 
 she <unk> 
 she <unk> for another 10 minutes scribbling all over her prints in red pen like a crap maths teacher and proceeded to throw me ticket after ticket and reasons why she was n't happy 
 that 's ok i do n't stop there 
 after she finishes her rant i decide i can play your game 
 i turn her stack of <unk> paperwork over and begin to go through them in depth one by one to answer her concerns 
 this ticket here i started you were unhappy as it took too long to resolve 
 i admit three weeks is a little out there 
 however this pc is running some <unk> medical software and as it happens will only run on windows nt 
 the department is not willing to shell out five figures on a new <unk> version so they asked us to source a replacement motherboard instead '' 
 now here 's how i knew we had a rat 
 angie has no idea what nt is - or even a motherboard 
 however her <unk> this time seemed more bitter and twisted 
 i was really stirring the <unk> nest here 
 i insisted on moving on after i can take your comments on board '' 
 i started into the next ticket 
 this ticket resolved around a new vendor requiring set up of several <unk> databases ... '' angie stopped me mid sentence 
 she reiterated <unk> my low call count if i did n't shape up she would have no option but to <unk> disciplinary steps 
 ok so i did n't win 
 but at least the playing field has been set 
 i do n't back down though i know i wo n't win 
 but at least now i know what her prize is 
 why i do n't know 
 she ca n't be after everyone 's job surely 
 that makes no sense 
 **epilogue** angie left for the day 
 i was alone watching a new hp laptop complete a windows install ready to fine tune and install later to <unk> 
 the balding head of it wandered over to ask what all the meetings were about today 
 i <unk> <unk> and shared my thoughts in as diplomatic a manner i could 
 i expressed how i was the lowest ticket closer and angie is n't happy about that 
 initially balding head bhit tried to <unk> me asking how i could do better 
 blimey i 'd forgotten higher ups were meant to help '' 
 however he soon discovered my tickets for what they were all mine were the complex issues 
 internal wifi <unk> preparing master <unk> for different models of routers the sales reps had troubleshooting legacy windows nt and <unk> <unk> systems ... and then i landed everyone in it 
 compared to some others it seems the bulk majority of calls assigned by people to themselves in the mornings were password resets ... i guess that 's one way to boost your stats ... <unk> ... did i just <unk> my team so as i 'm typing this it 's a few minutes short of 4am 
 this happened a little under an hour ago 
 i 'm family tech support and sometimes school tech support 
 so i 'm sitting in my room playing <unk> space program and i here my phone ring 
 i recognize the ringtone 
 it 's either my mom my sister or my former boss 
 never good news at this time in the morning 
 i look at it and see it 's my mom 
 i find that disturbing because i know she 's just on the other end of the house 
 me : it 's 3am what do you want and why did n't you just come here 
 mom : i have a problem with my laptop 
 me : why did n't you just bring it to me 
 mom : that 's the problem 
 whenever i unplug it it dies 
 i knew this was coming 
 it 's an ibm thinkpad <unk> 
 it 's gon na die soon 
 me : okay you know my fee 
 mom : okay 
 i just need the computer 
 me : i 'll be there in a couple minutes 
 i establish a stable <unk> and go down the hall 
 me : so every time you unplug it it dies 
 mom : yeh 
 me : you try turning it off and back on again 
 she gives me the death glare 
 mom : do you ever want to be able to eat again 
 me : do you ever want to use your computer again 
 mom : <unk> 
 me : you drop it lately 
 mom : no 
 me : knock it over 
 mom : no 
 me : you still leaving it on its side like i told you not to 
 mom : it does n't hurt it 
 me : it 's the cat that would hurt it 
 mom : well i found it on its side the other day 
 i look at it 
 look at her 
 look at it 
 i turn it over and jiggle the battery 
 me : should work 
 mom : what 
 me : it should work 
 mom : i do n't believe you 
 me : double or nothing my fee it works 
 my fee for my mom is dinner out 
 mom : deal 
 i unplug it it gives the cable unplugged beep and continues on its day 
 i stand up and walk out 
 me : i 'll be collecting one of those tonight 
 she just grumbled under her breath 
 that took me 10 minutes and i got 2 <unk> out out of it 
 edit : i typed this at 4am 
 i had a <unk> helpdesk usually consists of four staff and the supervisor 
 on this day they were less than half <unk> and they were very busy 
 postroom calls them and asks it to collect a package because postroom are <unk> and too busy to do a post run 
 it replies that no sorry we are also short <unk> and can not leave the phones unattended 
 some time passes 
 helpdesk get a call from reception 
 & gt recep : the mouse is n't working 
 please come up urgently we ca n't route calls 
 our <unk> pfy $ <unk> leaves $ <unk> to hold the fort alone and <unk> to another floor of the building 
 it 's about as far away from it as you can get 
 reception and postroom have the same staff 
 you see where this is going 
 & gt pfy : this mouse is working fine 
 & gt recep : oh i know we just wanted you to come and collect this package 
 what did reception really <unk> that day 
 all front office tickets are now lower than lowest priority 
 tldr : oh we did n't really have any urgent post for you to collect but can you please take this laptop to the front office for us 
 i 've been *the computer guy* for many a year and have seen some weird stuff going on but this really takes the cake 
 some time back i was engaged to provide some i.t 
 services to a user $ r 
 $ r had a naim networked music player 
 for those not in the know this is a music player that connects to media shares and <unk> music 
 what i could make out over the <unk> call was that $ r was having issues with his web browser 
 i arranged for a site visit since he had <unk> all the usual options - reinstalling java & amp flash trying different browsers <unk> firefox & amp chrome 
 turns out $ r was having issues with logging into the web interface of the naim 
 no matter what he tried the login page would turn up blank 
 i gave it a try and <unk> the login page loads up just fine 
 & gt $ r : what did you do '' 
 & gt me : i do n't know but i think i have that effect on computers '' 
 & gt $ r : yeah i 've seen this before 
 you computer guys seem to really strike the fear into computers and make them <unk> '' 
 with the problem solved i left after setting up the new <unk> network shares for him on the naim 
 a week later i receive another call from him - the issue has <unk> 
 i try to run him through the usual troubleshooting options of clearing the cache et al 
 to no avail 
 & gt $ r : hang on lem me put you on speaker while i get at it '' 
 & gt me : sure 
 hey you know what i 'm in the area so let me head down and take a look at your computer '' 
 & gt r $ : what the '' 
 & gt me : what '' 
 & gt r $ : i think the imac heard you 
 it loaded up right when you said you were gon na come down '' 
 & gt me : <unk> 
 i 'm glad i could be of help '' 
 & gt r $ : listen this is probably going to sound weird but i 'll pay you $ 50 if you could <unk> me your <unk> '' 
 & gt me : what '' 
 & gt r $ : yeah seems like this machine really fears you 
 i 'm going to print your <unk> out frame it and hang it on the wall to put the fear into it '' 
 it 's $ 50 for doing next to nothing so i did and he did 
 i have n't heard from him in the last year and a half 
 tl dr - some computers are <unk> and fear *the computer guy* 
 **background** this happened about a year ago when i was a senior in high school 
 at the time i was the webmaster intern for the school and my boss '' was the head of the business department 
 his friend was $ boss from the local home <unk> agency and needed somebody to <unk> their website seeing as it was very outdated 
 cue $ me being hired as on-site tech support and webmaster 
 *2 months later on a <unk> i busted a <unk> driving to the office so after a lot of swearing i put on the spare and call $ boss to let him know i 'll be late 
 while on phone $ boss lets me know that the network was down and that i need to fix it when i get in 
 the office was small with only about 10 people actually staying on-site so they use a old office grade router 
 & gt ** $ me** : greets $ boss and walk to server closet 
 & gt checks back of router see that the ethernet cable going to the network switch is undone 
 & gt notice a lot of cables between the switches are missing 
 & gt plug in cables and wait for traffic to resume through the switch 
 & gt pack up and go to desk 
 & gt ** $ boss** : so what was the problem 
 & gt ** $ me** : there was just a <unk> cables undone on the switch 
 & gt ** $ boss** : oh yea 
 i thought i looked messy last week so i got rid of a bunch that did n't seem to need to be there 
 <unk> into <unk> tldr : boss sucks and does n't know how networking works 
 **edit : ** holy crap this post blew up 
 i guess i 'll write some more horror stories from my it experiences lol 
 thanks guys 
 previous as i stood in the car park surrounded by fellow employees i could hear the screams of the vp 
 today was not a good day for him 
 he was currently <unk> at the head of hr 
 & gt vp : what do you mean everyone isn’t accounted for 
 & gt hrhead : well 
 not everyone is assembled here 
 so we can’t give the all clear till we know we’ve got everyone 
 i hadn’t seen anyone from it yet 
 i kept looking 
 & gt vp : its just a f & amp % $ ing drill 
 lets just go back inside 
 & gt hrhead : sorry how did you just speak to me 
 & gt vp : i err… i took a seat on the ground it was cold 
 winter was coming 
 & gt hrhead : have you ever heard of a hostile workplace environment 
 & gt vp : yes and i’m sorry 
 it’s just a drill though 
 can’t we go back inside 
 & gt hrhead : sure do half a <unk> that sounds reasonable 
 & gt vp : fine who the hell is missing 
 & gt hrhead : i’ve no idea 
 can’t we get the heads of department to gather their own employees 
 the vp decided that was a good idea 
 everyone was cold getting inside was my new goal 
 & gt hrhead : airz 
 why are you sitting on the freezing ground 
 go find your department 
 & gt me : i’m not feeling <unk> & gt hrhead : you don’t look great just go find your department then we can all get back inside 
 & gt vp : airz don’t leave my sight 
 i took a walk around the mass of employee’s the vp <unk> my every step 
 i was too sick to call out 
 i couldn’t find any 
 not a single it person 
 about fifteen minutes passed i still couldn’t find a single it person 
 the vp decided to shout at me 
 & gt vp : where is your department 
 & gt me : er… 
 & gt vp : they better not be still inside 
 its getting close to an hour long drill 
 the vp called over his secretary 
 & gt vp : hey vpsec i think i know which employee’s are missing 
 we can’t find it 
 can you go check they aren’t still inside 
 & gt vpsec : walk into a potentially burning building 
 i decided to sit on the ground again it was freezing 
 & gt vp : it 's a drill 
 & gt vpsec : a drill i take very seriously 
 the vp then spent the next half an hour arguing with various people in an attempt to get someone to go check it 
 eventually the cold got too much for the hr manager and she sent the vp’s secretary to go check it 
 & gt vp : so she goes in when you say to 
 & gt headhr : <unk> 
 the vp didn’t look pleased at that 
 he looked pissed 
 about ten minutes later the vp’s secretary returned from it with all the it workers 
 & gt vp : typical airz 
 it’s your department that took over two hours to get outside for a fire drill 
 you should be fired right now 
 i was sitting on the freezing asphalt i didn’t care 
 i wanted to throw up 
 & gt vpsec : actually the alarm wasn’t working down in it ... & gt headhr : no alarm in it 
 thats crazy who’s the fire marshal 
 & gt vp : <unk> i am 
 & gt headhr : and you’re trying to fire someone who in a literal fire would have burnt from your <unk> 
 have you learnt nothing from the current wrongful termination lawsuit 
 the vp was annoyed but not insane 
 & gt vp : i… i think that 's everyone outside now 
 drill over 
 airz 
 come up to my office it 's time to continue our discussion 
 & gt headhr : i think i’ll come too 
 we don’t want to get sued again 
 the vp smiled 
 his smile was wide 
 & gt vp : yes actually having hr in this meeting might be wise 
 i looked up from my seat on the ground i wanted to say something <unk> 
 instead i just sat waiting cold bored 
 next the it cupboard had transformed into a <unk> <unk> of activity 
 boxes of laptops littered every available <unk> in the it cupboard 
 some boxes contained freshly built machines signified by their address labels destined for their new homes 
 others lay brand new yet to be called to command 
 our efforts were <unk> <unk> over by a <unk> samsung monitor which recorded our every move in a single excel spreadsheet 
 names addresses serial numbers asset tags - all required recording 
 despite the obvious pressure qbg and i were under roland seemed content with doing the bare minimum 
 he took his position in the only seat left in the room 
 our demands for action seemed to go unnoticed as he idly fiddled with his phone occasionally breaking his concentration to scroll up and down the excel sheet his arm <unk> to reach an old mouse and keyboard we had rescued from a junk box for our purpose 
 roland <unk> looked up his phone what one are you doing now '' 
 qbg 's response was evidently irate in tone as she read out the serial and asset numbers 
 roland duly tapped in qbg 's response barely even taking the effort to capitalize his text 
 the keyboard old <unk> and not even built with the windows keys <unk> loudly as he typed 
 roland 's attempt to permanently <unk> himself to his throne and rule the <unk> had grown weary 
 after this exchange while <unk> a fresh laptop i decided enough was enough 
 roland '' 
 i started 
 if you 're not going to help could you kindly go back to support '' 
 i 'm busy '' 
 his snide response <unk> on me 
 as if to exemplify his <unk> qbg dragged the keyboard away from towards her as she entered another row of data into the spreadsheet 
 her body language exuded bitterness towards roland 's <unk> <unk> in a stereotypical way that only the female of the <unk> can perfect 
 i knew how she felt though 
 roland sat without a single reaction 
 he seemed to silently shrug off this display of <unk> as if it were of pure <unk> 
 for the next hour we worked around roland uncomfortably as if he were a cold and <unk> heavy rock <unk> situated in the center of the room 
 we had expected angie 's inevitable visit 
 her arrival intensified the high feeling in the cramped environment as we shuffled around box after box of dell laptops 
 she discussed our progress with roland loudly taking great purpose to <unk> mine or qbg 's input 
 roland dutifully <unk> angie with our present number we had imaged repacked and addressed just under 40 laptops 
 the fact is angie could not bear to leave any situation without imposing her sense of authority it just was n't even in her <unk> 
 angie especially liked imposing her authority onto qbg more than almost any other engineer 
 it was though qbg represented everything that angie was not to the letter 
 true to form angie directed her attention towards qbg where she was loading a trolley of <unk> boxes 
 angie 's voice drowned out the whir of the imaging laptops and the <unk> ghost server 
 are these laptops supposed to be finished '' 
 angie 's loaded <unk> was not intended to <unk> any real information 
 qbg duly provided her response knowing that angie had simply just opened her line of questioning to find fault 
 these <unk> labels are entirely too small 
 you need to redo them all in a larger print '' 
 this condescending request <unk> qbg like a whip as she winced at the proposition 
 qbg declined angie 's proposition instead offering we 'll do the next ones bigger these are fine as they are '' 
 angie 's insistence was delivered over a <unk> which seemed almost infinite as she constantly picked up more and more trivial matters of <unk> 
 not enough tape this box is slightly damaged there are too many boxes on that trolley 
 angie satisfied with her instruction retreated back into the <unk> of the office 
 roland remained motionless on his <unk> smugly smiling as he <unk> back into the chair where he stayed for the next hour 
 4pm <unk> into view 
 roland <unk> his dark grey <unk> coat each <unk> <unk> us more and more as their <unk> disturbed our frustrated silence 
 he left for the day without saying a word leaving qbg and me to continue our work 
 his departure was suffixed with our in depth <unk> of the situation 
 as we offered one another further anecdote of why roland and angie both should be buried in shallow <unk> we seemed to further <unk> each other 
 right you know what ... '' i started this is n't happening another day 
 let 's go see bhit '' 
 our <unk> <unk> through the <unk> <unk> towards its seemed to gain in speed the closer we got it was <unk> to a race to reach bhit 
 as he sat blissfully unaware of the onslaught we were about to deliver his balding reflected the ceiling light with a dull shine 
 qbg and i <unk> our way through our complaint as bhit listened 
 our frustrated accounts grew louder as we described in depth what the first day of builds had brought 
 we spilled the beans on roland angie 's <unk> and how the duo were <unk> our attempted rescue with their <unk> 
 bhit pondered our predicament as he <unk> scratched the side of his unshaven head 
 he finally leaned forward and said ok leave it with me 
 get back to work ''

 i didn’t want the vp’s threat to hang over my head 
 i grabbed a coffee and got to work 
 arriving back in my office i looked online for a new job 
 the job market looked terrible 
 just like <unk> 
 and the day before… 
 better to work with what you’ve got coffee whispered to me 
 & gt me : itsec redcheer get in here 
 itsec still looked upset about screwing up redcheer however had bounced back oddly she was smiling 
 & gt me : i just got slammed over your mistakes 
 redcheer’s smile slid off her face 
 & gt me : so consider this a warning 
 one more screw up and your gone 
 & gt itsec : sorry boss 
 & gt redcheer : yeah 
 sorry… boss 
 i looked between the two of them they both looked contrite 
 & gt me : now i’ve got a job for both of you 
 go collect every spare box and piece of cardboard in this building 
 if you see any rubbish foil or <unk> wrapping take that too 
 & gt itsec : where would you like it boss 
 & gt me : make a pile 
 i pointed to the middle of the it area and sat back in my chair as they left 
 that should keep them out of trouble 
 ***** about an hour later a huge pile of cardboard was mounting in the middle of it 
 & gt me : itsec redcheer… you can stop now 
 i looked at the mountain before me 
 & gt itsec : we had to argue with the cleaners to get it… apparently it was all meant to <unk> the recycling plant 
 so this weeks recycling quota will be down 
 & gt me : recycling quota… we don’t have a recycling quota… you know what never mind 
 anyway with this material i want you to make it costumes 
 redcheer and itsec looked confused 
 & gt redcheer : it costumes 
 & gt me : okay redcheer itsec you’re going to an it party 
 it is the theme 
 make costumes with that theme in mind 
 colourblind heard the words redcheer and party and turned around 
 & gt colourblind : party 
 costumes 
 i’m great at that 
 i’ll help you design redcheer 
 his look of excitement was odd 
 <unk> tasks to distract the two screw ups and someone wants in 
 & gt me : get back to work colourblind 
 redcheer <unk> a designer she can handle it 
 i walked away with a smile on my face 
 a thousand boxes and an it theme 
 how hard could it be 
 as i left the office fairly late that night itsec and redcheer were arguing over comfort <unk> style 
 i shook my head as i walked out the door 
 crazy amounts of effort was going into this 
 ***** then next day i walked into the conference room that was meant to hold my it costume help session 
 both itsec and redcheer were already there they looked tired 
 very tired 
 the costume pile behind them however looked oddly impressive 
 behind me the vp walked in the room 
 & gt vp : airz 
 i’m looking forward to this 
 it was at this point he noticed the pile of costumes 
 he looked oddly impressed 
 i <unk> the look until i realized he was carrying my coffee mug 
 & gt me : wait 
 is that my mug 
 & gt vp : oh could be actually 
 i found it on my desk 
 the vp smiled as he took a long sip 
 & gt vp : ahh delicious tea 
 i’ll wash it and get it back to you 
 the room slowly filled with people 
 the least <unk> members of the company 
 & gt vp : we’re gathered here to get some help from airz in regards to the it party being held this week 
 airz… 
 & gt me : as you can see i gestured over to the costume pile behind itsec and redcheer 
 & gt me : we’re come up with a few ideas about costumes 
 however… 
 i paused for effect 
 and looked directly into the tired eyes of itsec and redcheer 
 & gt me : there has been a miscommunication and the party is it themed 
 however the dress code is… 
 smart casual 
 the vp looked oddly annoyed 
 he stood up and spoke rather loudly 
 & gt vp : are you sure 
 & gt me : i am the only one here **on** the organizing committee 
 anyway back to work everyone and remember smart casual for the party 
 people started shuffling out of the office mumbling about how a supposed 2 hour meeting only took 10 minutes and if they should take an extended lunch break to compensate 
 vp wandered out last 
 he looked at me dead in the eye 
 his hand <unk> 
 the coffee cup fell 
 & gt vp : ahh.. the coffee cup split tea all over the vp and bounced off the floor 
 it however didn’t break 
 & gt vp : f* % $ ing thing 
 & gt me : let me get that… i walked over and picked up the coffee cup off the floor whilst smiling at the vp 
 he however was already gone 
 redcheer and itsec looked wrecked 
 i took a look at the pile of costumes 
 & gt me : nice work on the costumes you two 
 i smiled as i walked out the door 
 coffee cup back in hand 
 next previous & gt redcheer : hey airz small <unk> redcheer paused and looked around 
 she spoke quite softly 
 & gt redcheer : my student is a bit of a … <unk> 
 today he tripped and his hand fell on my <unk> 
 & gt me : is it possible he just tripped 
 & gt redcheer : yesterday he <unk> as well 
 two accidental falls in two days both with <unk> action 
 not likely 
 the red haired lady 's face didn’t look pleased at all the <unk> that was going on 
 & gt me : do you want me to have a word 
 & gt redcheer : well i told him to stop 
 then just minutes ago he had another fall this time onto my chest 
 i raised my hand to slap him so fast 
 the colour drained from my face 
 & gt me : please don’t say you hit a child 
 & gt redcheer : i realized just in time 
 however i think we should swap kids 
 <unk> a nightmare 
 speaking of… where is your kid 
 i told redcheer about what happened in hr 
 she laughed and decided swapping still sounded fun 
 eventually i went over to where badshirt was sitting 
 & gt me : hey badshirt i’m working with you for the rest of the day 
 badshirt turned around he was wearing a <unk> 
 t-shirt 
 he looked disappointed 
 i guided badshirt back to my office 
 he sat down on the chair opposite my desk 
 he started looking around the office 
 & gt me : so badshirt what about it do you know 
 & gt badshirt : nothing much 
 i thought you’d teach me stuff 
 i looked at the list of current tickets 
 nothing looked particularly nice 
 teaching time 
 & gt me : okay what about it do you want to learn 
 & gt badshirt : how do you hack someone 
 & gt me : errr 
 hacking isn’t really a good idea 
 ever 
 badshirt finally looked interested a <unk> in his eye ignited 
 & gt badshirt : what if … 
 someone was <unk> you with something and hacking was the only way to get them to stop 
 or… what if someone was trying to frame you for something and hacking was the only way to prove your innocence 
 & gt me : haha interesting ideas 
 i can’t say teaching you hacking is a good idea though 
 & gt badshirt : so… you do know how to hack 
 badshirt started smiling and leaning back slightly in his chair 
 he looked oddly happy 
 & gt me : err… okay lets do some work now yeah 
 & gt badshirt : sure thing 
 badshirt bounced off the chair excitedly and ran around my desk to look at the computer 
 ticket queue was still displayed 
 & gt badshirt : lets do… that one 
 badshirt pointed to a ticket from the marketing department from sassy 
 a lady who i 'd dealt with in the past & gt me : <unk> avoid her 
 & gt badshirt : no i picked that ticket cause of her nice name 
 come on 
 lets go 
 badshirt seemed so keen on working finally 
 so i decided to just go along with it 
 ***** sassy sat at her desk cross armed when badshirt and i arrived 
 her face fell to a frown when she saw me 
 & gt sassy : oh 
 its you 
 & gt badshirt : how can we help <unk> 
 badshirt was giving sassy the broadest smile he could 
 she was taken aback by the <unk> 
 & gt sassy : my mouse isn’t working its a new one that came with this… computer 
 sassy said the word computer with disdain dripping from her words 
 badshirt jumped at pc trying to get the mouse working 
 & gt sassy : the mouse hasn’t been working ever since i got the new computer 
 it’s really slowed my productivity 
 my manager won’t let me leave today until its sorted out 
 & gt badshirt : mmm its not responding at all 
 badshirt flipped the mouse over as i looked up at the clock 
 it was only 10am 
 & gt badshirt : the red light isn’t on 
 probably something to do with the batteries 
 & gt sassy : it’s a new mouse 
 it came with new batteries they’re less then a week old 
 are you telling me this mouse chews through batteries in less then a week 
 badshirt <unk> open the battery cover 
 & gt badshirt : these batteries are wrapped in plastic 
 & gt sassy : is it fixed now 
 badshirt unwrapped the batteries and the mouse started working perfectly 
 he smiled at the good result 
 sassy however was beaming 
 & gt sassy : you’re awesome kid 
 she gave badshirt a hug then loudly proclaimed to the room 
 & gt sassy : <unk> computer is fixed 
 home time 
 sassy got up from her desk and started walking out the door 
 i saw her manager run out from his office to intercept her however didn’t get to see what happened as badshirt started talking 
 & gt badshirt : that was fun 
 & gt me : mmmm 
 yep 
 as we walked back down to it i noticed badshirt was still <unk> from the hug 
 & gt me : haha badshirt looks like you’re in <unk> i waited for the <unk> reply “no” reply 
 chuckling slightly to myself 
 & gt badshirt : i think i am 
 sassy needs me 
 oh god 
 ***** go here for something awesome by /u/wizbam : next names redacted to protect the innocent and guilty 
 it all started with a phone call 
 the whole network at customer redacted is down and they have no power - they need your help '' 
 my blood ran cold 
 the engineer calling me sounded panicked and for good reason 
 customer redacted has an enormous natural gas facility in south texas too far from civilization to get enough power off of the grid 
 we designed and built an onsite natural gas power plant for them - a big one capable of <unk> <unk> of power at peak load 
 they could run the facility for a short while without the power plant but not long - and shutting down the facility meant losing 7 figures per hour 
 by the time i was informed they had 6 hours until they had to shut down 
 as the guy who had designed and installed said network i was naturally the guy to call when it had problems which had never happened before 
 it was a pretty simple network honestly - just switches cat5 cables and fiber 
 since this was the network all the plcs <unk> meters and whatnot ran on it was airgapped & amp isolated no routers 
 not much to go wrong 
 i quickly get on the phone and walk the guy on their end through plugging in a laptop and running some simple tests 
 check lights on things ping this ping that 
 everything seems good though 
 the network is <unk> not down 
 so i send him a remote app and take control of his laptop to see for myself 
 log into switches check things nope the network 's not down 
 when i log into the <unk> system though i see a big red error message : network error : can not connect to database '' 
 the database server is up though 
 i log into the database server windows server 2012 running <unk> and that 's where i find the problem : sql is n't running 
 i try to start it and it immediately shuts back off 
 now this is very bad for a couple of reasons 
 this server provides databases for a couple of very critical things in this plant 
 included are the plc systems which explains why the plant shut down - the plcs were n't running and the monitoring system had shut down the turbines 
 additionally this was not a problem with the network this was a problem with a server and we had subbed out the systems work to plc contractor so i had no idea how all this was supposed to function and no documentation on it 
 i 'm flying blind here 
 a couple of phone calls later i find out that plc contractor had subbed out procurement and set up of the server to incompetent morons who was on vacation 
 plc contractor does n't want to touch it tells me to call incompetent morons 
 <unk> 
 4 hours to shutdown and this has now become my multi-million dollar problem 
 back at the database server i start digging to find out why sql wo n't start 
 it did n't take me very long to find the problem : invalid license data 
 reinstall is required '' 
 turns out that incompetent morons had bought the appropriate licenses for sql 2012 but never bothered to retrieve or use the license key 
 the plant had been running on a trial install of sql this entire time and went down because the trial period ended 
 i wish i really wish i was making this up but i am not 
 of course i ca n't do anything to <unk> the integrity of the database including reinstalling and i do n't have the license key 
 the next hour or so consisted of lots of angry phone calls until someone at plc contractor finally dug up the documentation from the purchase and the hour after that consisted of roughly : 1 <unk> the ceo of an energy company incompetent morons put him down personally on all the microsoft paperwork to get into the msdn account incompetent morons had inexplicably set up in his name 
 2 find out that ms does not just give you a license key anyway it 's <unk> in the install disk 
 which means that incompetent morons actually bought sql and then proceeded to set it up using a trial copy 
 3 sweat bullets waiting for the install disk to download 
 4 <unk> license key from install disk 
 5 use procedure i discovered using the powers of google to update the license information without reinstalling 
 6 reboot everything sweat more bullets 
 after the database server was again serving databases the plc came back online and the techs were able to restart the turbines 
 we avoided shutdown by about 30 minutes 
 i took the rest of the day off 
 edit : <unk> not msdn 
 i had a brain <unk> <unk> i work in tech support for insert big computer manufacturer brand name here more specifically for their big business customers 
 which means that more often than not systems have either same day or next day onsite support when it comes to critical hardware failure 
 this one lazy thursday i was minding my own business at work probably browsing tfts when one of my coworker currently on vacation messages me over fb 
 more specifically he was still in the plane to his holiday destination : cw : my coworker he kinda looks like a <unk> or <unk> important to the story cw : lol this dude sitting next to me in the plane has the new insert brand new ultrabook model here but ca n't seem to get it past the bios splash screen '' quite unfortunate but not something we 've never seen before 
 most of the time it 's because of a bad bios or bad motherboard 
 in the end the same part 
 me at work to my cw : ok ask him for his serial number and contact information and i can book service for him directly so that we can get his system up and running before the weekend '' 
 in my mind i 'm thinking if this is n't the best customer service in the world then i do n't know anymore '' 
 so my cw asks the frustrated user for his serial number and explains to him that he works for the company and that that way we might get it fixed shortly after the plane lands already 
 the users reply to that 
 big computer manufacturer would never hire a kid like you they have professional men working in their departments 
 i do n't believe you really work for them '' flabbergasted by his comment my cw did n't reply back and told me to drop it all while the user packed his faulty system back in his bag in great frustration 
 we were the heroes he needed but not the one he deserved in the end 
 so i 'll keep this short as i 'm at work ... but this really <unk> me up earlier 
 i work for a company that manages networks for many different companies and businesses in our area 
 i was on a service call working away on one of the servers when one of the <unk> approached me 
 the custodian looked to be about 55 years old or so ... me : can i help you '' 
 custodian : yeah um ... i have a laptop here that i brought from home 
 it 's been having issues and wo n't start at all '' 
 me : okay can i look at it '' 
 i usually do n't do stuff on the side but i figured it would n't hurt to help 
 custodian : well i know you 're busy 
 are you sure you can '' 
 me : <unk> just bring it here i 'll see what i can do '' 
 about ten minutes later he shows up with a pretty new hp laptop 
 he tells me he just purchased the laptop about a year ago and the warranty was expired so he did n't know what to do 
 he then tells me he brought the laptop to a local computer shop and they said the motherboard was fried so he 'd be better off purchasing a new laptop 
 i tell him just let me look at it and he says he 's going to finish a job and to let him know when i was done 
 so out of interest i boot the laptop up 
 it shows bios screen beeps then restarts ... over and over 
 hmm ... i turn it over and open up his ram cover 
 i take out both sticks and put one back in trying each on individually to test them 
 lo and behold one of the ram sticks is bad and the computer boots fine with the second one i try 
 i actually had just ordered new ram for my own laptop and had the old ones in my car 
 i run out to the car and grab them and install them as well 
 boots up fine with two more gb 's of ram mind you 
 custodian comes back and i tell him what i did and let him know i put in two sticks of ram and he need not worry about it 
 the look on his face was <unk> ... he looked taken aback and i 'm not sure why 
 he then tells me he 's been using skype to chat with his son who is in the military and his grandson from across the country and would never have been able to afford a new laptop to continue the chats 
 he looked like he was going to hug me and had tears in his eyes when i let him know the computer was fine and i would n't be charging him 
 it 's like he never knew <unk> from another human 
 his voice was even a little choked up ... i hate seeing grown men cry cause i ca n't help but feel choked up as well 
 either way i sent him on his way and told him to let me know if any issues come up 
 makes me happy to be in this job ... tl dr : helped older man with laptop that was deemed dead to world '' bout made me cry when he told me what he used it <unk> & gt /u/bytewave : senior line this is bytewave you may assign me your tic ... '' i hear loud barking and someone screaming obscenities in the background 
 in addition to answering frontline calls for assistance road techs can also call us sometimes 
 they 're instructed to call frontline for basic questions but that they have our line for 'emergencies 
 someone took that a little too literally that day 
 & gt desperate subcontractor : yeah hey i 'm stuck up a ladder here 
 i 'm here to disconnect <unk> potentials 
 a guy is batshit crazy he does n't have a gun but his two huge dogs are down there 
 i 'm scared man '' 
 thing is they do n't have a direct number to reach us 
 they go through the call queue like any frontline agent ... & gt /u/bytewave : okay i assume you already called 911 ... '' ... i check the phone system - this guy waited <unk> seconds to talk to me* up his ladder sweating not counting the time spent in the menus 
 & gt desperate subcontractor : uhh no not yet but you 're the emergency line right '' 
 oh my <unk> <unk> 
 i 'm just speechless 
 & gt /u/bytewave : yeah for technical emergencies 
 but let me help you out here '' 
 i pull his <unk> as i conference him to a third line where i dial 911 
 & gt 911 operator : 911 what is the nature of your emergency '' 
 & gt /u/bytewave : i 'm calling on behalf of a road technician working for telco.ca current trapped up a ladder actively threatened by a man and two large dogs 
 as you can hear in the background we 're <unk> to his blackberry 
 address is 1234 main street he is working on our pmd up there in the backyard of a 16 units apartment building - clear access on both sides according to plans wider on east side 's parking lot 
 please note that the building is in a school zone since we are in school hours '' 
 & gt desperate subcontractor : uhh yeah - i could really use some help here '' 
 screaming and barking continues 
 & gt 911 operator : thank you for the details 
 we have a <unk> on the way i will stay with you sir ... not sure why we need a third party i 'll take it from here '' 
 & gt /u/bytewave : believe me third party does n't know either 
 i 'm leaving you two on i 'm sure everything will be okay '' 
 * ... i could n't resist ... * thank you for choosing senior line for your <unk> emergency '' 
 <unk> up* and i end it leaving them both connected 
 <unk> i <unk> his service call 's completion to read the resolution details 
 it read job complete but 911 <unk> necessary 
 contact supervisor for details '' 
 thank god the angry customer with <unk> analog did n't have a gun 
 seriously if they ever give you an in house line and tell you it 's for emergencies '' ... <unk> do n't mean this <unk> 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 short feel good story for a monday afternoon as i continue to dump old stories from my former career in university av support 
 i get an email from $ faculty way older and super nice guy who despite how smart he is really should have retired quite some time ago 
 he tells me that he 's having trouble getting a powerpoint of one of his <unk> to open 
 i help people plug in their flash drives and hit <unk> so naturally i 'm the powerpoint expert to everyone not our it help desk 
 i go through a few steps what version of powerpoint are you using 
 is the file extension .ppt or <unk> 
 did you enable a read only permission on the file ... '' 
 instead of an email i get a confused phone call back that does n't <unk> any results 
 he ca n't really even explain what the file is doing when he tries to open it 
 so like i said he 's a nice guy very few faculty are so i offer to go to his office on the other side of campus to take a look 
 get to his office 
 try to open the file i believe he was using a macbook and get an error that it ca n't find a program to open the file with 
 okay this i can work with 
 check to make sure powerpoint is actually installed 
 then i take a closer look at the finder window 
 there 's the file <unk> ... ** hang on what 's this <unk> doing there 
 all the other file names in the folder just end at .ppt i drag the <unk> bar over and reveal the remainder of the file name <unk> <unk> i 'm sorry to have to do this in an email but you <unk> answered any of our <unk> your mother and i feel its time you finally gave up this <unk> and came home ... ** i 'm <unk> the actual contents but he had somehow pasted a disapproving letter to his son after the file extension 
 what was he doing editing the file extension with a very personal email copied in his <unk> 
 we 'll never know 
 quickly deleted it before he realized just what he did replaced it with a .ppt and it worked 
 $ faculty was thrilled despite not actually realizing what happened 
 unless i 'm mistaken there is no known file association for <unk> disappointment 
 i work for a multinational manufacturing company and while most of our technology is <unk> and changed out frequently we have no need or desire to be <unk> <unk> 
 as such we tend to hang back a bit after big updates and wait for our various groups to thoroughly test the new update or os before doing a large scale <unk> 
 when the new ios 8 came out recently we decided it would be a good idea not to upgrade everything overnight because we do n't know how a new ios will work with our other systems on the corporate iphones 
 for example our mobile security program is specifically intended for ios <unk> because of this we sent out an email when ios 8 became available saying : & gt tomorrow <unk> <unk> apple will release the latest version of ios the operating system for iphones and <unk> 
 *our <unk> requires some time to test and <unk> ios 8 with our systems 
 & gt & gt **please do not upgrade any apple device until we have sent an updated communication and instructions 
 ** <unk> was in the original email as well & gt & gt thank you later that day i got a call from someone who said his iphone would n't send or receive email 
 he said i got that email from you guys that said to update to ios 8 i did and now it does n't work anymore '' 
 i asked him to check the email again and read it closely 
 oh ... '' i really wanted to say you did the thing 
 you did the very thing we said not to do 
 and you did it because we said not to do it '' 
 but i did not because i 'm nice 
 unfortunately there was n't anything i could do for him except send it to our ios guy as a test case for how to fix a problem like <unk> a woman in tech support often times you find yourself in unpleasant positions 
 there are some people who ca n't wrap their heads around the fact that in offices these days there are things that are no longer acceptable 
 for the guy in his <unk> who seems lost in the culture time forgot the idea of a woman shouting down the phone to a manufacturer about the 3 <unk> fault in the custom made new server rack that we ordered is almost too <unk> 
 such an individual will respond loudly with and what would you know about good racks <unk> '' 
 we had one of those here 
 he was a senior administrator in the department that deals with procurement and we know him as mr touchy 
 now mr touchy has no concept of personal space 
 no idea about inappropriate jokes and he frequently likes to give what we <unk> 'the reverse bear hug 
 we call it this because he comes up behind you and will wrap his arms around you <unk> your hands to your sides 
 he 's been in hr more times than i think the hr people have 
 it 's like his second home 
 however he 's the younger idiot brother of ceo and in his contract is a nice little handshake should he ever leave or be fired 
 every single human being in this building seems to hate him 
 a cleaner once told me that she would wipe neat solutions of various <unk> cleaning agents on the toilet seat in his office <unk> 
 just because she knew that the stuff would give you a <unk> unlike anything else if it contacted <unk> skin 
 thankfully he 's not down here very often and the last time he was in my neck of the <unk> an improperly fitted toner cartridge had <unk> leaked toner from my nose down and i was avoided to such an extent i 'm surprised that they did n't give me a bell to ring as i wandered round 
 on the fateful day in question we had a client onsite one of the junior network admins who was down to talk about an upgrade to their current setup 
 they wanted to come in and have a look at some of the higher spec machines we 'd be <unk> to them considering we were using them ourselves 
 for once the sales people were on the ball and decided that it might be able to answer some of their more technical questions about upgrading 
 absolutely no problem 
 so ms cleverclient was down with us having coffee while we drew up the details we had on file for her and the main <unk> we 'd expect with changing out the machines with her setup 
 it so happened that on this day mr touchy was down our way to argue with big boss about an order we 'd put in with procurement to purchase some extra licenses for the floor planning software the sales team used 
 he was n't aware we had a client on site and with looks of horror <unk> on the faces of those who spotted him he grabbed ms cleverclient from behind in one of his <unk> 
 all us women look the same it would seem 
 to which he received a <unk> which broke his nose and an elbow to the <unk> which cracked one of his <unk> 
 she then asked calmly if we could call the police 
 which we did immediately 
 mr touchy unfortunately was released with a caution 
 since our client chose to drop the charges in exchange for an 80 % discount on her purchases 
 the details of which were n't clear at the time 
 mr touchy was released from the company within two weeks and the hundred thousand handshake 
 well it turns out he never got it 
 it was absorbed to cover the practically free equipment we gave to ms cleverclient some clause about damages to the company in his contract 
 <unk> over something like assault is pretty costly it seems 
 ms cleverclient was one of the <unk> down at the local women 's <unk> group 
 tldr go figure <unk> exists 
 previous as i walked towards bigp’s office i clutched notie’s papers in my hands 
 i tossed up the decision in my head it seemed so obvious 
 the vp followed me into bigp’s office and stood staring at me 
 & gt bigp : ahhh so quick 
 the vp’s already told me he likes redcheer 
 & gt vp : but the <unk> comes down to you… the vp and bigp looked at me expectantly 
 the choice started <unk> my mind 
 & gt bigp : so <unk> you decided 
 who had i decided 
 the coffee in my hand told me to go for it 
 & gt me : we have to go with notie 
 he’s too qualified to let walk 
 the bigp’s face fell he looked rather shell shocked 
 & gt bigp : wha.. .. but.. 
 & gt me : he’s more qualified he’ll be an asset to the company 
 the vp’s face broadened into a smile 
 & gt bigp : i’ve <unk> & gt vp : he’s already hired redcheer 
 the vp was smiling insanely at this point 
 & gt me : … 
 but you said it was my choice 
 the vp took my shoulder and walked me out the door after leaving the office the vp turned to talk 
 & gt vp : oh airz 
 bad choice 
 & gt me : but… he was your candidate 
 the vp gave me a <unk> smile and walked off 
 i looked back into bigp’s office the bigp gave me a wave to come back into his office 
 i took a sip of my coffee 
 tasted like courage 
 i walked back into the bigp’s office 
 & gt bigp : you look … 
 angry 
 & gt me : you hired someone without even waiting for my opinion 
 bigp looked resigned 
 & gt bigp : didn’t you like redcheer 
 carefree told me you got on famously 
 & gt me : well she’s a nice lady but she’s basically an it intern 
 & gt bigp : i’m sure you can train her up 
 plus free employee 
 win for you whoever we hire 
 is it still a win if you don’t get who you want 
 i wondered as i walked away 
 next previous as the vp and i walked towards the bigp’s office i wondered why all big decisions at this company had to made so quickly 
 odd 
 actually screw it 
 i’m not <unk> this decision on guess work 
 & gt me : hey vp you go on ahead i just got ta check up on something 
 & gt vp : okay i’ll be in bigp 's come tell us when you’ve made up your mind 
 we’ll go tell the bigp your decision 
 the vp waved me off with a smile on his face weird 
 i looked down at notie’s <unk> in my hand 
 something at the very bottom caught my eye 
 two numbers 
 i can’t believe my luck he listed references 
 i picked up the phone 
 i wanted to see what other people have to say about notie 
 & gt *first <unk> - co-worker at notie’s <unk> employer 
 & gt me : hello this is airz calling about notie who recently had an interview with us 
 the voice that replied was deep and loud 
 i think he was shouting into the phone 
 & gt vloud : oh 
 notie 
 he got an interview then 
 & gt me : er.. yeah 
 i was just wondering what he was like as a coworker 
 <unk> tone went much <unk> basically whispering 
 & gt vloud : <unk> $ # 
 oh not a great start 
 vloud had paused as if considering his options 
 & gt vloud : i was hoping he would come back 
 he’s the only one here that knows everything 
 he pretty much holds this place together 
 & gt me : sorry come back 
 did… he leave 
 vloud started whispering even <unk> 
 i could hardly hear him at this point 
 & gt vloud : our f & amp # $ ing boss threw him out 
 what my idiot boss didn’t realise is he was the only one that knew about half the stuff here 
 we’re literally one screw up away from having to hire someone very expensive 
 son of a <unk> % $ boss doesn’t realise how much replacing notie is going to cost 
 & gt me : so he’s competent 
 & gt vloud : f @ # $ <unk> he’s competent 
 he’s a pretty cool guy to work with too after you get used to his sense of humour 
 i grabbed a pen off the desk in front of me and started clicking it i was getting nervous 
 & gt me : anything else i should know about notie 
 & gt vloud : er… if you’re serious about hiring him 
 don’t make him mad 
 & gt me : wha… er.. what happens if you make him mad 
 & gt vloud : oh 
 ummm 
 nothing 
 i just… er 
 he’s just a really good candidate 
 i looked at the pen in my hand i wrote **angry 
 ** down on the paper in front of me 
 & gt me : i see 
 & gt vloud : c $ # p okay look pretend i didn’t say anything 
 i just said it because i want him back here 
 i wasn’t thinking 
 it was a stupid thing to say 
 i started clicking my pen again 
 nervousness had just increased by a factor of two 
 & gt vloud : oh darn it 
 i hear clicking 
 that better not be hard drive failure 
 as i opened my mouth to tell him it was my pen i heard a crash on the other end of the phone 
 & gt vloud : okay … not great 
 i have an emergency over here 
 <unk> hire notie he’s a great guy who deserves a good job without a f* % $ ing retarded upper management 
 vloud 's voice was barely even audible 
 he was speaking so softly *click* vloud had hung up the phone 
 next my job is to get the product '' the company '' makes connected to the internet 
 one day i had someone call in 
 & gt user : my product '' wo n't connect to the internet 
 i want to use it to use internet service '' 
 & gt me : ok i can help you out with that 
 who is your isp 
 & gt user : what is an isp 
 this is n't usually a bad sign as a lot of <unk> that call do n't know this information 
 & gt me : you know the company you pay to get internet service 
 here are some examples list of isp examples '' & gt user : no i do n't have the money for those monthly fees 
 i just bought a router 
 that will give me free wifi 
 at this point i face palm so hard my coworkers were concerned i might have a <unk> 
 it left a red mark on my forehead 
 after a few minutes of silence 
 & gt me : sir ... that is not how routers work 
 you need to first pay an isp to get internet service 
 a router by itself will not give you free wifi 
 & gt user : you 're lying to me 
 the person at the store said if i got this i can connect product '' online 
 i demand to speak to your supervisor 
 & gt me : ok transferring you now ... but he 's just going to tell you the exact same thing ... an hour later at the end of my shift my supervisor comes to my desk <unk> a nice red mark on his forehead that matched mine 
 & gt supervisor : i just spent 45 minutes trying to convince user that a router does n't provide free wifi without paying for access to the internet 
 he still does n't believe me 
 i gave up and just hung up on him 
 let 's go get a drink ... i really need it after that ... edit : <unk> not <unk> 
 my head hurts leave me alone 
 the following morning i waited at my desk <unk> for a showdown with angie 
 roland <unk> and <unk> loudly as he worked on some <unk> task 
 angie fresh starbucks cup in hand barely made eye contact as she approached the its area 
 my opportunity to loudly demand satisfaction was at hand 
 as she placed her cup on the desk i armed myself with a copy of her project plan 
 i stood up to <unk> remove my glove to slap angie’s face with it 
 just as i began talking i was stopped in my tracks as angie barked into gear 
 her <unk> <unk> my <unk> with a <unk> whine “why hasn’t hr <unk> machine been replaced ” she demanded 
 i defended with “there’s nothing wrong with her machine at all it’s barely a year old and is one of the highest spec machines we have deployed 
 anyway <unk> angie dismissed my <unk> with a <unk> faced <unk> 
 “i want that machine replaced before you go to lunch today 
 reopen that ticket and get it done ” still brandishing angie’s project document she retrieved her cup and stormed towards the lair located somewhere beyond the dimly lit corridor which had seen many an engineer walk to their <unk> 
 i was left <unk> the <unk> won before i had even drawn my weapon 
 the emptiness of bhit’s desk offered no sanctuary in this moment 
 i left the project plan on my desk <unk> away towards the it cupboard to furnish hr tank with a new optiplex 
 after <unk> yet another <unk> session of unintelligent questions garbled half chewed up and spat back out by the hr tank i escaped her deskside with her old machine and yet another list of demands she felt inhibited her capacity to perform as she otherwise would 
 at the top of the list she required a colour printer placed near her desk 
 i guess having to walk half way across the floor to the <unk> printer may have burned vital <unk> necessary to plug the <unk> offered by her <unk> wide <unk> 
 in reality i was aware through the rumour <unk> that an apprentice she had <unk> in the guise of being <unk> in all manner of hr and legal duties had left some weeks prior citing the need for an actual career 
 hr tank had instead used her as a <unk> to fetch printer output deliver files to various unsuspecting recipients and on the way back from such <unk> <unk> various canteen supplies for her 
 this <unk> diversion of angie’s insistence became all too clear 
 bhit had finally gotten word of what had happened last night – most likely the tip off was my email sent to him just prior to my leaving which complained <unk> about angie’s actions 
 it seemed he had grown an impromptu pair of balls and demanded angie’s explanation via email – which of course angie was all too eager to give 
 remember this power woman had a <unk> experience of <unk> plotting her rise to the top 
 attached to angie’s response was yet a new project plan now detailing my <unk> responsibilities as technical delivery engineer 
 what’s more the handover of machines would <unk> be carried out at the conference instead all machines would ship next week directly to their recipients 
 this <unk> has been given the eager thumbs up by all middle management who welcomed the fact that angie would deliver the project apparently ahead of time 
 opening the pdf i <unk> down to the procurement section only to validate what i fully expected to see anyway 
 against the <unk> background of the branded company document my <unk> proposal had been replaced by a single line <unk> machines to be ordered from <unk> 
 the statement rubber stamped by all and necessary seemed to <unk> angie completely 
 the ball it seemed had bounced <unk> into my back yard 
 bhit rushed to my desk 
 i knew what he was going to ask before he’d even asked it 
 even though roland angie’s eyes and ears sat in close proximity i let my true feelings known to bhit 
 “so you’re telling me there is one week to image 250 odd machines 
 so in reality that’s 50 machines per day ” bhit nodded hoping i would <unk> and provide some magical way out of this new found emergency 
 “this is stupid 
 whoever planned this needs their ass handed to them ” my claim had now <unk> the attention of the rest of its no longer were their eyes <unk> on their screens scared to move 
 they were intently watching the spectacle as it unfolded in front of them 
 i turned to roland demanding “are the images even ready ” roland’s familiar <unk> vocal <unk> simply retorted with a shrug “the images are ready whenever you want them ” angie returned to its and immediately interjected my exchange with roland as if something deep inside her had fired up and <unk> into some sort of <unk> trait of a mother defending its young 
 she started “you told me it would take a week for the laptops to be imaged ” her obviously incorrect statement seemed a purposeful twist of words on my initial claim 
 “no 
 i said that each batch of 50 would take a week to build and qa ” <unk> my claims angie’s stern voice still sought to <unk> any offering of reality 
 delving deep into her pdf i demanded “why are we now <unk> the laptops out 
 why aren’t we delivering at the conference as planned 
 what about the 50 or so that are staying in the field that only need reimaging ” i felt confident - for once i felt that bhit had my back albeit ever so slightly <unk> by how easy he had <unk> <unk> in 
 angie’s <unk> answer seemed to be the line she had used to sell her project <unk> with “i will not disrupt an entire conference just to give out laptops 
 it is better to present the face of it by offering a support <unk> service as people need it instead of <unk> an entire event ” there was no way we could now argue this round now 
 angie had landed us in it 
 she had played her cards now it was an <unk> game of seeing where the chips would fall 
 bhit was powerless to do anything other than hope for a <unk> solution 
 angie was golden in the eyes of the upper management who had rubber stamped her new <unk> all the way 
 there was only one card left to play 
 i hadn’t expected things to go off to this magnitude – i was inexperienced in this sort of corporate <unk> 
 if i failed to deliver 250 built laptops angie could easily pass the buck down my name made <unk> with total disaster 
 if i delivered 250 built laptops angie would get the glory and i would remain a <unk> entity 
 for me neutrality or <unk> 
 for angie glory or neutrality 
 “i dunno how we’re going to do <unk> i said rising from my chair 
 leading the <unk> qbg followed closely behind me as roland wheeled the ghost server towards the it cupboard 
 bhit watched us disappear hoping we would indeed find this desperately needed magic <unk>

 pt18 : now that 's what i call a sticky situation sometimes fellow techs that makes you want to smash your keyboard 
 all names have been changed to protect the incompetent 
 i used to work in a <unk> capacity lovingly <unk> tier 1.9 where we would monitor ticket troubleshoot and escalate as needed we were expected to have a 90 % <unk> return 
 one thing that we never were allowed to touch was network issues 
 our area telcom team had lost their extremely competent team lead some 18 months earlier and their team had quickly degraded to people who did n't really seem to care about their job 
 they were also secure in the fact that the telcom system had degraded enough to be sufficiently obfuscated enough where it would take considerable resources to figure it out by a competent replacement 
 this made them act like they were <unk> 
 as such i had learned fast to start recording my phone calls to them thank you google voice 
 so they could n't pin anything on us 
 anyway one day around 6pm the network dropped out 
 as such i called the telcom on-call 
 **me leaving voicemail : ** hi this is craysh from tier <unk> it looks like the network is having issues again 
 internet communicator and email are all <unk> 
 all three <unk> are unavailable 
 trace route to the gateway has failed 
 ticket is unavailable as the ticketing system is <unk> due to the issue 
 please call back to confirm your taking ownership of the incident 
 15 minutes go by and <unk> dictates that i call back before escalating to their manager 
 the on-call answers 
 **tech : ** on-call phone this is steve **me : ** hi steve have you gotten my voicemail 
 we 're having issues with the network 
 **tech : ** no i have n't 
 tell me what 's wrong 
 **me : ** repeats what i said above 
 **tech : ** ok. wait 20 minutes and try again 
 *click* i had assumed that by <unk> 20 minutes he meant that he was taking a look at it and that it should be back up in 20 minutes 
 20 minutes go by and the network is still having issues the network has now been down for the last 40 minutes or so i call the on-call phone again 
 no answer 
 **me leaving voicemail : ** hi this is craysh again 
 the issue is still ongoing 
 please call me back as soon as possible 
 15 minutes go by so it 's time to call again 
 no answer 
 time to call the acting supervisor 
 **supervisor : ** this is aaron **me : ** hi aaron this is craysh from tier <unk> we are having issues with the network and the on-call has stopped answering their phone 
 **supervisor : ** stopped 
 you mean they initially answered 
 **me : ** yes he said to wait 20 minutes 
 **supervisor : ** ok he 's probably working on it 
 call me back in an hour if the issue persists 
 *click* at this point i 'm calling my supervisor and <unk> him of the situation 
 for the next hour i continue to call the on-call every 15 minutes as is procedure 
 no answer 
 i call the supervisor again **supervisor : ** this is aaron **me : ** hi aaron this is craysh from tier 1.9 again 
 we are still having issues with the network and the on-call still has not answered his phone 
 **supervisor : ** ok i 'll take a look at it 
 turns out that telcom had pushed a policy to the <unk> that had scrubbed the white lists completely blocking all access to all ports 
 all in all it took 5 hours to get everything back up and running 
 i documented the ticket extremely thoroughly once the system was available again 
 the next day came the <unk> 
 telcom was claiming that i had never paged them and they said that a customer ended calling the supervisor to find out what was going on 
 they even showed zero calls on their cellphone they had removed the calls and messages 
 as such we had a meeting to <unk> tier 1.9 's failure to report a severe incident 
 i walked into the room filled with extremely pissed off big wigs including aaron and and steve 
 they demanded why i had n't contacted the on-call and i stated that i had and that they had lead me to believe that they had been working on the issue 
 nobody believed me because the on-call phone did n't have any messages or call logs from tier 1.9 '' their excuse for having a completely empty call log was that they cleared it daily so they could keep track of the calls made on the phone 
 i calmly walked to the overhead projector logged into google voice and played each <unk> <unk> 
 they no longer work here and i 've had three promotions since 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - **edit : ** someone expressed an interest for the actual meeting 
 here goes : i was working the <unk> shift at the time and i had stayed an hour and a half late to <unk> the incident 
 a little after 8am i 'm woken up to be informed that there is a meeting i need to be at for 9am concerning the <unk> that tier 1.9 had alerting proper individuals in a high <unk> incident 
 running on 3 hours of sleep i usually went to bed around 5am and got up at <unk> i figured great 
 it 's about time telcom got <unk> for never answering their on-call phone '' 
 when i walked in to the meeting i pretty much knew that the telcom guys had decided to screw me 
 they would n't look me in the eye alarm bell one 
 we sat there while management had a little <unk> before hand outside the meeting room including the acting supervisor for telcom and i heard phrases like <unk> procedures obvious alarm bell two as i knew that they would not get rid of any telcom guys as of that point 
 my supervisor was not a part of this meeting he was sitting next to me alarm bell number three and he was pretty sure that they were planning on letting him go too 
 they came in the room and sat down quietly 
 they asked my supervisor if he had been <unk> of the situation last night and responded in the affirmative 
 we went over the procedure that i had followed and my supervisor acknowledged that i had called him and told him of the situation 
 they then asked telcom their version of events 
 they essentially said that i had never called the on-call phone and that the supervisor had been contacted by a customer <unk> of his who asked in passing why the internet was n't working 
 they took out the on-call blackberry and showed that there were zero calls and messages last night 
 the <unk> <unk> his cellphone that day so they could n't check his i so wanted to call his cellphone in the middle of the meeting and watch him explain that away 
 he was one of those people who had their blackberry attached at the hip 
 the <unk> officer 's technical representative or cotr came in to the room and he was fuming 
 asking me pointed questions and kept repeating 'why did n't you page out 
 and <unk> are procedures in place that you should have followed 
 i could n't get a word in edge wise and the telcom guys had very smug looks 
 i pretty much did n't care anymore at this point so instead of trying to explain further i stood up which pretty much made everyone <unk> up a bit and i walked calmly to the overhead projector 
 logged in turned on the screen and started playing the voicemails 
 nobody really said anything at first but the telcom guys definitely had priceless faces 
 the cotr told me 'please excuse us craysh 
 we have some business to discuss 
 feel free to take the rest of the day off with a $ 50 per <unk> 
 i think i ended up seeing <unk> of <unk> 
 my supervisor was told not to tell anyone what happened in that meeting after i left 
 all he would say was that they were very lucky that charges were not brought up against them since the documents that they filled out with the false information was a government document and what they did was technically fraud against the u.s. government 
 the only reason he told me this was because i had to help file an <unk> to the incident report 
 currently waiting for this persons pc to reboot 
 she 's having issues connecting to a remote server from home 
 shes on a vpn and its taking forever 
 servers pinging fine vpn is set correctly 
 then she says of course its set correctly its been on all night '' 
 i suggest a reboot and thats when she dropped the rebooting wo n't fix it 
 i never reboot my computer and it runs fine '' 
 line to me 
 she finally reboots and of course its fine now 
 if you’re not up to the interviews please go backwards : previous ***** as the red haired lady walked into the room and sat opposite i realized why i was forced into sitting on the same side of the desk as everyone else 
 interviews are always done across a desk 
 always 
 & gt bigp : welcome redcheer you’re here to interview for a position in it correct 
 redcheer looked nervously at the interview panel 
 she gave me a weak smile 
 & gt redcheer : yes 
 vp didn’t miss a step 
 he looked keen to get stuck into the interview 
 & gt vp : what’s your biggest <unk> 
 after an opening question like that i could tell he was out for blood 
 & gt redcheer : ummm… 
 probably it knowledge 
 i don’t know that much however i’m a fast <unk> 
 i would be willing to go on any it related courses to get my skills up to scratch 
 head of hr looked rather <unk> at the poor lady across the table 
 she glanced down the table at the vp and gave him a stern look 
 & gt headhr : sorry dear that was an awful opening question 
 how about you tell us a little about yourself and why you want to join our it staff 
 & gt redcheer : well i worked as a designer at carefree’s company but recently i’ve learnt i enjoy it related things 
 so i feel your company would be a good place for me 
 redcheer smiled at the interviewing panel 
 i looked over at everyone else in the room 
 bigp was smiling <unk> back vp looked calculating head of hr looked the <unk> and the company lawyer on the end just looked bored 
 i decided i’d go with a smile 
 & gt vp : why’d you leave design 
 & gt redcheer : i still like design its a part of me however i felt the need for a change 
 & gt vp : why though 
 vp looked very intently down at redcheer odd that he’d ask the same question twice 
 & gt redcheer : at my old company i had an <unk> and i felt if i didn’t leave… he would have 
 considering i’ve been thinking of a move to it it wouldn’t have been fair to not leave now… 
 redcheer seemed to realize at that point where she was perhaps sharing <unk> <unk> stories in a interview wasn’t a great plan 
 the vp however had a massive smile on his face 
 & gt vp : oh please… do go <unk> 
 head of hr snapped at the vp 
 & gt headhr : oh stop it vp 
 redcheer what it knowledge do you bring to the team 
 & gt redcheer : i know how to physically replace some parts on the computer 
 i can <unk> a pc 
 bigp and the head of hr nodded their heads <unk> 
 the vp however decided to strike 
 & gt vp : what server side knowledge do you have 
 redcheer looked very nervous at that question 
 i knew she had no knowledge at all in that area 
 & gt redcheer : i know that basics of databases and i know about html and <unk> <unk> on hard drives 
 i also know about server side upgrades and how sturdy racks are 
 other server knowledge includes safety when working in dangerous <unk> 
 and yeah… i realized she’d literally strung some words together and it vaguely made sense 
 i mean none of it was at all useful but the vp was still trying to work out what she’d even said 
 i decided to ask a question before he could counter 
 & gt me : hello again redcheer so why this company 
 & gt vp : again 
 wait airz have you met redcheer before 
 before i could open my mouth bigp answered for me 
 & gt bigp : no they’ve never met 
 the vp was giving me a suspicious face 
 & gt me : i haven’t ever seen redcheer <unk> before 
 in my mind that wasn’t a lie i had never before seen her specifically **here** 
 & gt headhr : okay 
 any questions you have for us redcheer 
 & gt redcheer : just one 
 if i worked here would i be working with airz 
 or are there multiple departments 
 & gt headhr : he’s the head of it so you’ll be working under him yes 
 redcheer smiled at that 
 then got up to leave 
 after she’d closed the door the vp erupted 
 & gt vp : we can’t hire that 
 she’s probably got kicked out of her last place of employment 
 i thought about speaking up but i was worried they’d ask me if i thought she seemed competent <unk> she seemed like a mess 
 & gt bigp : she’s the daughter of a friend 
 & gt vp : oh… 
 ….. … the vp took a minute to recover 
 & gt vp : still… we can’t hire her not until we’ve interviewed all the candidates 
 & gt bigp : redcheer is the only candidate 
 & gt vp : no no there is another 
 if the position is open and i’m paying for it… 
 its only fair if a candidate of my picking gets an interview 
 right 
 the vp looked over all the faces of the group 
 everyone wanted to say no 
 i didn’t have the <unk> my coffee had run out 
 & gt vp : good 
 i’ll schedule it for tomorrow morning 
 first thing 
 the vp smiled and left the room 
 bigp looked over at me and gave me a smile 
 he saw my worried expression & gt bigp : don’t worry airz either way… you get a new tech 
 next previous boredom 
 nothing was happening today 
 i guess this is what happens when everyone is mildly competent and looking out for any mistakes themselves instead of just leaving mistakes in a pile to <unk> on someone 
 i looked out over the tech area 
 everyone was hard at work kinda boring really 
 time for a ticket i thought to myself 
 but which ticket to take 
 i looked at the queue nothing jumped out 
 time for some ticket roulette 
 i closed my eyes and hammered the up and down <unk> on the keyboard until i couldn’t keep track of where in the queue i would be 
 i pressed enter and opened my eyes 
 new ticket & gt *could someone come upstairs and help <unk> some problems with the new <unk> - marketing dept walking up to the marketing department i remembered the desktops the vp had left in a pool of water 
 i wondered where these other <unk> <unk> came <unk> & gt markhead : airz 
 come see the new machines 
 & gt me : <unk> did you get them from 
 the ones ordered while i was away were wrecked 
 markhead smiled knowingly at me 
 & gt markhead : silence has its price 
 a high one actually 
 i looked at the desktops in front of me… they were mac’s 
 & gt me : woah 
 you managed to get these from <unk> vp 
 i stared at the silver <unk> before me 
 & gt markhead : they say its the fastest apple computer ever built 
 & gt me : so whats the problem 
 markhead looked a little sheepish for a moment 
 & gt markhead : you <unk> we love the look and feel of <unk> but.. we sorta <unk> all <unk> programs are in windows 
 sooo… 
 umm 
 markhead looked at me with a worried expression 
 i was still <unk> the <unk> passing off as personal computers 
 & gt markhead : any ideas 
 i stared hard into my soul 
 trying to think of a solution 
 & gt markhead : anything 
 & gt me : just one idea… 
 ***** the next day a whole shipment of computers arrived 
 marked as upgrades for it oddly they didn’t seem to ever get to the it department 
 & gt markhead : so these new <unk> will work with our existing software 
 & gt me : yep 
 markhead watched as one of the mac’s got taken into the lift 
 & gt markhead : and those mac’s go… 
 & gt me : mmm haven’t worked that out <unk> 
 & gt markhead : you sure its okay these new computers are coming outta your budget 
 <unk> face was filled with concern 
 i smiled back at him 
 & gt me : you let me worry about that 
 & gt markhead : thanks for keeping <unk> 
 & gt me : discretion has a <unk> i smiled at the head of the marketing department who in turn smiled back 
 & gt markhead : i owe you one 
 ***** as i got back to my office i saw a pile of brand new mac’s just sitting in the middle of the department 
 well… no use these going to waste 
 i looked around at the it department 
 & gt me : time for an upgrade anyone 
 apparently sometimes ticket roulette really pays off 
 next i hate heads of department meetings 
 everyone gets together to push an agenda and ignore everyone <unk> 
 the secretary <unk> her head in the door 
 & gt sec : tea anyone 
 & gt me : i’ll take a coffee 
 & gt sec : only tea in these meetings i’m afraid 
 coffee leaves the china with marks 
 i get my tea 
 the fancy cup and <unk> looking so floral 
 i regret the tea 
 i take a sip 
 tastes like bad water 
 the vp comes into the room to start the meeting 
 & gt vp : so to start i’d like to congratulate <unk> on becoming the new head of security and it 
 & gt me : temporary head 
 & gt vp : its a big plate to handle so hows the budget looking for this quarter 
 i sit back in my chair 
 i smile 
 & gt me : this quarter the it budget still has some spending room we’re asking for zero additional funds & gt at this time 
 & gt vp : excellent and even with the purchase of the new radios for security see guys this is how to run & gt a department <unk> 
 & gt me : wait what 
 i didn’t order any new radios for security & gt vp : oh i know i got my secretary to order them i knew how much you had on your plate 
 i 'm surprised the it budget to stretch that far though perhaps we’re giving you guys too much money 
 & gt me : the <unk> are coming out of the it budget 
 & gt vp : well you are the head of department… 
 & gt me : can’t it come out of the security budget 
 & gt vp : they don’t actually have one 
 not to worry you manage both in one budget that 's efficient 
 its why we promoted you no additional funds and you still manage to get new equipment 
 & gt me : how much was the new equipment 
 i look down at my floral cup 
 its pretty patterns do not mirror the thoughts going through my mind 
 i take a sip 
 i try to swallow all the rage building up 
 & gt vp : about $ 3000 i think 
 & gt me : i think ill need additional funds to cover something that large 
 & gt vp : you don’t need any more funds you said so before 
 & gt me : that was before i took a 3000 hit 
 & gt vp : i know ... but you’ll find a way to <unk> it in 
 i pick up the tea cup 
 i take a sip 
 still tastes like bad water 
 next old stories one two three four five six i graciously admitted defeat in the face of managerial apathy 
 i accepted my <unk> responsibility as i set about my regular duties visiting desk sides and dealing with the various whims and <unk> of the user base 
 in one way it was a relief to detach myself from any view of the <unk> turning <unk> of the rollout 
 i <unk> myself in some other issues which had come to plague the user base most notably a problem visiting reps had experienced with their laptops and smartphones failing to maintain a stable wifi connection in the office 
 i made my way past some familiar faces as i strolled around <unk> laptop in hand waiting to catch the moment when the wi-fi would drop 
 just as the signal dropped my investigation was put on hold as one of the sales managers caught my attention 
 his artificially <unk> teeth seemed to surrender every line of <unk> under the light as he smiled his <unk> salesman smile 
 as he casually enquired about the rollout i <unk> his attention towards angie as the new <unk> person 
 i was only in a consultant capacity as needed 
 his smile took on a slightly apprehensive expression i knew full well that bhit had <unk> my <unk> right from the start 
 to hear this dramatic change in events appeared disturbing 
 maintaining a professional demeanour i simply assured him of my belief that the project was in capable <unk> the first time i’ve ever flat out lied on the job 
 he disappeared back into the <unk> and <unk> of the office leaving me to my wifi investigation 
 an oddly <unk> wednesday afternoon surged into view 
 its felt clean and clear 
 we could at long last breathe a <unk> sigh of relief 
 angie and roland had disappeared off for what seemed like ages 
 the absence of their black <unk> had left a <unk> <unk> vibe like we had all just <unk> from some colossal ocean depth finally able to drink in some of the <unk> fresh air 
 its taste was like a cool breeze amidst some arid summer heat wave 
 it was a relief to actually hear our own voices again 
 the drone of <unk> chatter from the finance wenches had been the only <unk> <unk> of recent days 
 their <unk> discussions on male pop <unk> 20 years their junior various coffee <unk> and deeply particular insights of certain male employees that these aging <unk> women found attractive made for a <unk> <unk> the only moments of reprieve as angie’s led her menopause group for their <unk> starbucks fix 
 of course she would leave roland on <unk> duty 
 still we now had an opportunity to let our guards down 
 with a secretive half vocal whisper qbg was eager to catch up on the latest <unk> 
 her face <unk> in disbelief as i <unk> angie’s actions 
 i was just barely loud enough to be heard outside our conversation but just loud enough so to ensure bhit was in earshot 
 he barely <unk> while i concluded my full update to qbg 
 in one way i didn’t care who heard me anymore so long as bhit did 
 but it felt good to get listened to as if my account needed to be heard by someone 
 “there’s only a month to go… shouldn’t something more be happening by now ” as the week <unk> towards its <unk> angie and roland made frequent trips to the higher floors for rollout meetings as its <unk> away in their duties 
 i waited for <unk> requests from roland sometimes even <unk> <unk> him to check anything he wanted with me through as an agreeable manner as i could muster 
 roland refused to ask for help but in reality i think i was happier without having to endure this <unk> attitude and negative manner 
 my working life seemed basic and simple again just the way i like it 
 well of course with the regular <unk> of angie 
 morale was long gone but there were our own little private <unk> to disappear of to 
 the biggest <unk> was the ghost server that mafg and i had acquired built loved and later <unk> rescued from its janitorial doom 
 it stood <unk> next to roland’s desk – the three-item to a desk rule apparently mute given roland’s status 
 it was now clearly being held prisoner like a hostage whose <unk> had broken them down <unk> with their <unk> and taking on a new <unk> to mirror the evil twisted nature of its <unk> 
 the beige box was coated in the <unk> <unk> and goo that <unk> from roland’s skin like <unk> evil <unk> shooting <unk> goo from his palms 
 the <unk> label which had so proudly identified the ghost server by its hostname <unk> had been <unk> removed as if to <unk> some evidence of its history 
 it left a white <unk> obvious against its discoloured skin with scratches and <unk> surrounding it akin to an <unk> <unk> 
 two weeks passed by all news of the rollout went <unk> 
 roland appeared to be busily <unk> in another part of the building – we were quite happy to be relieved of angie’s <unk> 
 monday morning i was training <unk> in the fine art of replacing an old <unk> pentium 133 motherboard in an desktop that she had retrieved from a research department 
 a <unk> <unk> bell from the rear of the it cupboard had already been <unk> for some other parts previously its casing battered and bent 
 however luckily an entire motherboard and cpu remained 
 it was this we were <unk> to the distressed research machine its rare and irreplaceable <unk> commanding the utmost care and attention 
 the <unk> wrist bands seemed to complicate the procedure as its <unk> <unk> <unk> on various parts of the metal chassis 
 we were happily <unk> in our moment of isolation catching up on each <unk> <unk> it had been the first time i had been able to relax with someone at work for a while qbg it seemed could make a suitable replacement for mafg 
 our mother’s meeting was almost at a close when our a <unk> faced facilities monkey clad in dirty green jumper which seemed to evidence hard toil appeared in the doorway with an aged disapproving look 
 <unk> ” he mumbled 
 “there’s a truck turned up with loads of laptops 
 where are we meant to put ‘em ” his manchester accent echoed from the hallway through the opened it cupboard door his frame slightly <unk> the overhead lighting 
 his accent clearly demonstrated the fact that he was far from home like a lone <unk> holding his own in some foreign land 
 <unk> here i guess there’s some space at the back ” i said motioning to an <unk> mafg had previously emptied towards the end of his tenure 
 his <unk> smile accompanied the shake of his head “what all of <unk> 
 you know there’s about 250 of the things ” <unk> to the scene of the crime the facilities monkey purposely shuffled me towards the <unk> <unk> that had arrived in the yard standing like a <unk> battle tank just returned from war 
 its rear doors were flung open to reveal box after box after box adorned with the familiar dell logos as a team of facilities workers scrambled to <unk> them 
 “you better figure out where we’re going to put these double <unk> he <unk> thrusting a <unk> into my hands 
 i could see my name <unk> firmly at the top of the <unk> recipient list 
 i knew right then that my evening had just been <unk> by <unk> administrative oversight had caused this turn of events 
 of course i knew full well it had to be only one <unk> doing 
 the lobby of the building was decorated with an oversized clock face which hung above the main security desk 
 its appearance had a <unk> corporate <unk> 
 on the one hand <unk> would be impressed with such a bold <unk> statement 
 on the other it reinforced to any <unk> employee that they had been caught <unk> their arrival time electronically indelibly stamped on their permanent record as they would swipe their access cards 
 to add to this crafty corporate purpose this oversized clock always seemed to be a few <unk> minutes faster than almost any other clock that existed 
 tonight it took on a new role 
 it sarcastically <unk> my rapidly <unk> evening as i walked <unk> after <unk> of dell branded boxes to their temporary homes 
 neither angie or bhit were anywhere in sight to <unk> the situation 
 repeated <unk> to helpdesk to locate their whereabouts went <unk> 
 in the end some sympathetic facilities manager had yielded to my <unk> and offered three temporary rooms to hold the laptops 
 these were now crammed floor to ceiling with dell boxes 
 my clothes smelled old from my efforts <unk> with <unk> and the stale smelling air of the rooms i had been <unk> which had sat unused for some time 
 i packed away the last box finally leaving the building at 9pm 
 my <unk> from the project as prescribed by angie seemed to have been suddenly and <unk> <unk> in this single dramatic move 
 i had clearly stated in my project plan that these deliveries should be <unk> in batches of 50 at a time we didn’t have the space to deal with 250 machines – as this very evening would <unk> 
 this detail i’m sure had made it into angie’s rewrite of my project plan in verbatim 
 i know i had even seen it 
 what’s more with only two weeks to go building 250 machines in that time was no mean <unk> 
 what had roland even been doing this whole time 
 this blunder which felt a little too obvious seemed to <unk> stage two of angie’s sabotage

 previous & gt vp : airz 
 come up to my office i need to borrow a laptop 
 i looked down at the loaner laptop pile 
 one was left 
 i smiled as i picked it up 
 it was the worst laptop we own not by specs just by smell 
 as i walked up to the vp’s office <unk> laptop in hand i thought of all the time i’d wasted attempting to clean off the smell 
 days of my life down the drain 
 entering the office i handed off the laptop to the vp & gt me : last one left … 
 lucky 
 & gt vp : actually sit down airz i need to introduce you to our new business consultant 
 i looked at the lady to the vp’s left 
 she looked at me and smiled 
 & gt con : hello i’m business consultant 
 here to make everything run as smooth as silk 
 & gt me : oh pleased to meet you 
 good luck with the … <unk> 
 & gt con : hahaha a humorous manager 
 how … rare 
 the vp looked up at me he looked odd 
 oddly happy 
 & gt vp : i think we’ll send business consultant down to you first 
 & gt me : sorry what 
 & gt vp : business consultant will spend a little while down in it just trying to improve things 
 & gt me : improve things 
 everything is <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 & gt con : <unk> nice 
 does everything tie up so nicely with you 
 she gave me a broad smile 
 i didn’t bother to acknowledge it 
 i was on a war path 
 & gt me : we’ve a 100 % <unk> everyone has a working computer… & gt vp : don’t worry i know you’re a team player 
 & gt me : name one thing that we could improve on 
 challenge laid down 
 i stared down at the vp his mind was searching and finding nothing 
 i smiled a <unk> trap 
 & gt con : certainly seems like you can handle the hardware side of things what about the <unk> relationship 
 surprise attack side <unk> by the female <unk> in the room 
 & gt me : we’ve a great relationship 
 & gt con : not yet we don’t 
 i looked down at the table searching for coffee to double check i wasn’t hearing things but no coffee was around 
 & gt me : sorry 
 & gt con : well have you got a review system in place 
 for feedback after tickets are completed 
 & gt me : errr… the vp’s eyes lit up his mouth started to work again 
 & gt vp : yes 
 a review system 
 for example i’d give you a 1 out of 10 for this laptop loan 
 it smells like… 
 & gt me : its the last laptop we have i’m afraid 
 plus you made it like that… & gt con : don’t worry airz it’ll be fun looking at the business in different ways together 
 i looked over at the vp i smelt something <unk> it wasn’t just the laptop 
 & gt me : errr do you want a copy of my protests in writing now… 
 or should i just skip a step and shred them 
 the vp looked at me his eye’s <unk> me to continue 
 & gt con : hahaha 
 don’t worry vp he’s a funny one 
 i think consulting will go fine 
 & gt vp : i don’t think that was a joke i 'm not happy with employees speaking to me like that 
 & gt con : oh good 
 you can write that in the review when it gets implemented 
 & gt vp : oh yes 
 the review 
 the vp smiled 
 his smile was wide 
 i felt a <unk> 
 danger was on the horizon 
 i just could n't quite make out how much 
 next i teach cle continuing legal education classes on lawyers and information security from time to time 
 i enjoy teaching and get credit for the classes 
 theoretically there’s a chance at business development as well but that’s a mixed bag 
 this is one of those stories 
 i’m sitting in my office doing some administrative work while waiting for a conference call with a customer to start 
 my cell phone rings with a local number that i don’t recognize 
 unknown caller : <unk> 
 is this lawtechie 
 did you teach a cle on security ” me : ”er probably 
 why ” unknown caller : <unk> have that file scrambling virus 
 john said you’d be able to help <unk> me : ”i don’t know which john you’re talking about.” unknown caller : <unk> is one of my <unk> 
 he took your <unk> me : <unk> for him 
 look 
 i’m up against a deadline today 
 i could talk to your it people tomorrow and walk you through your <unk> unknown caller : <unk> no 
 this is an emergency 
 all of our files are <unk> me starting to think that unknown <unk> voice is familiar but i can’t place it : ”well if you want me to drop everything that’s an emergency rate and we’re not <unk> unknown caller : ”i was thinking you would do this as a professional courtesy 
 we don’t have an it person so we’re flying <unk> me : ”i see 
 you want me to drop my paying customers to help you because we’re both lawyers right ” unknown caller : ”well you should have a good reputation among your fellow <unk> i think i know who this person is 
 i’ve got a grin 
 me : ”i think we may have met in the past 
 about six years ago did you have a client named $ oddball_client_name in a contract dispute ” unknown caller : <unk> 
 $ oddball_client_name has been a client for years 
 why ” me : ”i thought i recognized your voice 
 back then i tried resolving a dispute and you threatened me with sanctions even after i granted you two <unk> unknown caller : ”so are you willing to help me ” me : <unk> a professional courtesy ” unknown caller : <unk> me : <unk> 
 i’ve got your professional courtesy right here 
 figure it out <unk> my grandmother called me at work to day to tell me : & gt '' my do n't touch has a 9 on it '' this is the screen shot i got her to send me i intentionally created do n't touch '' for all the standard ipad apps that she found confusing stock market <unk> <unk> etc ... turns out she dragged one of her slot machine games in there and it 's been accumulating notifications for a few days 
 not really much of a tech support problem but it was pretty funny when she called me and said my do n't touch has a 9 on it '' i 'm proud of her 
 she did n't touch it 
 i did n't realize just how much i 'd thrown myself into work since my <unk> left me 
 i 've been closing 600+ tickets a month since march plus all my projects and emergencies 
 the next closest person is <unk> about 275 or so a month 
 the bosses have said the number of tickets i do is too damn high 
 - - - - - <unk> jack and <unk> <unk> <unk> - present - i will find you hr will end you and i will laugh - - - - - 13 june <unk> a friday to end all fridays that one was 
 my boss / coworker and i were dealing with daily tasks he was working on an exchange migration for a new client and i was busy making up for the slack our <unk> tier 1 and 2 helldesk operators were leaving between the two of them that day they closed 33 incidents i closed <unk> on my own thanks to the power of the contents of my desk - <unk> eat your heart out plus working on our barracuda 's spam filters and setting up a few allowed senders on it 
 hey $ boss '' i said spinning in my swivel chair towards him 
 we got a problem 
 cryptowall e-mails got through the spam filter today '' 
 he did n't look over 
 when and to whom '' 
 a few hours ago and to some of our most <unk> stupid clients '' i retorted flipping my <unk> monitor to him and pressing <unk> a few times to increase the font size in the rather long list of e-mail recipients who 'd gotten the spam 
 sure enough his eyes widened and he expressed his displeasure with a string of expletives that called the company 's owner in from his corner office behind the wall next to him 
 send out an e-mail instructing people not to open that to the admins at each company - let me stop you <unk> there boss 
 not only did i just do that but i added it to the blacklist in the barracuda and i 'm remoted into the most critical clients boxes as well as their replay servers just in case someone opens one of the links - as i said this i noticed the newly opened open files '' section from computer management in one of our bigger also quite <unk> lacking in common sense and <unk> rich clients <unk> / dc was flickering quickly enough to give an <unk> a seizure 
 with a smirk i looked up the machine that that user was connecting from and remotely ipconfig <unk> 'd it 
 the flickering slowed and stopped and i shrugged 
 problem half solved 
 get $ <unk> over there and let 's have him clean up that machine 
 i do n't want it on the network until it 's clean properly '' 
 sure enough a few minutes later the users who 'd been accessing files in that server called and stated that they 'd been corrupted 
 we loaded up replay mounted the restore point and started copying back the corrupted data from the backup 
 the restore completed successfully we turned back to our machines and continued working 
 a mere half-hour later the phone on my boss 's desk rang and the caller was from that company 
 uh the files are still corrupt '' 
 that 's odd 
 we restored them from backup 
 let me look ... '' i flipped open the open files window which had been behind a bunch of other rdp sessions and blinked in astonishment 
 another user had opened the same e-mail and this had <unk> the shares we 'd restored and to an even worse degree 
 i kicked that user off the network and phoned $ <unk> with strict instructions to ban both users from the network until further notice 
 at the same time i started composing a new e-mail to that site 's admin and forced a new <unk> on then psexec 'd a <unk> <unk> to every machine on the domain 
 jack i do n't get it 
 the admin forwarded your e-mail to everyone here saying not to open the e-mail and the second user said it was a legitimate accident that she opened it 
 she thought it was something she expected from a legitimate dropbox user '' 
 i do n't care 
 normally i 'd make sure they 're canned ... but <unk> <unk> my coffee this morning so i 'll be okay '' 
 i locked the users out of ad then over the next hour i not only restored their data but sent out an e-mail to everyone at that site from our administrative account stating that under no circumstances were they to open that e-mail or anything like it 
 if they were in doubt they were to call me immediately on my desk line and i would work with them to make sure it was safe 
 i stated that two people had already infected their machines that day and while i can understand one or two a third would result in immediate hr <unk> for disciplinary action 
 i left the office that day drove home in rush hour traffic and <unk> heat and proceeded to down a bottle of <unk> then passed out 
 saturday morning i woke up to my phone ringing just after seven am 
 the answering service put a call through to my cellphone despite my explicit instructions not to - and me not being on call - and i made it <unk> clear there would be retribution on monday when i talked to my boss before talking to the client on the other end 
 none of our files are opening '' the woman on the other end said 
 we thought you cleaned this up yesterday '' 
 we did '' i grumbled falling out of bed and stumbling to my home office through only a mild hangover 
 let 's see what 's going on '' 
 i pulled up my remote access console then remoted into their file server 
 sure enough every file on all but two of the shares was encrypted 
 i politely excused myself then tapped mute on my cell and started swearing like mad 
 i pulled up the properties of the file and then the details tab showed me the owner ... at which point my eyes opened a bit wider 
 let me call you right back '' i said firing up outlook and my <unk> on my desktop 
 after looking in a folder to verify the information i wanted was there i activated the <unk> feature then dialed the woman who called me back 
 so 
 you 're right the files are encrypted 
 apparently a third person infected their machine with cryptowall after we cleaned everything up 
 they did so by opening the e-mail after we told them to ... a good hour after we told them not to and after not one but two e-mails were sent out to warn people about this and from the look of the ntfs metadata that person was you '' 
 no one ever sent me any e-mail '' 
 let me stop you <unk> there '' i said flipping open outlook again 
 i 've got two read receipts here both timestamped that said you read the e-mails 
 one that the admin sent out one that i personally sent out 
 you opened the e-mail afterwards and then opened the infector on your machine ... at ... '' i remoted to her machine and found the infector file which indicated it had been running for just over 12 hours 
 <unk> pm '' 
 um ... '' so i 'm going to do a few things here '' i <unk> through the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the slight hangover i had as i locked her ad account and rebooted her machine which she 'd been remoted into with logmein 
 i 'm going to pull the list of files you 've destroyed i 'm going to make an estimate on the time the restore 's going to take i 'm going to kick off the restore and then i 'm going to <unk> my boss your boss your head of hr and give them the information i 've found which clearly states that you did it '' 
 sure i opened the e-mail but i did n't break the files and you ca n't prove it '' 
 well the ntfs metadata will prove you did but this call 's recording will do the job just as well '' 
 i smirked 
 texas is a <unk> state you realize - and this call may be recorded for quality of service '' 
 she hung up i started the restore and i e-mailed the <unk> file of the recording to the three people i said i would then went back to bed and <unk> for a few more hours 
 - - - - - tl dr : you 're once twice three times an end-user 
 - - - - - everything else i 've done is here 
 enjoy 
 this is a bit of a long one but believe me it 's worth it 
 i 'm in the it department for a mid-sized utility company 
 we 're a small department of three a coworker the it director and myself so we all wear a lot of <unk> 
 a year or two ago we installed a new voip phone system 
 one user in particular a secretary of sorts for the electrical department uses her phone <unk> constantly because of customer calls coming in and then making calls out to the crews 
 she has a wireless headpiece for her phone to ease the <unk> 
 she also has what might be <unk> called a brusque '' manner of speaking 
 about a year ago she called up our department with complaints that her phone was dropping calls '' 
 no problem we say we 'll check it out 
 there 's only a few things it could be right 
 i check the switch logs and see nothing suspicious in the port as far as errors dropped <unk> or anything like that 
 the config on the port also looks good 
 cable <unk> results look good for her connection 
 phone is still fairly new so we decide the most likely factor is a bad wireless headpiece since we 've had trouble with them before 
 we swap that out everything seems good for a short bit but soon she 's complaining again 
 we check all the same things again and this time decide maybe it is the phone itself 
 we 've got spares so we swap it out 
 every few weeks she calls up complaining and as you might guess try as we might literally nothing works 
 we run a new cable to her workstation 
 we move her to another switch 
 turn off <unk> on <unk> speeds replace the phone again 
 we finally feel like we 've isolated and done everything we could do 
 the only factor we have n't changed is the user herself 
 we all <unk> it up to her brusque '' attitude toward customers and assume that people are just hanging up on her 
 last week my coworker gets a call from the user 
 she explains that she 's determined the cause of her phone <unk> : every time she gets an email on her personal account on her iphone while talking on the phone the line goes dead 
 as soon as he can my coworker calls me up and we <unk> with laughter over the diagnostic 
 there 's literally no connection between the iphone and desk phone 
 we do n't even provide wifi for our users 
 if she 's getting data on her phone it 's her own personal mobile connection 
 we enjoy our chuckle and hang up not even bothering to investigate 
 later my boss comes by my office and while talking i tell him of the call 
 he has a good chuckle too and is about to <unk> it but then something makes him say : man would n't it be crazy if that was actually the problem '' 
 to which i reply yeah but obviously it 's not '' 
 but what if it was '' 
 so i <unk> what might be happening 
 maybe maybe somewhere the <unk> is off the cable and receiving the email makes the the iphone have a brief spike of <unk> interference that somehow momentarily <unk> the connection 
 but no it 's too <unk> 
 still my boss has got my interest <unk> and i decide to check it out 
 i <unk> up to her desk and tell her i want to check this out because it 's so crazy 
 i call her desk from my mobile phone and then have her send her personal email account a test message 
 the phone pings its notification noise to signal it 's got the email and <unk> of a <unk> if the line does n't go dead 
 i flip out but have enough presence of mind to see that the line has n't gone dead only become muted 
 my mind races then <unk> on a <unk> fact 
 did n't people used to <unk> phone systems by using specific frequencies 
 and that notification ringtone was pretty flat and electronic sounding ... change your notification ring 
 i have to check something out '' 
 i <unk> 
 we repeat the test and sure enough with the new notification ring the line stays connected and unmuted 
 somehow some freak chance of tech has matched some touch tone in our voip phone system to the exact same frequency on the user 's iphone and she was inadvertently phreaking her own phone to mute whenever she got an email 
 i admit the phreaking diagnosis might not be 100 % for sure and that it might be some kind of weird audio <unk> instead but there 's no denying the ringtone was causing her phone to mute 
 she 's not had any problems since 
 i <unk> admitted to the user that i had n't believed her and that this was one of the <unk> solutions to a problem i 've ever encountered in <unk> everybody 
 i 'm back on <unk> this week which mean that i had some downtime to browse some old tickets and chat logs 
 which led to me <unk> one of the more amusing requests that the internal it help desk has received : tonight 's cast : * steve : the head of it for site lingo 
 * william : internal it tech 
 used to work for steve directly before joining <unk> 
 -- -- incident : # <unk> from : steve site lingo message : left my pants at home 
 could you bring them to me 
 -- -- incident : # <unk> from : steve site lingo message : the black ones 
 -- -- incident : # <unk> from : steve site lingo message : they 're on a <unk> left hand side 
 -- -- my coworkers watched these messages come in with a mixture of <unk> and confusion 
 finally one of them could no longer resist the <unk> to respond 
 -- -- re : incident : # <unk> from : william internal it message : sorry boss but we do n't do pickup or delivery 
 -- -- turns out the messages were intended for his wife but the internal it desk was somehow being cced them 
 steve did n't realize that we were receiving the messages as well because he had long ago created an email filter to hide the you have created a ticket '' auto response that was sent out every time we got a new incident or request 
 how steve managed to include both our address and her address in the same message without realizing it though remains a mystery 
 more of my stories can be found here previous it was the start of my third day of my week off 
 i expelled the memory of what happened at the hospital from my mind 
 the jumpsuit from the previous day in hand i walked up to my temporary place of work 
 carefree was waiting for me as i entered the building 
 he gave me a huge smile 
 & gt carefree : thanks again for helping out redcheer 
 & gt me : oh no worries 
 i didn’t really have anything else to say after that so i just smiled and waited 
 & gt carefree : so about chasing those cables in the roof i don’t think you should go up there anymore 
 not after the accident <unk> & gt me : oh are you sure 
 i even brought the jumpsuit back 
 oddly i felt disappointed in not being able to go into the roof 
 it was something to do 
 & gt carefree : yeah i’m sure 
 don’t worry too much about the jumpsuit 
 he looked down at the jumpsuit in my hand 
 shock registered on his face 
 & gt carefree : wait… is that blood on the front of the jumpsuit 
 & gt me : haha oh that 
 luckily that 's just apple and black current juice 
 hospitals really don’t have the selection of drinks you’d expect 
 & gt carefree : oh 
 well anyway its probably for the best if you keep out of the <unk> i agreed so the conversation seemed to be over 
 i kept walking into the office 
 as i entered i was caught by one of the designers i hadn’t met before he was wearing a <unk> and had his hair <unk> just so 
 & gt scarfy : hey 
 are you the tech guy 
 & gt me : yeah that 's me 
 & gt scarfy : oh great just to make sure we’re on the <unk> page 
 whats your name 
 & gt me : airz 
 nice to meet you… 
 scarfy gave me a look as if expecting me to continue talking 
 eventually he just smiled 
 & gt scarfy : anyway airz i’ve been having trouble with this usb 
 could you come take a look at it with me please 
 & gt me : sure thing sorry i didn’t quite catch your <unk> & gt scarfy : oh don’t worry 
 everyone’s new to you we only have to learn one new name 
 we made our way over to his area and he showed me the usb in question 
 & gt me : this… is just a pile of broken chips 
 & gt scarfy : see airz i had a file on there and the usb stopped working yesterday 
 someone told me you could take out the memory parts and put them in another usb and it would start working 
 you weren’t here then so i thought i’d give that a try myself 
 i looked down at the remains of the usb 
 it looked like it had been hit with a hammer 
 repeatedly 
 & gt me : this is wrecked 
 & gt scarfy : but airz 
 i’ve got an important file on there 
 i looked at the chip carefully the memory seemed to be cracked 
 in about ten places 
 & gt me : no 
 no chance 
 i’m afraid this <unk> beyond repair 
 & gt scarfy : how long airz 
 & gt me : sorry 
 how long… 
 i gave him a confused face 
 the most confused face i could muster 
 & gt scarfy : how long would it take you to fix it 
 given no <unk> 
 & gt me : unlimited time and unlimited resources 
 still probably never gon na happen 
 & gt scarfy : come on airz 
 just give me a sensible amount of time 
 i seriously didn’t know what to say 
 it literally couldn’t be done 
 i don’t do magic 
 & gt me : okay fine 
 ten days and a mountain of cash 
 scarfy looked disappointed at that 
 & gt scarfy : oh airz not worth it 
 may as well just download it again 
 & gt me : sorry… download it 
 you mean you’ve got a backup of the files you want 
 a user that backed up his own files 
 i was internally jumping for joy 
 & gt scarfy : yeah 
 they’re online but the site is super slow it’ll take at least an hour 
 i stared down at the smashed usb on the desk in front of me 
 a smashed usb all to save an hour 
 & gt me : wait you said this broke yesterday 
 you could have just downloaded them last night 
 & gt scarfy : yeah that 's true airz but i thought you’d be able to just get them back on the <unk> i stared at this man waiting for him to realize how broken this usb truely was 
 nothing 
 & gt me : okay… well better get downloading 
 i wanted to add his name to my newly <unk> <unk> understand <unk> list i didn’t know his name though 
 & gt scarfy : thanks for trying anyway airz 
 & gt me : mmmm no worries 
 whats your name again sorry 
 & gt scarfy : haha i never told you remember 
 i thought about letting his name thing go 
 not today 
 & gt me : oh.. i have to know your name so i can put your name down when getting you a new usb 
 & gt scarfy : oh okay i’m scarfy 
 pleased to meet you airz 
 scarfy 
 the man who’d flood his home to get a jet <unk> out of his garage 
 next previous ***** please check out the comic of the last story here ***** as i get my office and i smile into my coffee 
 bigp was right a free employee i’m not paying for whats not to like 
 i’d been told redcheer was starting monday no one in it had been told yet about the new employee 
 i decided it was time to cheer everyone up 
 & gt me : everyone hey 
 the techs turned their heads from the computers 
 they didn’t look too hostile 
 & gt me : on monday we’re getting a new employee down in it 
 i smiled around the room to let everyone know i 'm pleased with this development 
 the smiles i received in reply <unk> me 
 & gt solitaire : oh excellent he can help us keep up with the christmas rush 
 & gt me : <unk> 
 and what christmas rush 
 i took a sip of coffee christmas was usually a quiet period 
 the word <unk> <unk> up the ears of the single men in the office as well as the pantsuit 
 & gt pantsuit : another woman is working the day <unk> 
 & gt me : yep 
 pantsuit looked pleased at this development she even did a small fist <unk> and mouthed “yes” which was odd 
 & gt solitaire : so what’s her specialty 
 & gt me : oh she’s quite new to it 
 the mood in the room dropped 
 like a brick 
 smiles where wiped off faces everywhere except pantsuit’s 
 & gt me : but.. but she’s a fast <unk> 
 <unk> be able to help in no time 
 & gt solitaire : well i’m not training her 
 looked what happened last time 
 as i looked back over at itsec i realized he hadn’t turned out that badly 
 even if the ticket <unk> almost took my head 
 still probably best not to repeat that way of teaching 
 & gt me : pantsuit you seem pretty pleased to get another woman to work with mind training redcheer a little 
 & gt pantsuit : wait ... redcheer… that’s her name 
 & gt me : yeah she’s pretty nice 
 pantsuit’s smile had gone she looked serious again 
 & gt pantsuit : no 
 sorry 
 i can’t train her 
 & gt me : but why 
 you’ll be a great teacher 
 & gt pantsuit : no 
 no i don’t think i want to teach <unk> i looked around the room no one seemed keen on wanting to teach a new person 
 i took a sip of coffee **just force someone to teach <unk> it screamed 
 i looked up from my coffee cup pantsuit was closest 
 and she never really had problems & gt me : pantsuit i’m afraid you’re going to have to teach her some <unk> & gt pantsuit : why 
 because i’m a woman 
 put the only two women together is that it 
 & gt me : <unk> wait… wha… 
 no 
 you realize there are lots of women in this office right 
 i 'm not putting the only two women together 
 colourblind looked between me and pantsuit 
 & gt colourblind : why don’t you do it airz 
 i wasn’t sure if he was saving me… or condemning me 
 & gt me : i’m too busy managing everything 
 can’t you do it 
 colourblind didn’t say anything he just looked annoyed 
 i looked around the room no one looked keen 
 & gt me : <unk> no one 
 & gt colourblind : no one can 
 its the christmas <unk> & gt me : what is the christmas rush 
 & gt colourblind : just… teach the new hire okay 
 i knew the christmas rush wasn’t a thing… but i couldn’t prove it and i had no coffee left 
 next **edit : sigh i could <unk> kill <unk> - & amp nbsp i’m a fairly new redditor and i’m still amazed of all the <unk> 
 of course there is a tales from tech support 
 a bit of background originally a software developer but after a year working for a small company right after my degree i realized that i would never be top <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> i hated the long long hours and unrealistic deadlines so when i got the opportunity 9 years ago to work as an it <unk> support i jumped ship and never looked back 
 i’m working at a big danish <unk> with <unk> users and computers and working both 1. and 2. line support <unk> <unk> have to save money hence the double job function 
 so this was a couple of years ago 
 i get a call from a user that can’t login to a new system that she and two <unk> have gotten access to 
 <unk> <unk> & gt **me : ** it this is <unk> & gt *user : * hi my boss sent an email explaining how to login to the new system with pictures and everything but i still can’t login 
 the login window is… like… 
 not responding 
 & gt **me : ** right what’s the name of the system 
 & gt *user : * <unk> 
 can you somehow see if my pw or username is wrong 
 & gt **me : ** tell you what let me just reset your pw and give you a standard one which you change when you enter the system 
 your pw is now <unk> 
 & gt *user : * <unk> 
 i can hear her tapping the keyboard nope sorry it doesn’t work & gt **me : ** are you sure it’s the right pw 
 don’t we all know… 
 <unk> is not on 
 remember the letter that was supposed to be capital 
 & gt *user : * yes 
 i’m sure 
 but something is weird about the login prompt 
 it is as if it’s frozen 
 you should fix it since you made it 
 tone of her voice is now annoyed & gt **me : ** we didn’t develop the system your department bought it without our consent and expected us to support it which we won’t 
 we will only help with pw resets the rest is up to your super users and the company you bought it from 
 & gt *user : * <unk> & gt **me : ** but since you are so sure about your pw i’ll just reset it again and make a new one 
 might be a delay from <unk> 
 the new pw is <unk> 
 & gt *user : * <unk> no sorry but it just doesn’t work 
 the login prompt wont allow me to enter anything 
 & gt **me : ** <unk> ok what’s your computer’s id number i’ll remote in 
 10 <unk> later i’m remote controlling her pc & gt *user : * see what i mean 
 i do everything i’m told in the email 
 & gt **me : ** <unk> & gt **me : ** you are trying to log into a screenshot 
 my last story was a bit of a <unk> so i thought i 'd share a good one 
 this one also takes place at the $ university 
 several years back i deployed new computers to the library with windows 7 on them 
 now most of the library staff took to the new os without issue as they 'd been using it at home for some time but one librarian - our head librarian - was still used to xp so the new os was a big <unk> for her 
 knowing this in advance i expected to receive some extra calls from her about basic usage items 
 *some* extra calls 
 instead over the next few weeks she inundated me with multiple calls daily with issues like how do i mute my speakers '' 
 or my screen is too dim '' 
 or why ca n't i find ms word 
 as you might guess some of the calls i received were actually related to the new os whereas the rest were unrelated but triggered by the upgrade because she did n't understand that windows does n't actually control things like the volume knob on her speakers 
 now ... $ headlibrarian hl is a friend who in spite of living in want of technical prowess is actually very intelligent willing to learn and very good at what she does 
 this i respect so i was happy to extend her extra patience as i never had to answer the same question twice 
 nevertheless after two weeks of calls my patience was beginning to <unk> and it occurred to me that most of her questions could be solved by a simple google search 
 so i decided on a new tactic the next time she called ... & gt me : lordpaddington here 
 hey $ headlibrarian what can i do for you 
 & gt hl : hi 
 i 'm wondering if you can help me with something i ca n't figure out how to set my email signature in outlook 
 i sighed a little 
 this is exactly the kind of <unk> question i 'd been getting from her since the upgrade 
 & gt me : you know $ headlibrarian this the kind of thing you could find out for yourself with a simple google search ... & gt hl : really 
 but it 's just so much easier to call you 
 & gt me : be that as it may looking this sort of thing up in google is the better way to go 
 now i 'm going to help you with this problem but the next time you call me with an issue like this if you have n't checked google first i will hang up on you 
 & gt hl : you would n't 
 *her tone was flat and clearly unimpressed 
 * & gt me : trust me $ headlibrarian i have no <unk> about <unk> out tough love i will hang up on you if i think it 's necessary 
 but never mind that here 's how you can update your signature 
 *i proceeded to walk her through updating her signature 
 * & gt me : there you go 
 pretty easy eh 
 & gt hl : thanks 
 & gt me : now remember next time be sure to look your issue up in google before calling me 
 & gt hl : okay 
 *i could tell by her tone that she did n't quite believe me 
 * fast forward a few days - the <unk> <unk> i go without hearing from her for a while and i 'm beginning to suspect my encouragement to use google might have actually worked 
 but the next call i got from her proved me wrong 
 & gt me : lordpaddington here 
 hey $ headlibrarian what can i do for you 
 & gt hl : hi lordpaddington 
 i did something to my speakers and they came unplugged 
 can you come fix it for me 
 & gt me : $ headlibrarian do you remember what i said to you about what would happen if you did n't check google before calling me about issues like this 
 & gt hl : you <unk> i hung up on her 
 it was <unk> of me and i felt awful doing it but it was the only way she was going to learn 
 30 seconds later she called back 
 & gt hl : you hung up on me 
 *she sounded offended but i think she was more shocked that i 'd actually done it 
 * & gt me : i told you i would 
 now did you check google 
 & gt hl : no 
 but i- i hung up on her again 
 this time i was sure she 'd be pissed 
 5 seconds later ... & gt hl : stop hanging up on me 
 *she was <unk> & gt me : listen $ headlibrarian when you call me with obscure questions about the internal database structure of your library <unk> where do you think i get the answer 
 you are always impressed that i seem to have such amazing knowledge but you must understand that google is the <unk> of my work and like you i 've spent my career seeking out information through written media 
 now you are a librarian your job is to manage knowledge and teach students how to search out that knowledge 
 put your own skill set to work and apply your ability to <unk> knowledge to this simple problem 
 she was dead silent 
 i took a breath 
 & gt me : now look i 'm not mad 
 in fact this conversation is the moment i 've been waiting for with you so i 'm actually quite happy 
 just believe me when i say that you can do this 
 just do a google search and i promise you will find the answer in half the time it takes for you to call me 
 she took a deep breath 
 & gt hl : okay 
 but can i call you back if i ca n't find the answer 
 & gt me : absolutely and provided you can prove to me you 've done due diligence in looking up the answer for yourself i will not hang up on you ever again 
 i promise 
 & gt hl : okay 
 & gt me : let me know how it goes 
 we hang up 
 i take a deep breath and pray this does n't get me fired 
 five minutes later the following email arrives this is the actual email : pasted in from outlook and anonymized 
 from : $ headlibrarian sent : thursday august 16 2012 <unk> am to : lordpaddington subject : i did it 
 i did it 
 i ca n't believe it actually worked 
 i googled how to plug in computer speakers '' found some instructions and plugged my speakers into the green <unk> in the back 
 it was so easy 
 thank you 
 i emailed back : welcome to freedom $ headlibrarian 
 you 'll like it here '' 
 it 's been 3 years since that day and now when i get support requests from her it comes in the form of an email containing the answer she found on google and how she 's having trouble with one of the steps 
 consequently our professional dialogue has gone from <unk> to learning together 
 best 
 day 
 ever 
 <unk> **edit : ** oh my gosh you guys this kind of a response i was definitely *not* expecting 
 i ca n't begin to thank you enough for your <unk> and kind words of support and perspective 
 thanks especially to the person who gifted gold as a new reddit user i 'm still trying to figure this all out 
 i once managed a <unk> dining restaurant and one day my boss looked at me and said <unk> with every decision you must work toward setting others up for <unk> success failure to do so will <unk> you as a leader 
 * '' it 's one of the <unk> i now live by and what motivated my actions that day with $ <unk> user called in a panic they had a virus and the <unk> wanted their information to start an investigation 
 i laughed out loud into the phone the user did not take that well 
 & gt me : just cut of the internet and i 'll send someone out to look at it for you 
 & gt user : *in a <unk> tone* good you do that this is n't a laughing matter obama 's out to get all is <unk> you know and the <unk> work for him 
 & gt me : ok i 'm sure obama will understand if you cut you internet off for a bit 
 she mumbles something about doing it right now i message one of the field reps that i know is nearby to go by and check her computer for me 
 *** the rep gets there and calls normal procedure to update me he 's trying not to laugh as he begins talking to me 
 & gt rep : hey did you tell her to cut her internet 
 & gt me : ... <unk> i told her to cut her internet off until a rep got by to look at it for her 
 he <unk> out laughing and i hear her in the background ranting about how no one is taking this seriously 
 & gt me : what 's so funny 
 he calms down enough to inform me that she did indeed cut the internet off with a pair of electrical <unk> 
 & gt me : i do n't find as much humor in that as i should i ... which cable did she cut 
 & gt rep : all of them except the power she just unplugged it but she cut the coax coming in from outside all four cat6 cables ... & gt me : did you remove the virus 
 the rep sounds like he is almost in tears now i can her a bit of contagious humor in her rants now 
 & gt me : well is the virus gone 
 & gt rep : yeah it 's gone i closed the popup window the internet explorer popup window it was a web page popup <unk> & gt me : well sod it all ... for once i hang up on the person calling me ... the rep texts back that he got her straightened out and i get to explain to two managers why the virus server did n't detect the infection on a users computer 
 <unk> waiting room waiting on an x-ray figure this was more fun than answering work <unk> rule one : your coffee is golden 
 users coffee is bad 
 in it you’ll often find yourself holding a hot delicious brew whilst looking down at a computer with a liquid retention problem 
 & gt “the fault here would be the coffee you’ve spilt all over it.” you’ll find yourself telling the user 
 <unk> conversation can go one of four ways ** & gt <unk> user <unk> ever <unk> liquid on his/her computer 
 the evidence to the contrary is <unk> heavily with an argument ensuing 
 the user then loudly <unk> your incompetence to the office whilst storming out <unk> of liquid from the computer leaving a trail that you will <unk> have to clean up 
 & gt <unk> <unk> user insists that you <unk> fix it back to how it <unk> inevitably this user’s computer hard drive will have taken the largest sip of the coffee thus rendering the hard drive <unk> 
 your attempts to contact the user to find out the contents of the hard drive will unfortunately fail 
 alas the user is so lost without his/her own computer that basic phone and email use has been temporarily forgotten 
 & gt <unk> a user of class arrives 
 they hand over the computer with grace accepting they made a mistake and praying to the gods of recovery that you help them in their time of need 
 naturally fate <unk> these users too competent to use it services often 
 & gt <unk> a rich user will arrive 
 they will toss down their computer with <unk> <unk> 
 the computer itself is usually a high-end model 
 being from a rich home these devices usually have orders of magnitude more liquid then the cheaper counterparts as if the user himself <unk> the device to work through a <unk> of <unk> 
 these users are busy people they won’t have time for a repair <unk> they’re so busy they’d usually rather not bother even paying you as paying takes too much time 
 **to avoid these incidents happening in your workplace you could attempt the following : ** & gt <unk> everyone desktops 
 lock away the towers in a sealed container 
 <unk> usually <unk> against the it department that manages to lock away desktops usually in the from of a manufacturers fault that requires every pc to be shipped back therefore rendering the entire week of setup to lock the towers away useless 
 & gt <unk> to seal liquids away from users 
 — usually takes the form of signs informing everyone about the lack of liquids allowed near computers 
 these signs are quickly <unk> however can be effective if you find the office busy body and allow them to enforce it 
 watch out for a user <unk> 
 & gt <unk> to enjoy the cleaning 
 — as you’re looking down at the third laptop of the week that needs to be <unk> and smells oddly of yesterdays socks try to remember you’re getting <unk> to do this 
 attempting to pawn this job off to the lowest member of the it team will seed disloyalty 
 avoid disloyalty 
 & gt <unk> a zero expectations rule 
 — telling users if the magic smoke has exited the device no amount of <unk> will get it to go back in 
 unfortunately most users want results not rules so expect arguments many many arguments 
 if you do manage to <unk> a computer that has taken a drink or gone for a <unk> congratulations 
 you can now look forward to that <unk> computer <unk> your department forever 
 trust me 
 it’ll be back 
 rule two a request came in on friday last week that 2 computer room 's equipment needed swapping urgently 
 they are swapped at great speed with our amazing team pulling a massive effort and the important room is ready to go at the end of the day 
 we are told the non important room will have new occupants friday this week so we are <unk> them today 
 this is where the person who is in the important room decides without warning that they must now use both rooms this week 
 even though it was agreed the non important room is out of action until friday 
 they went <unk> to our line manager and put in a complaint that the room was out of action 
 all i can say here is that i 'm really glad we have a fully <unk> helpdesk system 
 i spent 5 minutes with my line manager showing them the requests and agreements 
 all i am left with at the end of this is annoyance at the person who complained 
 they knew what was going on and how long it would take so could only have been trying to make us look bad 
 i just do n't <unk> and i worked long and worked hard 
 machines were building while machines were unwrapped while machines were repacked - this time with larger address labels as per angie’s demands 
 the previously arid air infected by roland seemed more pleasant now that angie had declared he had far more pressing duties to attend to '' 
 that did n't stop angie 's <unk> in micromanagement 
 each visit brought a new list of <unk> which had to be <unk> to her <unk> memory seemed to <unk> every minor piece of <unk> she <unk> her <unk> face and tongue breathing fire at the slightest <unk> 
 qbg and i pulled overtime on <unk> 
 our thanks came with a <unk> pizza on one night followed by an impromptu trip to the local chinese <unk> the next 
 we both worked diligently for our cause until sometime on friday afternoon when the last batch of laptops sat imaging 
 the it cupboard looked like a bomb site 
 discarded <unk> hastily recorded <unk> with various drivers on them several cardboard cups which once contained cheap cost effective canteen coffee and shreds of <unk> tape and <unk> littered the floor 
 i sat on the trolley gently rocked myself back and forth thoroughly shattered as qbg <unk> on the chair 
 our hands were <unk> from the manual lifting but we were finally done 
 we still had no idea if our <unk> for <unk> from bhit was the real reason for roland’s absence but were glad of the break 
 the last laptop completed its imaging process as i struggled to my feet 
 after loading the correct user profiles we loaded the last box onto the trolley 
 we turned the lights out on the it cupboard as we rolled out the door which clanged loudly echoing through the <unk> corridor as the electronic lock <unk> <unk> the cupboard with a <unk> finality 
 as i pushed the trolley towards the mail room again filled top to bottom with our efforts the conversation turned to the conference next week 
 angie 's plan of having a support presence seemed unnaturally <unk> yet seemed to be yet another <unk> of some great <unk> of incompetence 
 we had no real idea of what we were expected to do there and we still had another 50 machines to image as reps waited 
 qbg and i had also realized that our <unk> <unk> time had come to an end a valuable insight we would have never gotten had angie not interfered in the way that she did 
 but mired with her constant micromanagement we were glad it was all over - for now 
 another monday morning 
 the rain and <unk> smacked my <unk> as i could only think of the same old mantra “i hate <unk> ” its had arrived early at the conference centre to set up 
 our support booth <unk> four tables which had been <unk> with all manner of <unk> <unk> 
 it looked like someone had <unk> some <unk> box of <unk> material which now served to <unk> <unk> by 
 a <unk> <unk> stood behind the <unk> supported makeshift tables housing the secondary support area 
 when i arrived i found angie <unk> as some helpdesk <unk> borrowed for the purposes of the day had met her <unk> in some way 
 her shrill demanding voice was evident even over the noise of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> several water heaters in anticipation for the impending delegates 
 angie’s constant barking continued up until our official open time of <unk> at which time she <unk> to <unk> with some apparent acquaintances 
 it always amazed me to see her personality and body language shift so <unk> when <unk> with anyone who wasn’t well us 
 almost as soon as the hall opened our first delegate arrived at the helpdesk brandishing a very familiar laptop bag 
 the delegate bore all the <unk> of a <unk> salesman his suit was worn <unk> around his stomach which showed obvious <unk> to many miles behind his <unk> on <unk> 
 placing the bag on the table he stressed with a clear but jovial <unk> voice that he had received it the previous week but was having problems with it 
 i ushered him into the back of our support area 
 our it setup seemed to impress him 
 the ghost server hummed proudly atop a stack of plastic boxes while stations <unk> with chairs and table space offered spare network cables and power supplies already connected and waiting for their <unk> <unk> 
 “it’s like mission control in here ” the delegate quipped 
 with a <unk> laugh he added “we have lift off ” the delegate presented his laptop 
 as i hooked it up he <unk> a <unk> <unk> notebook filled with scribbling bits of paper and bound by a rubber band from the depths of his suit 
 peering through the <unk> of his rounded <unk> he declared that he had a number of problems 
 he <unk> off each entry on his list as though <unk> from his blue notebook 
 the software though it could open was unable to load profiles or remember preferences which though meant nothing to me meant the world to a marketing <unk> such as this man 
 it also seemed to failed to synchronise in any way with the central database 
 while scanning through the laptop i had also noticed mcafee was failing to update and the image distinctly lacked any installation of ms office 
 the realization that roland had indeed fudged the image was all too real 
 this was <unk> by the sight near the helpdesk tables at <unk> the queue seemed to extend to the far corner of the hall all said the same thing 
 the <unk> tables seemed the final <unk> on the front lines as reps brandishing the same laptop bags came to voice their <unk> 
 tensions ran high as the word spread among the <unk> reps. it had blown it they’d screwed the <unk> and messed up <unk> 
 <unk> spread quickly into the queue 
 our borrowed helpdesk guy was <unk> 
 he was ill-equipped to deal with demand of this magnitude without the simple escape route of simply logging a call for escalation 
 i relieved him with the instruction to find angie 
 in the meantime all we could think to do was accept laptops back <unk> and deal with the fallout later 
 the rear support area filled as some 200 machines lay piled as <unk> of the enormous blunder 
 angie’s <unk> <unk> was complemented with another bout of her ranting and <unk> despite her inability to offer another solution she stormed off in anger leaving us to somehow <unk> <unk> of 200 laptops back to head office 
 two sales and marketing managers also appeared demanding <unk> and reasons for this mother of all <unk> 
 our borrowed helpdesk guy and i loaded the laptops into a hire van for their voyage back to the office 
 our drive back to the office through the rain seemed dark and depressing 
 the rain <unk> off the large metal hulk of the van only <unk> by the <unk> of the soft laptop bags 
 the only thing to look forward to now was another <unk> <unk> through the office yard to return the laptops to their holding cells

 who would have the answer 
 i couldn’t choose between the two candidates 
 sure redcheer had this job created for her but notie seemed so much better equipped 
 the head of hr saw me staring at the wall trying to choose between the two 
 she walked over 
 & gt headhr : airz great news 
 & gt me : oh 
 head of hr you can help me who should i take redcheer notie 
 head of hr looked at me and gave me a “really” face 
 & gt headhr : simple just go with the one thats better 
 anyway listen our local school wants to send some kids here next year 
 & gt me : even if it annoys upper management 
 headhr looked exasperated that i was still talking about a new employee she’d moved on 
 & gt headhr : they’ll be here a week or two just learning seeing how business gets done 
 & gt me : i don’t want to make bigp annoyed but notie is probably so much more useful 
 having already moved on head of hr wasn’t stopping 
 & gt headhr : lots of the kids want to go into it 
 i realised where this was going 
 & gt me : no 
 & gt headhr : just a week and only a few <unk> no no no no 
 if i knew anything its <unk> and it departments don’t mix 
 * & gt me : i’m sorry i can’t take any 
 we’re too busy to be <unk> 
 & gt headhr : its not till next year 
 & gt me : we’re always busy 
 & gt headhr : plus they’ll be 16 or so 
 kids are great with technology 
 they’ll probably teach you a thing or two 
 i didn’t have any doubt there were kids that could come and work in it for a week with no problems 
 i did however doubt i’d get those kids 
 & gt me : i’m <unk> 
 & gt headhr : look i won’t put you down on the sheet in now just think about it though the next <unk> you’ll be teaching the it of the future 
 & gt me : at the rate i’m going the stress will get to me before the future 
 head of hr didn’t hear that last line she’d already walked away 
 i looked down at the paper in front of me 
 reading the words i’d written down 
 **angry 
 ** yes 
 <unk> 
 ** er… 
 i don’t feel like kids in the it dept so… 
 yes 
 <unk> 
 ** oh wait… vp and bigp are waiting for me 
 ***** if you get a chance check out comic progress here next this happened to a coworker at my telco who came to see me so i 'd set up a service call ... he looks pretty <unk> 
 & gt giles : hey bytewave 
 i had a little problem at home 
 i need a service call to replace all my devices figured you could set it up for me and err you know about the work contract discounts 
 does that apply to hardware replacements '' 
 i open his account 
 & gt bytewave : all your devices 
 well - you have a test hd <unk> we replace that for free 
 the three other <unk> plus the two modems are at your charge with standard discount 
 what about your phones '' 
 & gt giles : all three are dead but i only need two replacements '' 
 & gt bytewave : they were too recently upgraded they 'll be full cost i 'm afraid 
 surely you have insurance for this '' 
 as i ask i look at the logs for all his devices 
 they all went dark simultaneously in the evening two days ago 
 & gt bytewave : well i 'll make sure we get this done today but i need to get the skinny here 
 home <unk> lightning strike or what '' 
 & gt giles : yeah big power problem 
 my surge <unk> were <unk> disconnected and all my valuable electronics plugged directly in outlets when this went down 
 tvs monitors computers <unk> even my frigging espresso machine died 
 the service call will have to be for the weekend electrical work to be done first ... and new locks '' 
 ... & gt bytewave : seriously full story now '' 
 he sighs 
 & gt giles : things have n't been great with my girl 
 she kept saying i spend too much time <unk> with my toys and not enough playing with her whatever 
 she knew about my hobbies and i was n't going to change my whole life just because we moved in together 
 few fights then she just told me to choose between her or my toys 
 i was tired of it '' 
 & gt bytewave : so you handled that with <unk> care to end things cleanly after a reasonable conversation about your <unk> differences i assume '' 
 & gt giles : i said <unk> b**** 
 flipped her off and said she should find a new place by the weekend 
 then i blasted bad <unk> 's 'i love my computer on all the sound systems '' 
 & gt bytewave : i see 
 your <unk> <unk> if i remember correctly 
 how 'd that work out for you '' 
 i grin <unk> 
 & gt giles : she stormed off to pack up her stuff but as soon as i had to go for <unk> she unplugged my surge <unk> plugged everything to outlets and messed with some of them then did some witchcraft on the electric panel and killed everything dead 
 not sure how but it was essentially torn out of the wall 
 then she took a large hammer to my <unk> my <unk> games collection and the mini bar 
 she did spare the refrigerator '' 
 i look at him with a mix of confusion and horror 
 & gt giles : <unk> <unk> who cried about <unk> seals 
 had a thing about not wasting food 
 she plugged it in my ups '' 
 ... & gt bytewave : well i 'm sure police will take *that* into account 
 wow man that 's a hell of a pain in the arse but it 's a clear cut case your insurance will cover everything '' 
 & gt giles : my insurance wo n't cover 8 terabytes of data loss soooo much stuff lost 
 plus i 'm probably under <unk> for this level of damage i 'm assessing but i can only get <unk> <unk> '' 
 & gt bytewave : deep <unk> regarding data loss i know how painful that is 
 at least she was n't a <unk> so your building is still standing right 
 if you ever date one of them maybe try some nice couples <unk> 
 ... okay you 're set for replacements on sunday <unk> '' 
 he thanked me with a nod and left me to ponder about the vulnerabilities of my own home setup 
 i should get a nice secure server room one of these days 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 there 's an hardware provider down in the states whom i must speak to once in awhile mostly because their product is often <unk> and they 're the only ones with the tools to confirm before i escalate - sometimes i need to email them evidence to get a confirmation 
 one day i 'm talking to a guy there named tony lane 
 like everyone who works there his full name happens to be 7 or 8 characters long but i never thought about it 
 who questions the name someone introduces themselves as 
 admittedly the last guy i talked to over there last was named john <unk> and the one before was i think gary <unk> but <unk> right 
 until he replies to my email ... ... & gt bytewave : uh tony that email i just sent you.. was instantly forwarded to a sebastian <unk> and you replied with that account 
 <unk> do i call you tony or sebastian '' 
 & gt tony : oops 
 actually my name is n't tony 
 it 's sebastian my bad 
 i was n't supposed to reply this way '' 
 & gt bytewave : ... either is cool with me but i kinda want the story here '' 
 & gt sebastian : well i would n't tell normally but given it was my mistake if you 'll keep a small secret ... yeah sebastian 
 the company <unk> us short and simple names 
 so that we spend less time when we have to give out our email addresses or introduce ourselves call length is <unk> and all 
 it works pretty well usually '' 
 and there i stand in silent awe by the fact he is n't the least bit surprised or flabbergasted that his employer is asking him to ... lie about his name on every single call to <unk> off four seconds 
 it takes me about that long to regroup ... & gt bytewave : ... thank you sebastian sorry for asking '' 
 i was still startled but what is there to do with a <unk> like this 
 beyond surprise for once i had nothing up my sleeve 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 for a second i thought this lady was <unk> me or something : me : ok i’m just going to need you to unplug the power cord from the back of the actiontec router wait 10 seconds and then plug it back in * customer instantly switches to rage mode * customer : what 
 do you understand what you are asking me to do 
 do you understand how difficult that would be 
 me : * trying hard not to laugh <unk> unplug the power 
 customer : yes i’d have to move all this crap and i’d have to move this huge desk and everything to get to it 
 this is absolutely unacceptable 
 me : but you said the actiontec is sitting right there in front of you right 
 customer : yes 
 me : you just have to unplug right it from the back of the actiontec not from the wall <unk> customer : <unk> is as live as it gets 
 i 'm at the office at my telco this afternoon for a monthly meeting 
 no actual work to do besides attending said meeting so a little time to reddit 
 no employees to help out or other calls to answer 
 as i came in i was surprised to see gregory the top guy at our internal it department - previously featured in a few tales 
 at this point it 's actually easier to link google than individual tales 
 short version : he 's the best we got down there 
 & gt bytewave : hey 
 gregory what are you doing this far up the tower '' 
 & gt gregory : hey man 
 i 'm just here for an <unk> keyboard '' 
 & gt bytewave : ... & gt gregory : come on you did internal it too before right 
 <unk> keyboard 
 .. '' & gt bytewave : .. oh <unk> 
 cleaning maid 
 but this is a tech support floor 
 please tell me it 's a manager please '' 
 & gt gregory : yeah it is duh 
 <unk> 
 anyhow i got ta go 'fix it 
 see you soon '' 
 & gt bytewave : of course 
 let 's have coffee downstairs again sometime soon '' 
 soon after my phone buzzed with a <unk> i already knew by then what it was but i still had to offer a mild slow clap on general principle 
 <unk> : a manager called in-house it to come up 15 floors to 'fix a problem with their keyboard 
 janitorial staff had cleaned their keyboard but accidentally pushed down one of the pins 
 the keyboard was <unk> 
 so of course the manager had to call it to fix the problem 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 sadly my first tale here is not my own but was shared by a co-worker this morning 
 he received a call from our engineer claiming that windows was trying to delete his computer ... he promptly walks into the office to find that no matter what the user clicked on the are you sure you want to delete x '' 
 dialog appeared 
 without much thought he ran a quick virus scan but nothing came up 
 he then suggested rebooting the machine to see if anything changed 
 as he went to reach for the power button he noticed something ... the user was using a laptop seated in a dock the screen was open and his was phone laying on the keyboard 
 the weight of the phone was just enough to press the edge down onto the delete key ... he moved the phone off of the keyboard and miraculously windows lost it 's interest in digital <unk> i work at a relatively small software development place usually focusing on making web-based <unk> solutions for individual customers 
 as such we 're often asked to help with general tech support and database management 
 allow me to set the scene : it 's early on a monday morning everything is quiet and everyone is going about their usual monday morning routines <unk> changes to live sites catching up on easy tickets and the like 
 suddenly the silence is shattered by the shrill sound of the telephone ringing 
 it gets picked up and i kind of zone out again carrying on testing my current bit of work and listening to music 
 my interest is <unk> when i hear my co-worker <unk> the server is what 
 everyone stops what they 're doing and looks up my co-worker on the phone has suddenly gone quite pale and <unk> 
 as it turns out the customer 's database server has been quietly smoking for the past half an hour or so and someone finally realised that servers should not be smoking 
 but of course they would n't do the logical thing and turn the server off oh no they <unk> and <unk> called us for a 5 minute <unk> chat this is quite normal for this employee from this firm <unk> they calmly drop the bomb that the server is currently smoking and if it is n't too much trouble if we could perform a <unk> backup via remote desktop quickly 
 **tl dr : ** server starts smoking customer leaves it for half an hour before thinking to call someone previous <unk> builders 
 & gt gbuild : airz we want out of the web filter 
 & gt me : sorry what 
 gbuilder had an annoyed expression on his face he <unk> explained 
 & gt gbuilder : when you hooked us up to the internet all our computers go through your company filter which blocks out words we builders search for all the time 
 i tried to think of anything our web filter actually blocked almost nothing 
 & gt me : er what do you mean 
 the web filter doesn’t block keywords 
 & gt gbuilder : well say we needed to look up the right <unk> we wanted to mate it with a wall well your filter would block that search because <unk> and <unk> are apparently <unk> 
 & gt me : no… it wouldn’t we only blacklist sites we don’t search for keywords 
 the builder sighed he didn’t seem that keen to end the conversation 
 i think he just liked talking 
 & gt gbuilder : look you’re really <unk> us down with our prep 
 i think we should take this to upper management 
 can you schedule a meeting with your boss 
 & gt me : i am the boss of it 
 the answer for <unk> you not go through the <unk> is no 
 i thought about the sites on the blacklist and wondered what builders would need to access <unk> or porn sites for 
 the builder did not looked pleased with my response 
 he pulled out his mobile phone and rang the vp 
 within moments the vp was inside my office 
 & gt vp : airz gbuilder 
 whats going on 
 & gt gbuilder : airz has connected us up to the internet for our site office but its being filtered so we can’t get the work done that we need to 
 the vp turned to me his smile slowly growing 
 i thought i’d best get my side in 
 & gt me : they’re not being filtered only porn and <unk> sites are blacklisted as per company policy 
 & gt gbuilder : we can’t search things like <unk> and hammering 
 it makes the internet useless for a builder 
 & gt vp : airz you really should get rid of that nasty filtering 
 i thought about our companies internet setup 
 i smiled a little 
 & gt me : okay i can do that 
 the head builder started smiling the vp however looked slightly confused 
 & gt me : only problem is all the websites they visit will be <unk> the smile dropped off the head builders face 
 vp’s confused face suddenly look much less confused 
 & gt gbuilder : that 's unacceptable 
 i can’t have people tracking what we do… & gt me : why not 
 the head builder looked angry his eyes started searching for a good response 
 & gt gbuilder : trade secrets 
 we can’t have people being able to track how we do our craft 
 & gt me : building things isn’t a craft 
 & gt vp : i really think we should all take a step <unk> airz do you <unk> want to know what builders look up 
 vp gave me a knowing look 
 & gt vp : sometimes people work a little better when they’re not <unk> 
 … 
 … 
 … 
 about someone looking over their shoulder 
 i was surprised the vp was taking this approach 
 it was oddly <unk> 
 & gt me : i er… guess we could work something out 
 did i just get convinced <unk> the vp 
 i need a coffee 
 next previous i sat in head of hr’s office 
 looking around at the odd poster choices 
 half dystopian <unk> half <unk> <unk> 
 strange 
 the head of hr sat opposite behind her desk 
 she was giving me a resigned gaze 
 & gt headhr : airz 
 i heard your little speech 
 just a tip i would never swear at hr employees 
 they know every hostile workplace law backwards 
 you’re lucky they know you’re trying to help 
 & gt me : oh 
 yes 
 <unk> 
 bad 
 my ability to form <unk> was hampered by the fact i actually thought the hr employees in question needed a good swearing at 
 & gt headhr : its not easy being in hr you know… the head of hr’s head turned from looking at the beach posters to my right over to the dystopian ones on the left 
 & gt me : no 
 i imagine it’s about as fun as it sometimes 
 & gt headhr : human resources has it worse 
 trust me 
 i looked at the <unk> on my right 
 i chuckled and started to leave 
 & gt headhr : don’t believe me 
 my day starts early when everyone comes into hr and by hand to submit their holiday leave forms 
 & gt me : aren’t <unk> submitted electronically 
 the fact that <unk> <unk> were considered bad 
 i couldn’t help but chuckle again 
 & gt headhr : they could 
 but they don’t 
 they come here to hr 
 always early in the day to submit them and whilst doing so they tell us about all their plans 
 how much fun they’re going to have the tales they hope to come back with 
 i’ve heard enough holiday plans to start a travel agency 
 & gt me : you don’t like talking 
 in it you get two types 
 the ones that don’t say a word and ignore you or the ones that complain 
 i’d love to talk about holidays that sounds relaxing 
 i looked again at the beach poster on the wall 
 i <unk> & gt headhr : relaxing 
 trust me once you’ve heard of all the great fun they’re going to have you’ll start wondering what you’re going to be doing during those weeks then it hits you 
 you’ll be here 
 again 
 the head of hr stared forlornly at the beach poster 
 & gt headhr : after the morning holiday planning session you get to the complaints 
 two employees always still half fighting walk into hr with respective bosses 
 everyone just looking at you to sort out their problems 
 no matter how fair you are everyone always hates you just a little more after those meetings 
 head of hr looked at me 
 was she looking for sympathy 
 … 
 she was looking in the wrong place 
 & gt me : in it not only do we have to sort out everyone 's problems but they *also* want us to come to <unk> 
 & gt headhr : then comes the afternoon you get people ringing hr just looking for jobs 
 you’ll tell them we advertise them in various places but they won’t listen 
 they’ll tell you they need a job badly and then comes the <unk> head of hr’s eyes <unk> and she started looking towards the dystopian posters 
 & gt headhr : its always sad 
 you want to help but you can’t 
 you’re literally forced to tell them the same thing as everyone else 
 but do you know the kicker 
 & gt me : er… & gt headhr : they’re usually lying 
 her serious face her shock at the lies i started laughing 
 hard 
 & gt me : have you heard the excuses they give it 
 my screen <unk> because i punched it but because of a manufacturing fault 
 my laptop got viruses because it didn’t pay off the <unk> community 
 trust me it’s worse 
 & gt headhr : oh yeah 
 head of hr looked at me intently 
 & gt me : at least 100 times worse 
 she started to smile 
 her entire chair <unk> round to face the beach poster 
 & gt headhr : oh… good … at least someone understands then 
 head of hr seemed happy 
 i wasn’t though… bad cop <unk> 
 better get coffee i thought 
 ***** next **new** comic here full credit to <unk> and <unk> 
 discussion for the comic is here previous as i stood in a crowd of designers and thought about a way to describe shoes i wondered if all jobs turned out this way 
 probably for me they would 
 inspiration i needed inspiration 
 i looked around for anything that could help 
 nothing 
 not even a poster was on the walls 
 & gt me : shoes to me define the man 
 i looked around the room everyone seemed oddly interested 
 & gt me : if on the street you see a man with no shoes you don’t think what a cool guy 
 no 
 you’re reminded about <unk> 
 however if you see a man with great shoes you envy his success in life 
 scarfy sat open mouthed staring up at me 
 i couldn’t think of another word to say so i sat down 
 & gt carefree : now that was excellent airz 
 … 
 carefree continued to chat about the design <unk> i tuned out after a while 
 i was happy just <unk> the odd look of confusion and pain on scarfy’s face 
 ***** near the end of the meeting carefree opened up the floor for general questions 
 a designer with <unk> put up his hand 
 & gt dread : what happened with the internet yesterday 
 carefree looked to me i realised this was turning into a forum session 
 & gt me : it went down because water got into the line 
 & gt dread : it was down for almost an hour how is that acceptable 
 i looked over to carefree waiting for direction on how to answer that question 
 & gt carefree : i think we should be thanking airz for getting the internet working again so quickly 
 the dreadlocked man looked a little sheepish after that <unk> but recovered quickly 
 & gt dread : i saw you airz wrapping a box outside in plastic 
 didn’t you know plastic bags are banned in this office 
 i wondered where the dreadlocked designer learnt my name from 
 i decided i didn’t care about him or his opinions 
 & gt airz : unfortunately in this situation plastic is the easiest way of waterproofing the problem 
 & gt dread : i think we should find a more sustainable way of waterproofing 
 i really didn’t care if he could find a way to do it without plastic 
 the internet was working that 's all i cared about 
 scarfy looked over at me with disdain on his face and decided he wanted to comment as well 
 & gt scarfy : i agree with dread we really should n't be <unk> the environment for internet 
 imagine all the <unk> <unk> we could save if we could find a better way of doing things 
 i think <unk> is the key here at the office <unk> our <unk> with plastic and making us <unk> upon plastic is damaging 
 i honestly didn’t know what he was trying to say 
 oddly though other designers were nodding their heads in agreement 
 carefree looked concerned 
 & gt carefree : yes 
 i’ll get airz to look into it 
 for the environment 
 the meeting broke up after that most of the designers left to start work again 
 carefree signaled me over 
 & gt carefree : we got ta get rid of that plastic bag or <unk> be a <unk> 
 & gt me : its literally the only thing keeping the internet up… & gt carefree : try to think of a more sustainable solution 
 i looked around to see if anyone else was <unk> this madness 
 no one seemed to care 
 outside the rain continued to fall 
 stupid rain

 customer : i guess so me : ... so is there anything else 
 customer : no this <unk> of idiocy does n't come from my regular job in it but from helping out a family member about <unk> ago 
 <unk> around the house as i do on a fine friday evening trying to erase the day 's memories via beer i get these frantic messages from my cousin ... the education department of state wo n't let me log in to see my final marks '' 
 as in you ca n't log in or the marks are not there '' 
 i ca n't log in '' 
 oh is your password ok 
 are you entering everything well '' 
 well it 's asking me for my student id but i just graduated and i ca n't use that anymore '' 
 have you logged onto this website before with this number '' 
 yes ... '' so it will still be the same number '' but i just graduated 
 the school does n't use the id anymore '' 
 have you actually tried logging on with it yet '' 
 *long period of silence ... * oh it works now all good '' 
 this is why i <unk> in most <unk> and especially in call centres it 's not unusual for management to play <unk> with sick employees and it 's all too common that it works 
 even the best job security still requires you to do your part 
 turn in doctor papers get your <unk> documented etc 
 but what happens when the nature of your illness prevents you from realizing you were ever sick 
 all too often you lose your job without even realizing what 's happening 
 not here not anymore 
 years ago a frontline employee at my telco with many years of perfectly <unk> employment slowly started <unk> <unk> 
 his name andrew started popping in senior staff 's coaching reports 
 he randomly gave incredibly <unk> diagnosis to customers 
 i listened to a call where he ranted <unk> about ufos when a customer 's node was down 
 colleagues had already noticed he was very withdrawn and seemed to have stopped washing his clothes and all conversations with him ended in non <unk> 
 then andrew sometimes just got up in the middle of his shift and walked out 
 soon after we noticed he started sometimes coming in on days he was n't scheduled to work and took calls without pay 
 most <unk> he insisted all was fine in the world if anything he had started looking at <unk> <unk> suspiciously like if something was wrong with <unk> 
 it was obvious something was seriously wrong with him and the union steward told his manager in writing he needed to be granted extended sick leave immediately and that the medical office should order an independent expert diagnosis of whatever afflicted him 
 scumbag manager instead focused on the fact he sometimes walked out of his shift without warning 
 any union employee can do that with mere notification at a moment 's notice - an email will do - and it just gets taken off your sick <unk> - no biggie 
 but leave without *any* warning and it 's a fairly severe offense that rapidly <unk> to suspension or being fired for cause 
 obviously the guy 's sick though no manager could possibly hold it against him right 
 ... & gt bytewave : senior line bytewave you may send me your ticket '' 
 & gt andrew : oh nevermind ... i have to go 
 boss seems angry '' 
 what 
 i look down i can see his desk from senior staff 's upper <unk> 
 his manager is talking to him 
 he had a customer on the line he actually sent me his ticket and then he just ... hung up out of the blue and followed the manager 
 next to the manager 's desk was a reliable and <unk> guy 
 i get his extension and have him on the line in seconds 
 & gt bytewave : thomas your boss is coming to his desk with andrew i 'd like you to keep this line live a minute and listen to what 's going on 
 andrew should n't even be here by now we 're all worried 
 i 'll erase this call from the recording software afterwards '' 
 thomas complies happily 
 within a minute it 's obvious what 's happening 
 not only is his manager berating him specifically about the fact he recently left the floor without warning but he says the magic number 5 times '' grounds for 5 disciplinary letters exactly enough to fire someone for cause 
 andrew clearly does n't even understand what 's going on from what thomas tells me in <unk> tones but he says he 's <unk> <unk> 
 this is an obvious case of wrongful termination any <unk> will give us this one straight up especially given the union had formally recommended he receive independent medical analysis 
 but it 's way too risky when the guy is convinced all is fine in the world and may end up saying he left voluntarily 
 best force the issue 
 i dial the floor 's union steward mute him and conference in building security 
 & gt bytewave : senior staff priority call 
 we have a very agitated employee who must be taken to a secure room temporarily 
 suspect serious medical issue please alert emergency services immediately '' 
 while the scumbag manager is still explaining what the letters in his hands mean three building <unk> walk into the floor like their life suddenly has purpose 
 it 's not everyday they get to do something other than use the <unk> cameras to zoom on cute <unk> walking down the street 
 yes they really do that ... they swiftly take andrew to holding over the manager 's protests any medical crisis is <unk> to <unk> management 's say so 
 twenty minutes later <unk> and police are all over it while the union steward has dragged the manager into the director 's office 
 soon after andrew is on extended sick leave and under care - against his will sadly but his condition required it 
 we had n't forgotten that management had been given written notice two months ahead of time about the problem and much less what this specific manager tried to do with the info 
 plenty of grounds for a grievance 
 fast forward a year the grievance is granted in arbitration and the union 's health and safety vp now has power to order medical <unk> on advice of the council if management fails to act on such a <unk> - and the offending manager has been <unk> to an obscure low-level position where he can do no harm 
 he 's in charge of letters about contract changes notifications to customers - still too good for him but at least out of my sight 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 friday <unk> the clock in my office was ticking notoriously slowly 
 with sheer willpower i <unk> it to go faster 
 weekend i thought 
 the clock refused to move faster 
 annoying thing 
 i turned my attention to my blank inbox and queue 
 perfect 
 looking out into the department i could tell most people were waiting for me to leave 
 i too was looking forward to it 
 just a little longer 
 *bing* an email popped into my inbox 
 i frowned at it and hoped it was spam 
 & gt “my computers making weird noises.” - secretary 
 i read then <unk> the email 
 it looked like a monday job 
 future airz could take care of this i thought to myself 
 i quickly replied urging the secretary to turn off the machine and go home for the weekend 
 back to staring at the clock which i could have sworn was going backwards 
 stupid thing i bet it was cheaply made 
 *bing* another email 
 i’d grown tired of the constant flow all week 
 who sends emails on friday after three 
 <unk> b @ # $ # @ # <unk> 
 & gt <unk> wondering can i get a new <unk> ... <unk> should i just reply with a single line 
 i <unk> with myself 
 i decided a single word was more efficient 
 no 
 smiling to myself that i’d been so productive on friday afternoon i went back to <unk> the clock with my stare 
 it defiantly wasn’t working 
 i considered replacing the clock entirely 
 *bing* three 
 three emails after 4pm on a friday 
 what the hell 
 since i was a model employee i opened this one as well mentally noting that i deserved a pay rise 
 & gt “i’ve lost my <unk> <unk> 
 oh darn 
 an email that actually requires attention 
 i frowned at the <unk> clock and walked into it to find messy 
 **** messy was the newest employee of it 
 he seemed to have some non specific relation to someone else at the company 
 he always dressed extremely professionally but he had this air of mess about him 
 his hair never seemed to be under control he always had <unk> of some kind on his face 
 yet oddly his suits always remained <unk> 
 it was weird 
 arriving at messy’s desk i was inspired by how much <unk> he’d managed to <unk> whilst only being at the company a few weeks 
 & gt messy : i swear i had my phone at lunch and i had it when i got back to my desk 
 now its gone 
 & gt me : have you tried calling it 
 messy had the receiver in his hand he <unk> his number so quickly into the keypad i could tell he’d been recently <unk> 
 a lot 
 i was tempted to inform him of the <unk> button but <unk> as i saw his clearly determined smashing at the buttons 
 clearly stress relief 
 & gt messy : it’s ringing but i cant even hear the buzz 
 i swear i haven’t moved from this spot 
 messy was throwing papers everywhere searching for it 
 i looked up at the clock in the department 
 it was already nearing 5 pm 
 what a good clock 
 perhaps i should replace mine with this one i though to myself 
 & gt me : i guess i’ll help 
 i got to my knees and started looking below the desk whilst messy attacked the top with a passion 
 below his desk was a myriad of different objects 
 i even found a half <unk> bagel which i moved away with the end of a pen 
 & gt messy : so thats were that went 
 messy looked down at the bagel i was dragging across the floor with my pen 
 he grabbed the bagel shoved it in his mouth 
 my face must have shown my disgust he quickly <unk> his actions 
 & gt messy : don’t worry its fresh 
 it was <unk> morning snack 
 messy joined me on the floor as we searched 
 i tried to stay far as far away from the dirty old bagel that was hanging from messy’s face as possible 
 eventually after much searching we gave up the hunt 
 at this point most of the office had realized i wasn’t leaving and gave up all pretext of <unk> <unk> and just left 
 & gt messy : darn it 
 it’s a new phone too 
 what am i gon na do now 
 & gt me : ahh can you think of anywhere else it could be 
 at the shake of <unk> head i had to shrug 
 nothing could be done 
 i wandered back to my office and looked up at my office clock again 
 <unk> what the hell clock 
 i tried to justify leaving since the other clock said 5. i couldn’t do it 
 my clock didn’t say 5. i sat back down at my computer dejectedly 
 one email was sitting waiting for me 
 four 
 i thought to myself 
 four emails after 4 on a friday 
 this was getting outrageous 
 & gt “hey it i turned the computer off 
 even unplugged it 
 it’s still making noises.” - secretary 
 huh 
 that is weird 
 i decided to call the secretary herself but she’d apparently <unk> my earlier message to go home 
 i <unk> up to her desk myself to take a look at the computer 
 it wasn’t making a sound though 
 <unk> i decided i may as well take it down to it 
 as i carried it downstairs i heard the distinctive rattle of something wrong 
 something loose 
 entering the it department i caught messy just about to leave 
 & gt me : give your phone one last try 
 you never know 
 messy grabbed the nearest phone and absolutely hammered the numbers into the keypad 
 the entire desk shook as he smashed down on it 
 as soon as it started ringing the computer in my hands started to rattle and <unk> 
 & gt messy : i hear it now 
 & gt me : it’s in here 
 passing messy the computer he looked at me confusedly 
 then proceeded to crack open the case 
 his phone was sitting in a hard drive bay 
 & gt messy : huh ... i shook my head as messy left for the day wondering how he even survived in the real world 
 i didn’t have much time to ponder it as it slowly dawned on me that my weekend must be starting 
 i entered my office to collect my things and looked gleefully up at the clock 
 4.31 
 & gt me : seriously 
 screw the clock i thought to myself as i collected all my belongings and marched out the door 
 4.31 is close enough to 5 pm on a friday in my mind 
 previous -- -- -- -- -- -- -- as i started walking over to see colourblind my coffee cup whispered to me 
 it had a devious plan to level the playing field 
 & gt me : everyone wants everything to be fair 
 i said that out loud to no one in particular 
 a few techs looked up from the desks but the competition meant they didn’t have time to diagnose the nonsense i was saying out loud 
 not with a weeks holiday on offer 
 i got back to my desk and looked at the queue of tickets that hadn’t been picked up by anyone 
 it was empty 
 **new email** & gt <unk> to the competition employee’s may not for the next week throw tickets back into the queue after taking them 
 * — airz head of it 
 i smiled 
 time to make some tickets 
 i looked at <unk> ticket queue he had two open tickets 
 excellent three spaces to fill 
 **new ticket** & gt *a tech needs to cross match every asset our internal asset list with the physical locations of the <unk> - estimated time **60 minutes** physically checking every computer in the company that might take a <unk> **new ticket** & gt *a tech is needed to clean out every dust trap in all the servers located in the server room 
 * - estimated time **60 minutes** just getting the keys for every rack in the server room would take hours 
 i took a sip of my coffee mercy was probably the best approach 
 **new ticket** & gt <unk> idea for the it consultant needed anything at all 
 * <unk> time **60 minutes** i knew it would take about 3 seconds to think of an idea but the other two would take probably days 
 i released the demons straight onto the it queue sure enough colourblind’s account took all three tickets straight away 
 i then changed the settings so no one could <unk> tickets into the queue 
 i took a sip of my coffee 
 i smiled 
 fair did feel good 
 <unk> the afternoon began passing very <unk> as i sat down at my desk to my late afternoon coffee i dreamt about a world without jobs 
 it was weird 
 a knock at the door woke me from my thoughts 
 & gt itsec : boss hey 
 & gt me : haha you don’t have to call me boss down here 
 & gt itsec : could i have a chat 
 since coffee was the only thing on my schedule i invited him to sit down 
 & gt itsec : so umm i saw you sent solitaire and hockey <unk> & gt me : yeah they where pretty stressed 
 & gt itsec : you know how i came here and i’ll admit didn’t know much <unk> computers and stuff 
 i took a sip of my coffee where was this going 
 & gt itsec : well solitaire helped me a bunch 
 he made it so i could pick out tickets before they became available to other people that way i could do the jobs i had knowledge of… & gt me : wait what 
 & gt itsec : i didn’t know how to do a bunch of things so every ticket that came in i’d have a 30 second window to take it before it would be available to everyone else 
 that way i could just take the <unk> 
 & gt me : so that 's why every ticket starts its life on 30 seconds 
 i took a sip of my coffee 
 i couldn’t tell if it was angry bitter or impressive coffee 
 & gt itsec : yeah the <unk> anyway i’m just telling you because i realize i should be taken out of the race for the week off 
 since i can’t do everything and its sorta cheating 
 & gt me : <unk> every ticket you get first pick of 
 & gt itsec : i didn’t take all the ones i could do just needed the leg up so i could be <unk> useful 
 i looked down at my coffee 
 it smelt good and honest 
 & gt me : take the afternoon off 
 or whats left of it 
 & gt itsec : and make sure you take me out of the running for the competition 
 its really not fair… now that i think about it 
 & gt me : mmm okay 
 now go home 
 i sat back in my chair 
 huh 
 its actually quite peaceful 
 <unk> next reading this story has just reminded me of my old <unk> script 
 we all know users never actually try restarting their pcs before calling us and lying to tell us that they have 
 this beings back memories of a place i used to work at where there were problems launching software every few days 
 back then everyone on win2k or xp <unk> 1 - pcs on for weeks at a time with applications open for days at a time 
 due to this i used to get inundated with support calls and used to psexec a batch file to pcs to fix them '' 
 users were given warning to save everything ahead of time and then off it went 
 the contents of this batch file are as below : title computer recycle <unk> cd <unk> dir route print ipconfig <unk> type <unk> net view arp -a <unk> <unk> shutdown -r <unk> 00 essentially go to <unk> run a bunch of <unk> crap to make the user think their issue was being fixed then reboot 
 this little toy '' used to fix <unk> problems on that otherwise stable network 
 on the occasions where it did n't work we knew a helpdesk member was required and <unk> one immediately 
 to my knowledge this is still being used today - nearly 7 years later or at least was last year when i consulted for them briefly on a voip router upgrade 
 **edit : a huge thankyou to whoever <unk> this : ** previous i was annoyed and not the good kind of annoyed the “i’ve just spent half an hour on <unk> kind of annoyed 
 the red headed lady was still sitting next to me 
 & gt redcheer : so any other good ideas for my winnings 
 i had enough of being on hold 
 i could not care anymore no internet was worth this 
 & gt me : i err… <unk> nah 
 i can’t think of a good one 
 & gt redcheer : fine 
 you know what 
 no coffee for you today thats my winnings 
 i looked over at the break room coffee would make this go faster 
 i considered <unk> over and making a quick cup i knew the operator would be back while im gone though 
 its a curse 
 carefree made his way over to me as if <unk> my distress 
 & gt carefree : airz any eta on when the internet will be back the designers are getting <unk> 
 & gt me : no idea i’m afraid i’m on hold 
 & gt carefree : you look frazzled give me the phone go take a break 
 & gt redcheer : no coffee though 
 i looked over at the break room without coffee it wasn’t worth walking over 
 i decided instead i’d step outside and let the rain and cool air refresh me 
 the red haired lady decided she’d follow 
 hearing the rain breathing the sweet air i felt a little better 
 seeing clearly again i looked over at the communication pit outside the office 
 & gt me : whats that… 
 <unk> thing coming out of the ground over there 
 & gt redcheer : mmmm no idea 
 the rain was coming down hard i ran over to the pit 
 a bunch of cords were coming out of the pit and into a plastic container then hoping over the <unk> of the property and making a <unk> for the <unk> room 
 the container was filled with rain 
 & gt me : huh 
 i poured the rain out of the container and looked into the plastic hell 
 connections everywhere 
 i heard a shout from inside 
 & gt redcheer : i think they’re saying the internet is working again airz 
 i looked down at the plastic container in my hands and the wire strung across the front of the building 
 not buried not covered just strung 
 this was just… i put the container back on the ground and made my way inside 
 & gt redcheer : no no it just stopped again weird 
 the plastic was slowly filling with rain again 
 & gt me : i need some plastic bags and a bunch of tape 
 & gt redcheer : oh we don’t really do… plastic here 
 i thought about the time she told me they didn’t do plastic cups here 
 seemed like a similar situation 
 & gt me : seriously though i need plastic bags and tape 
 & gt redcheer : seriously to you 
 we don’t have plastic bags 
 i can get tape 
 & gt me : ahhh i’ll go ask carefree can you get the tape 
 & gt redcheer : you know after being in the rain i was gon na let you get coffee to warm up but now… still no coffee today 
 i walked over to carefree and asked about the plastic bag situation he said they didn’t have any 
 i felt a little bad 
 & gt me : i’m going to have to go to the store to get some plastic bags 
 & gt carefree : <unk> i stay on the phone 
 & gt me : probably a good idea 
 as i walked to the store i realized i couldn’t physically get any more soaked 
 i thought about going in and asking for just some plastic bags but it felt wrong not buying anything… & gt me : one coffee and some plastic shopping bags please 
 & gt storeowner : sorry a coffee… and 
 & gt me : just a few shopping bags please 
 i pointed down at the shopping bags the owner was very confused 
 & gt storeowner : sooo you want the coffee in the bag 
 & gt me : er no 
 i just want a few bags 
 & gt storeowner : sorry… okay 
 the owner then proceeded to make the coffee and then puts the coffee cup into a shopping bag 
 & gt me : thanks 
 could i get a few more bags please 
 the store owner then takes the coffee which is inside a bag and places it inside another bag which he then places inside another <unk> & gt me : errr… thanks 
 i tried to smile as i held my coffee surrounded by 5 bags 
 i tried to <unk> 
 plastic was in the way 
 i took my coffee out of the five bag protection 
 as i walked back to the office i saw my coffee slowly getting weaker and colder from the rain 
 i shouldn’t have taken it out of its plastic protection 
 getting back to the office red haired lady walks over with some tape and a mug 
 & gt redcheer : airz you 're soaked 
 i brought you a <unk> ... she looked at what i was holding and just handed me the tape 
 & gt me : thanks 
 she stormed off 
 i didn’t have time to work out why i decided the internet needed fixing 
 pronto 
 i went outside with my plastic and tape poured the water out of the plastic container again then covered everything in plastic and tape 
 i added layer upon layer 
 as i walked back inside i could see the internet had indeed started working i saw carefree still on the phone to the isp 
 & gt carefree : oh it looks like its working now 
 should i stay on the phone 
 i took the receiver out of his hands and promptly hung up 
 & gt me : you look frazzled 
 go take a break 
 i smiled and got one in return from carefree 
 i looked down at my coffee and took a sip 
 problem solved 
 everything was good 
 right 
 next i used to work for an engineering company 
 but of course there were folks in finance and other infrastructure departments who were not familiar with technology 
 the entire it department was in a locked area 
 about half the company was in a locked area of one kind or another because we did classified work for the government 
 standard operating procedure for us 
 each closed area had an alarm keypad and door combo keypad next to the door 
 most areas also had a phone hanging on the wall next to the door so you could call the person you wanted to see to let them know you were at the door 
 no <unk> not <unk> given the size of the locked areas and the fact that there could be over 100 people in there 
 the manager of the it department had her office outside the door 
 so some woman had to come see someone at the helpdesk one day 
 she had to pick up a laptop or something 
 so she’s told where the door is and to use the phone to call the person when she gets there 
 she shows up fails to see the phone hanging next to the door but sees the alarm keypad 
 she <unk> in the guy’s phone number on the alarm keypad and starts yelling into the alarm keypad 
 wtf 
 the manager was in her office and came out to see if she could help the <unk> 
 the fallout from this was that the manager jumped down the neck of the helpdesk staff to be more user friendly 
 we had to move the phone 6 inches closer to the door 
 put a huge sign with big red letters and a big red arrow that said phone on it 
 put a bigger sign on the door with <unk> extension on it 
 all because this one woman was too stupid to recognize a phone and use it properly 
 i initially planned to post this only to <unk> because it 's very niche but it 's really a tech support story too 
 i used to do quite a bit more <unk> as a <unk> general purpose it guy 
 few years ago i no longer needed as much money and raised my rates to ensure my workload would be <unk> and what was left was more <unk> 
 i had some <unk> customers who kept <unk> on me as needed 
 recently on that basis i got the most fun private job i was ever offered 
 & gt customer : yeah i remember all the times you helped me out 
 last time we were chatting you mentioned you played skyrim and stuff 
 i googled the email address on your business card 
 you do n't just play do you 
 you 're a known <unk> '' 
 & gt bytewave : i suppose i am yes 
 i 've contributed to some projects 
 mostly step what can i help you with '' 
 & gt customer : i just love this game 
 i tried modding it on my own but it crashes all the time now 
 i need a professional 
 just emailed you my load order '' 
 ... <unk> mods <unk> <unk> 
 that 's a very heavily <unk> game those only stay stable if you really know what you 're doing 
 the scripting engine for that game is incredibly <unk> 
 throw too many mods at papyrus and you end up with more <unk> than <unk> 
 it 's the big secret to modding skyrim 
 you need to be aware at all times of what scripts will be running and keep it light if you want a stable load order 
 <unk> mods do n't really hurt - my skyrim install is over 50 gigs because of heavy <unk> and yet never crashes 
 & gt bytewave : yup i see the problem 
 papyrus <unk> 
 need to make some choices here 
 your worst problem is the amount of scripts running while you 're in combat bet you <unk> often when <unk> spells '' 
 & gt customer : suspected as much and figuring that <unk> you 're the guy i need 
 look i 'd like you to build an install up from scratch i just emailed you a list of what i ca n't live without and what would be nice 
 then you rebuild the install on a ssd i 'll give you and you test it - heavily 
 like do a completionist playthrough this is n't a rush thing 
 look for little issues and fix them 
 once you 're confident everything is pretty much right and <unk> hand it back to me 
 and for the love of god <unk> the <unk> i ca n't get everything to look right everywhere i 'm so tired of trying to do that '' 
 ... the email in question lists dozens of <unk> mods 
 everything from <unk> shouts in <unk> to interesting <unk> 
 <unk> and weather mods 
 <unk> calibration 
 thankfully the <unk> list was actually rather light on <unk> mods and most of it was entirely compatible with step a project i 'm well familiar with 
 it 's the core of every of my own skyrim installs 
 i <unk> there some under another name 
 & gt bytewave : modding an install this size alone takes quite a few hours 
 testing it properly is the kind of thing only true <unk> put in 
 a completionist playthrough on skyrim takes a couple hundred hours 
 we 're also going to make a few <unk> i have <unk> <unk> for a few of your mods 
 but you know my new hourly rates given how big a job this could be are you sure you.. '' & gt customer : yup do n't really care 
 i 'm retired now 
 not taking any money to heaven 
 your new rate no matter the hours if the quality is there '' 
 ... i was just about to tell him that since i love playing that game and it was a big contract i was willing to <unk> my usual rate but ... well i 'm only human 
 he 's ready to pay full price i 'll take it 
 told myself i 'd focus extra hard to make it utterly <unk> to make sure he got his <unk> worth 
 and i did 
 i ca n't know what other <unk> managed to pull off but i doubt there are as many skyrim installs that are as <unk> yet stable than the one i built him and then tested for two months 
 much <unk> during the test phase but at the end i thought it was damn close to perfect 
 was wonderful because i had not only gotten paid for modding and testing a game i love but also got to use the work for my own use as the basis of my new skyrim install 
 it was both the biggest contract i got in years and yet one of the most fun - even though like with any skyrim <unk> this heavy there were dozen of minor issues i had to pick apart one by one 
 everyone who ever saw a <unk> with invisible <unk> or crashes around sky <unk> temple will understand 
 i did troubleshoot installs before for my own <unk> and it was incredible to know that this time around i was being generously paid for it 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 previous an it meeting with the vp what wrong did i do to deserve this 
 the vp had decided against my strong <unk> to implement an it competition for who could complete the most tickets 
 & gt vp : this competition will measure who is the fastest it person at the company it will run for one week 
 you can choose any ticket in the queue and you may have up to 5 open tickets at once 
 & gt itsec : won’t some tickets take no time and others hours 
 & gt vp : airz will assign every ticket an expected time and we’ll monitor who is doing the harder and easier work 
 & gt solitaire : when does the competition start 
 the vp looked kindly over at solitaire 
 & gt vp : monday 
 remember the winner will receive one paid week off 
 & gt me : sorry what 
 we never discussed a <unk> the vp looked at me and smiled 
 it was pure evil 
 & gt vp : got ta <unk> the troops 
 the vp walked into my office and asked me to follow 
 & gt me : a week off very generous 
 however won’t it cause chaos fighting for tickets 
 & gt vp : you’ll just have to assign fair values to each ticket… & gt me : and how do you expect me to do that without completing every ticket before handing it over to the department 
 & gt vp : simple 
 the vp opens up the ticketing software 
 & gt vp : see it has this expected time drop down menu now 
 so for this ticket… **new ticket** & gt *my password needs resetting 
 * — marketing lady & gt vp : we would select the 10 minute option 
 i looked down at the drop down menu six options where available 
 ten minutes to one hour in ten minute intervals 
 & gt me : <unk> what about things that take you know… longer then an hour 
 or an unknown amount of time 
 & gt vp : everything is fast in it nothing takes longer then an hour everything is structured 
 & gt me : wan na bet 
 the vp didn’t answer so i decided he meant yes 
 & gt me : try this ticket… **new ticket** & gt *the internet is broken we’re pretty sure its the <unk> — accounting & gt vp : that’s easy just call the isp and get them to come fix it 
 i smiled this was going to take hours i quickly did a ping check of accounting they where on the network the network had an internet connection 
 & gt me : so you’d start with… the vp picked up the phone and handed it too me 
 & gt vp : ring the isp 
 after waiting the requisite time about 20 minutes we got onto a tech from the isp 
 & gt me : just wanted to check our internet is up 
 & gt isp : sir do you get internet pages loading 
 & gt me : yes 
 thanks for your time 
 i didn’t want to mess too much with our internet because i knew it was working but the twenty minute wait was proof enough that some tickets take and unknown amount of time 
 & gt vp : airz 
 give me that 
 the vp snatched the phone off me 
 & gt vp : our internet isn’t working and you <unk> need to come down here and fix this s & amp % $ 
 & gt isp : sir we need you to run some basic <unk> 
 & gt vp : no 
 we’re our own internal it and they promise me that… 
 & gt me : vp 
 & gt vp : airz if you’re going to distract me while i’m fixing stuff get out 
 & gt me : the internet is working 
 i… 
 & gt vp : get out 
 the vp seemed genuinely mad i didn’t want have to put another it staffer though what i thought was an exercise 
 so i pushed the hangup button on the phone 
 & gt vp : what are you doing 
 i needed them to come here 
 & gt me : the internet is working in accounting 
 & gt vp : no the isp hasn’t sent someone out how is it magically working now 
 & gt me : did you ring the staffer to make sure it was actually the <unk> fault 
 & gt vp : errrr… 
 the vp lost a lot of his anger after that 
 he decided to call the staff member 
 & gt vp : hello this is it we’re ringing about the internet problem 
 & gt acc : oh my god you’re so slow 
 i submitted my ticket exactly <unk> minutes ago 
 what the hell were you doing 
 & gt vp : i … do you know who i am 
 & gt acc : someone down in it 
 & gt vp : this is the vp and i’m calling to solve your internet problem 
 & gt acc : oh… 
 the silence on the phone lasted about 20 seconds 
 & gt acc : its fixed 
 & gt vp : what do you mean its fixed 
 & gt acc : you must have fixed it 
 good job vp 
 you’re the best 
 the vp smiled when he heard that 
 he hung up the phone 
 & gt vp : see… <unk> minutes and its solved 
 & gt me : err… & gt vp : no job takes over an hour 
 & gt me : are you sure its solved though 
 the vp didn’t answer he just left 
 with a <unk> free vacation on the table and whole bunch of tickets to rank i was going to have a <unk> <unk> 
 next working as tech support for a large company with many remote workers 
 one of the reps called with problems with his broadband 
 we had sent him a new <unk> router which he should have been able to plug in and go 
 he called after not being able to get a connection we go through all the usual diagnostics and reach the point where i need to ring the broadband supplier 
 uk telco begins with v ca n't spell phone we join our hero on the second call after all diagnostics have been done by the first call and all that was needed was a appointment for bt to come out and check the line 
 cs = customer service rep & gt <unk> : so can we <unk> bt to come out then please 
 & gt cs : i just need to check a few details please what is the username and password you are using to access the router 
 & gt dervish : currently it 's set to admin and admin that 's not the problem we can access that page the adsl light is on solid so it has a <unk> the problem is happening when we give the users credentials which we know to be correct & gt cs : ok i just need to check a few more things what address are you going to to access the router 
 & gt dervish : currently connecting to it on 192.168.0.1 & gt cs : i 'm just going to ping the router to check it 's online 
 at this point the call has been going on for 20 minutes i figure it 's best just to let him get on with it 
 & gt cs : ok i 've pinged the router at 192.168.0.1 and it 's responded to the pings so we know the router is online 
 & gt dervish : sorry did you just say you pinged the 192 address 
 from your computer 
 & gt cs : yes and it responded so we know the router is online it must be some other problem 
 & gt dervish : so you pinged 192.168.0.1 from your computer and got a response 
 are you sure that that is the customers router 
 & gt cs : oh yes there was a bit of a <unk> but the router is definitely there 
 at this point there were a few incredulous questions to determine if i really was hearing him correctly yes i really was he did think that pinging 192 from his computer would somehow find the customers modem 
 i then decided that i could n't cope with any more diagnostics and arranged the bt visit and got off the phone quick 
 we have a strict policy for *all* employees 
 your company e-mail address is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> @ company 
 so al b. <unk> = <unk> @ company and <unk> <unk> fish = <unk> @ company 
 no exceptions for anyone no matter who you are 
 the nephew of someone in top manglement started work yesterday nepotism ... it will never die and his email is <unk> @ company 
 not his real email but the real one is equally embarrassing 
 must keep things anonymous 
 i got an angry e-mail from his uncle asking for it to be changed 
 i replied to uncle i did n't create the policy i merely <unk> it and his nephew 's e-mail is what it is 
 uncle did n't like that answer apparently 
 he just woke me up at <unk> <unk> well where uncle is it 's <unk> calling my <unk> cell phone to burn my ear about it 
 that phone is supposed to be used for emergencies only and i 've never been called at night on it before 
 i was polite -- do n't want to scream insults at top manglement -- but now i 'm awake and pissed 
 my boss already said that no exceptions will ever be made to the policy 
 it is set in stone 
 back to sleep ... or trying to anyway 
 <unk> 
 update : found out two crucial facts 
 1 my boss is a relative of the company president so he 'll never be fired 
 smart man the president to put a highly qualified relative in charge of the it dept 
 2 the nephew has asked for his middle name not to be used which has left him with a much more <unk> e-mail address 
 bossman approved that since we have people with no middle name so he can still use his <unk> <unk> system of naming 
 so this is a thing that started at the $ bigboxstore i was a bench tech at and it 's carried forward for years now 
 this is n't *just* the usual here 's a funny story '' or god this user is stupid '' story this is about making stuff better 
 spread this theory around because it 's awesome and it works 
 $ bigboxstore runs a private forum where techs across the company can interact easily to get help and tips whenever they run into problems they ca n't solve on their own 
 one such thread was an asking is xxx from drd a member on these forums 
 we just got a hard drive back from drd and the customer wants to know how to thank you '' 
 where the xxx was the tech 's initials and drd is the data recovery place that we send dead hard drives to for forensic data recovery 
 xxx responded with i like swedish fish '' - and the customer mailed him a large <unk> of swedish fish as a thank you 
 from this point on it became proper <unk> to expedite '' a forensic data recovery with the <unk> of candy in the package sent out for recovery 
 we would see drives sent with candy coming back in half the time of one sent without candy 
 customers would look at us like we were crazy when we told them we can expedite this $ 250 recovery for $ 3 of candy '' but they would usually say yes because if it worked it was only $ 3 and if it did n't it was only $ 3 '' 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- flash forward a couple of years : customer of mine breaks the cmos battery mount off their mobo 
 get my hands on the computer pull the board get the rma lined up with the mfg just to see if they 'll do it 
 the mfg 's normal <unk> is 2 weeks my customer was unhappy about this and i basically tell the customer that they only have themselves to blame - there are <unk> perks to being your own boss 
 i have a brain wave and think it ca n't be <unk> $ bigboxstore employees who like free candy '' so i toss a big bag of assorted candy into the box and ship it off 
 3 days later i get an email from the mfg they 've received my rma 
 next day i get an email saying my board is on it 's way back 
 next day receive <unk> motherboard 
 holy shit it totally works 
 customer is beside herself to get the computer back so fast and i was stunned 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - later that year i have a <unk> rig die 
 the pump blew catastrophically psu get 's flooded with coolant <unk> and it 's the only thing that dies probably from the pump blowing 
 this time i decide to document it 
 get the rma lined up with the psu mfg and send it out with a big bag of candy and a friendly note 
 comes back a little over a week later with a brand new psu even though mine got soaked 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - a different customer has a psu that dies from a dr <unk> getting dumped through it luckily the psu caused the dr <unk> to <unk> out the back of the case and nothing else died 
 send it out with candy and a friendly note 
 get 's rma 'd without issue - i even get an email thanking me for the candy 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - so seriously guys let 's make sending candy out with stuff the <unk> - as most of us know it is pretty thankless so getting free candy is a pretty great way to treat each other better because a little bit of candy goes a long way 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - edit thanks to the person for the gold 
 i 've never gotten any <unk> worked on a project running two different systems at different security <unk> so the users had two machines and two monitors one for each machine 
 we received a call from a user stating that they were not able to copy and paste files 
 the user was right clicking & gt copy on the mouse on one system unplugging the mouse from one machine plugging it into the second machine and then trying to right click & gt paste 
 so i worked as a repair technician for a couple years 
 we had contracts with local <unk> that had company phones computers tablets and other tech devices to provide tech support and/or in-house hardware and software repair 
 one day we got a call from a man saying that he accidentally forgot to take his work phone out of his pocket before he jumped in the ocean 
 now if you 've ever dealt with liquid damaged devices you know how dodgy they can be as far as getting them back up and running 
 sometimes they 'll get a drop of liquid in them and will never be able to come back on 
 while sometimes they 'll be lost at the bottom of a lake for a week and all you have to do is dry her out and put a new battery in and it works good as new 
 so this guy calls and i tell him the <unk> do not try to turn it on or charge it immediately power it down and take out the battery and let it sit for one to two days 
 & amp nbsp guy : ok i can definitely do that 
 also i read online that putting your phone in rice can help water damaged phones 
 me : nothing is guaranteed when it comes to wet electronics 
 but rice can <unk> moisture pretty well 
 which is why sometimes you 'll see it in salt <unk> in <unk> 
 guy : seems kind of strange but ok 
 i 'll bring her in in a few days 
 & amp nbsp couple days pass 
 and a man walks in to the front counter holding a large looking object we have cameras that display their view from the back where the work <unk> are 
 i think maybe some guy wants us to fix a printer or old computer or something 
 i walk up front and recognize the <unk> voice as the one who jumped in the ocean and i immediately think *oh for fucks <unk> & amp nbsp guy : well i read some stuff online about keeping your phone in rice and i could n't imagine how that would work 
 huh 
 well i guess you let the tech guys keep doing tech things 
 i 'll tell you what keeping this thing plugged in for two days probably ran my electric bill up a bit 
 he proceeds to open up a <unk> <unk> steam pouring out of the top as if he just unplugged it and fished out his phone from the bottom of a 4 inch deep sea of <unk> rice with a pair of <unk> 
 & amp nbsp tl dr- guy gets phone wet 
 looks online for help says to put phone in rice 
 guy puts phone in rice ... in a rice <unk> ... for two days <unk> 
 & amp nbsp <unk> wow i had no idea this would get this much recognition 
 thanks reddit 
 just wanted to clear up a couple repeated questions : 1 no the phone did not work 
 we tried to save it but we were ultimately <unk> 
 funnily enough we actually saw that the most damage inside the phone as some of you pointed out was from the ocean salt and *not* the continuous steam 
 <unk> leaves a very specific type of <unk> on the electronics and if anything the steam and pressure may have actually <unk> some of it away albeit causing many other problems in the process 
 2 yes the old <unk> rice trick does actually still work 
 does it work very well 
 meh 
 are there better options 
 absolutely 
 if you 're in a pinch and do n't have quick access to <unk> <unk> <unk> cat <unk> or a repair shop then it 's your best bet against saving anything 
 3 yes this story is 100 % real 
 you have to understand the sheer level of incompetence that people *still* have with <unk> which even though they 've been in people 's homes for 20+ years we still get all of these horror stories in <unk> 
 now translate that to smartphones tablets and laptops which have been around for less than half of that 
 you 'd be shocked at the things we saw every single shift <unk> and <unk> 
 this one was obviously the most insane and was the first to come to <unk> but do n't worry i have more stories to tell 
 whenever i get some time after work i 'll try and write up some more : cheers okay this is by far one of my <unk> stories and i tell it at work often as a <unk> of woe and caution 
 the scene 
 my retail that also does tech support for our stuff store 
 sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close 
 the players 
 and yes the details are important 
 tsv me a <unk> size 00 <unk> 
 darren customer easily <unk> <unk> guy 
 looks like the stereotypical <unk> sort with his black on black suit <unk> head etc 
 guys <unk> are as big as my head 
 jeff 
 coworker playing <unk> of the ship in the tech area 
 the game 
 dialogue is <unk> but the gist is correct 
 so i 'm doing my thing fixing user error issues the occasional software restore and so on 
 oddly quite for a sunday 
 but whatever 
 jeff : hey tsv do you think you can take one more before you go i was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah i could tsv : what 's up 
 jeff : got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it 
 no appointment 
 tsv : sure 
 bring him on 
 jeff brings over big guy 
 huge guy from my <unk> 
 i firmly invite him to grab a seat as it 's the only way i can look him in the eye for those that do n't read my retail stories i 'm partially deaf so half my hearing is lip reading tsv : hi i 'm tsv 
 dude : darren 
 not real friendly but not pissy tone tsv 
 nice to meet you darren 
 jeff tells me your phone was broken sorry to hear that 
 let 's get you set up with a new one 
 okay yeah this is how the company makes us talk darren kind of nods pulls out the phone 
 now this model has a glass front and back 
 both are shattered 
 total <unk> web 
 he hands it to me and a quick look shows that it wo n't turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red 
 yeah it 's dead time to bury this dog 
 tsv : i need to take this in the back for just a moment okay 
 darren nods again and i notice that his lip is shaking 
 dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like he 's about to <unk> 
 over a phone 
 wtf 
 so i make quick work of going to the back popping the back off the phone get the serial and look up the warranty and part 
 i put the phone back together as best i can pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off 
 back to the floor i go 
 tsv 
 okay darren 
 i was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have warranty thing so a replacement is just $ 50 
 since you have <unk> transferring your number will be a breeze since it 's on the sim card 
 i have you out of here in just a few minutes 
 darren : okay pulls out his wallet and hands me cash 
 what about my numbers and photos and stuff 
 can you get those 
 tsv : i hate this part it never goes well unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and wo n't power on so there 's no way for us to retrieve any information i <unk> myself for the yelling darren : my wife is going to kill me 
 she 's an ex seal 
 she 's good at killing people when she needs to 
 she 's going to cue a swear word filled rant that would make <unk> <unk> blush 
 mostly directed at himself 
 some at the universe in general 
 darren : i 'm an idiot 
 she told me to back up the photos 
 she said <unk> 's phones get stolen in vegas all the time 
 she kept <unk> me so i said i did it 
 she 's going to find out i lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces 
 i get him to calm down and tell me the whole story half out of a <unk> interest and half because he clearly needs to <unk> his <unk> and i 'm the priest 
 he 's not yelling or anything so okay i 'll listen darren is ex military and the last of his <unk> was getting married so as a <unk> party they went to vegas for the weekend 
 it 's not uncommon as we are in <unk> 
 you can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time 
 the night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone <unk> fountain 
 now why was darren so flipping out 
 it was n't over the phone but the data 
 see darren was the generally happy father of a baby boy 
 a three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help mom so darren and the boys could have their party 
 how nice etc 
 but before he left mom had reminded him to back up the photos the only photos of darren <unk> to the computer in case something happened to his phone 
 she had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about vegas to be bothered 
 and yes darren told his wife he did it 
 and now she was going to kill him 
 having seen darren i 'm a tad worried about a woman he 's scared of 
 now our company has a <unk> service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly 
 i figure what 's the harm in checking if he had it on 
 there 's a part of it that does save photos although it 's not on by default 
 i do n't tell poor darren about it because i do n't want to get his hopes up 
 darren : finally out of steam oh well it 's my fault 
 time to face it like a man 
 tsv : that 's the spirit 
 your wife will be mad but i 'm sure she loves you and will forgive you after a lot of grief of course this actually gets a chuckle 
 and he 's only a few weeks old you have plenty of time for taking more photos 
 darren : yeah not quite convinced he 's not a dead man i ring him up for the phone power it on 
 get to the screen for him to log in 
 at this point he just thinks he 's setting up the new phone like normal 
 and what to my wondering eyes do appear 
 but a backup made the night before his trip 
 tsv : well that 's interesting 
 there 's a backup listed in our system for your phone 
 last updated thursday night 
 darren : i do n't remember doing that 
 tsv : you probably set it up when you first got it 
 that was months ago so it 's easy to forgot 
 plus it runs on its own so you do n't have to do anything other than plug your phone into power 
 it might just be contacts and notes 
 but why do n't we try it 
 ca n't hurt 
 darren : okay if you think we should tsv : knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are i do 
 jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloaded 
 darren : hey all the apps i had are there 
 tsv : waiting to download but it knows what to get darren : if it knows that could it have my photos 
 tsv : let 's look 
 he taps the gallery app 
 darren : those are my photos 
 old photos 
 wait those are n't as old 
 those are the photos 
 you saved my photos 
 you saved my life 
 darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me 
 remember he 's got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process 
 i thought my <unk> guy was going to explode 
 darren realizes about a split second later he probably should n't have done that and puts me down and steps a <unk> space back 
 he <unk> his hand out to shake mine 
 darren : you just saved my life 
 literally 
 my wife is an ex seal 
 tsv : so you said 
 i 'm glad it worked out 
 now be sure to back up those photos when you get home darren : yeah i learned my lesson 
 i 'm never lying to my wife again 
 tldr : guy drops phone with very important photos on it into water 
 had lied to wife about them being backed up 
 i look like a <unk> cause i get them back via online backup service he did n't know he had set up 
 man vows never to lie to wife again 
 my job is done 
 previous every year 
 every darn year they host a christmas party 
 as i walked onto the executive floor i wondered how i got <unk> into planning the yearly christmas party 
 i remember being in my office then a nice lady stopped by to chat about the christmas plans then suddenly i 'm on my way to planning meetings 
 if i were not a man of science i 'd say it was witchcraft 
 the nice lady saw me walk in the meeting room door 
 & gt nice : airz 
 you made it 
 & gt me : yeah about being on this committee ... & gt nice : i 'm so glad you joined 
 we can work together to make this the best christmas party ever 
 as i wondered how you could have a committee with only two people i looked into her eyes 
 they were <unk> it was odd 
 nice too 
 & gt me : oh ... ca n't wait 
 i smiled it felt odd to smile without coffee nearby 
 & gt nice : what should the theme of the party be 
 & gt me : theme theme ... i had no experience with parties 
 usually i expect a fully <unk> bar some music and perhaps food 
 theme was an entirely new concept 
 & gt nice : it would be nice to have a theme that way everyone can dress up 
 & gt me : oh 
 i looked into her eyes again 
 the stared back at me expectantly unlike coffee they actually wanted something from me 
 & gt me : how about ... <unk> and <unk> 
 or just a color 
 maybe everyone could come as their favorite drink 
 & gt nice : no no they all seem to generic 
 i want something fun something new 
 she started staring at me again 
 & gt nice : oh my 
 & gt me : what 
 & gt nice : we should have an it themed party 
 & gt me : it theme 
 & gt nice : everyone can dress up as computers or printers 
 you can judge peoples costumes since you 're an expert on the subject 
 & gt me : haha maybe we could think of another idea ... & gt nice : i really like this one 
 i think it 'll be a winner 
 i looked at the nice lady 
 she seemed genuinely excited 
 i could have said that a company filled with user 's like ours would n't appreciate an it themed party but the words got lost in her eyes 
 & gt me : er ... if you think so 
 & gt nice : great 
 you 'll be an awesome judge 
 although as a host you better have the best costume 
 as she poked her tongue out <unk> i felt an emotion <unk> up from the inside 
 it was warm 
 is coffee an emotion 
 next i’m an information security consultant telling some clients what they need to do or implementing those solutions 
 i did an risk assessment around 2 years ago where we looked at the standards they were trying to meet scanned their networks for vulnerable machines and looked for missing controls and weak practices 
 anyway we found a bunch of high vulnerabilities <unk> almost all of them made a detailed report with some recommendations which we offered to do for them as an additional engagement 
 i went on to another engagement then another firm and forgot about them 
 until this week 
 my cell phone rings 
 i answer and get a barrage from it director andy and compliance director cheryl 
 it’s not unusual for me to have impromptu calls from clients where they expect me to know them by voice so i often listen and hope to figure out what’s going on and who it is by context 
 45 seconds into the conversation i figure out the client 
 i’m torn between telling them to never bother me again and seeing if there’s some current work to get out of them 
 i figure it’s time to tell them that i’m no longer working for the same company and neither is my old boss 
 andy : <unk> 
 who should we talk to ” me : ”well the report should be self <unk> cheryl : <unk> you explain why the same findings came up in the tests from this year ” me : ”that could be that you didn’t <unk> the <unk> andy : <unk> why i can’t stand consultants 
 we do these tests and nothing gets <unk> me : ”i was thinking the same thing 
 why aren’t you fixing anything ” cheryl : <unk> we fixing things 
 wasn’t that your company’s job ” me : ”er no 
 we likely suggested that you fix some stuff 
 we most definitely offered to implement our suggestions but you decided to save money and do it yourself 
 then you likely decided to save time by not fixing it at <unk> i figured there wasn’t much chance of getting some business out of it so i ended the call 
 i work as tech support for a web-hosting company 
 the other day my co-worker one of those <unk> country boy type guys was taking a call from a customer who was complaining about his website loading slow and having php and other syntax errors web coding is not in our scope of support 
 we just support the servers and hosting not web design issues 
 btw all our servers have identical specs and run at <unk> speeds customer : your server is slow and makes my website run slow 
 i want to be moved off my crappy server and be put on a better one 
 tech : well you see sir our server is like a bucket 
 customer : 
 tech : well we provide you with a bucket 
 it 's scrubbed clean sturdy and does n't have any holes in it 
 what you put in that bucket is up to you 
 if you take that bucket and fill it full of poo you ca n't come complain to us that you have poo in your bucket 
 we did n't poo in it 
 if you take your bucket and dump it into another bucket even if it 's a bigger bucket its still going to have poo in it 
 if you request it we can dump out the bucket clean it and give it back to you empty but it 's not our job to turn your poo into gold 
 he noted a little later he was contacted by quality control who had listened in on his call although that was a good analogy we would like to <unk> comparing our customers content to poo '' i thought he did a great job 
 edit : fixed a typo edit : march 2015 an update on <unk> bucket guy has been promoted to supervisor 
 before you start this story can be skipped if you 're looking to just read the saga 's etc 
 i looked up from the security desk 
 it was hell 
 on <unk> from the vp i was to spend some time at the security desk 
 & gt “you can’t manage someone if you don’t know what they <unk> the words rung in my ears as i looked down at my coffee 
 it was instant 
 the news quickly spread around the buildings it had desk right at the entrance 
 apparently an it member being at a desk accessible to the masses meant it was an it help desk 
 i hate it help desks 
 much like the instant coffee everyone expects instant solutions 
 a young bearded man appears 
 & gt young : hey i’m from sales on floor two 
 could i get a keyboard 
 & gt me : … this is a security desk 
 & gt young : you’ve got a keyboard there can i have that one 
 & gt me : no its attached to a pc 
 again this is a security desk 
 & gt young : okay 
 i seriously need a keyboard though we almost don’t have enough 
 & gt me : just send a ticket down to it 
 & gt young : you’re head of it right 
 & gt me : yep 
 & gt young : cool well now you know 
 okay 
 cya 
 i look at my coffee for strength 
 its instant 
 an older employee arrives & gt old : so could you get me a new password 
 & gt me : sorry a new password for 
 & gt old : i think im locked out of my email 
 & gt me : oh 
 i looked at the guy and he seemed stressed i decided to help 
 & gt me : whats your username 
 & gt old : blah @ yahoo.com & gt me : oh i mean your work email 
 & gt old : no i can get into that 
 its just the security questions on my yahoo account to reset my password i need to answer them 
 & gt me : oh well 
 sorry i can’t help with that 
 & gt old : whats my <unk> second name 
 darn it… who the hell knows that 
 & gt me : seriously i have no idea 
 & gt old : should i ask my wife 
 i look down at my coffee for the answer 
 the instant answer would be… yes 
 i feel like its a mistake but i never argue with coffee 
 & gt me : yes 
 next previous friday midday the bigp smiled at the room as he announced his latest project 
 i looked in horror at the powerpoint 
 <unk> mentor <unk> i reached out to the water in the middle of the table and poured myself a cup 
 remembering i’d already said <unk> to the idea i started to relax 
 & gt bigp : this year the school has given the children a choice in profession 
 i looked around the room and saw the head of hr beaming with delight 
 i decided to sit back in my chair and slow sip water 
 & gt bigp : we offered the children places in hr sales cleaning … 
 the bigp droned on about the different opportunities he’d offered the children 
 i started to zone out water didn’t have the same focusing abilities as coffee 
 & gt bigp : all that being <unk> 
 the bigp paused for dramatic effect 
 even i decided to tune in again 
 & gt bigp : these are the positions the children picked 
 a graph presented itself on the screen each department was listed out in a table with the number of children who wanted to go to it in a column next to it 
 i read the first line of the table : hr - 0. i looked over at the head of hr 
 she wasn’t happy i feared she may cry 
 reading the second line of the table : cleaning - 1. i was a little confused a child would pick that… i guess people like different things though… it - 3. wait 
 what 
 my glass of water started to shake 
 & gt me : oh.. <unk> these are just the students choices right 
 & gt bigp : oh yes 
 three students selected your department so that’ll be quite a handful 
 i tried taking a sip of my water but it wouldn’t stop shaking 
 & gt me : i’m afraid it… can’t have kids around 
 we’re a little too busy 
 & gt headhr : nonsense 
 i’ll come down and help if you need the extra hands 
 i looked over and caught head of hr’s eyes they looked pleadingly at me 
 & gt me : i think perhaps we should make those kids pick again or send then to hr… 
 it isn’t really a good environment for kids its very boring 
 & gt bigp : nonsense 
 look how quickly you’ve taught redcheer 
 you’ll have those kids writing programs by the end of the two weeks 
 the sound of redcheer’s name had made the vp look up in alarm 
 & gt me : <unk> weeks 
 ** i … <unk> 
 so.. i tried to take a sip of water to calm myself before continuing my hand however had <unk> 
 & gt me : i don’t think children and it mix 
 so i don’t think i want them in the department 
 vp looked <unk> from the other end of the table 
 & gt vp : kids are great with computers 
 if you’ve any trouble headhr will be right down to help 
 don’t worry 
 & gt bigp : plus we wouldn’t want to <unk> three children would we 
 the bigp gave me a knowing look 
 i decided not to respond 
 i looked around the room head of hr was smiling directly at me vp looked oddly happier 
 i sat annoyed 
 with a glass of ... water 
 next so i 'm in the office busy with some back end admin work when one of the <unk> pop 's his head into the office 
 & gt graduate : hi my phones not working 
 & gt me : ok.. what exactly is the problem 
 & gt graduate : it wo n't turn on since this morning since i dropped it 
 & gt me : wait you dropped the phone and now it wo n't turn on 
 & gt graduate : yeah it 's a bit of a mystery ... i kid you not he actually said that 
 it was a personal device anyway and i was trying to be nice but damn 
 i just sent him in the direction of the apple store 
 but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ... <unk> excuse my formatting first post on this sub so a little <unk> : ** i am in no way considered an it guy i am just fairly <unk> at sorting through most issues and i have also picked up a lot from seeing my father do it work for some of his friends some of their problems make me cringe example being one of his friends downloads everything he sees so i know my way around a basic set of issues and as such i have become the resident it guy for my floor 
 now for the story : i live as a freshman in the <unk> on campus and despite being on a floor full of honors students many of them are more inept with tech than my grandmother 
 one day a guy from my floor who will be referred to as fm came to me with an issue i have n't seen before and i 've seen some pretty dumb things 
 note that he is adamant that he can do anything so he <unk> <unk> he uses ie too all of his issues ... .you can see where this is going & gt fm : i 'm hoping you can help me with an issue i had recently i tried to fix it but it did n't work 
 & gt me : sure what 's up 
 & gt fm : well my laptop was running really slow recently and i tried a fix i saw on the internet but it did n't work 
 & gt me : preparing to run all the malware scans what was the issue 
 & gt fm : my laptop about 4 years old was running really slowly so i tried something recommended on the internet i poured water on my keyboard 
 & gt me : ... <unk> 
 why in the world would you do that you are smart enough to know that water and electronics do n't mix 
 & gt fm : but people on the internet said it worked ... & gt me : ok just let me see your laptop and maybe we can fix this 
 he then proceed to bring me his laptop and hover over my shoulder as i cleared my desk of <unk> parts and immediately remove the back plate of the laptop and looked inside he was shocked to find out that laptops can come apart 
 what i saw was a ton of dust and no moisture and looking at the front of the laptop i notice that on the surface of the machine there was no way for the water to get down into the internals because the keyboard is one solid unit at least where he poured the water 
 i told him i would need a few hours and he will have his laptop back in full working order 
 after he leaves i take a can of compressed air i had and blew out a massive amount of dust put the <unk> back on and went about finding his slowness issue 
 after running a malware scan i found a massive <unk> of malware its like he clicks on every pop up he sees and agrees to any download and after it was all cleaned off the thing ran <unk> faster than when i received it who would have guessed 
 i then did him the favor of hiding ie and installing chrome where i set google as his homepage 
 he should be much happier now with his working machine 
 i also set a password that he got to pick for windows because he did n't have one 
 after he got it back he went happily on his way to continue his netflix <unk> without even saying thank you 
 i should start charging people **edit** holy crap this post blew up did n't expect this for a tale of idiocy **edit 2** i am amazed that my <unk> untrained it work has received over 1000 upvotes thank you tfts **edit 3** holy crap thank you kind redditor for the gold i 'm the assistant it manager for a sales facility meaning i work with a group of computer illiterate folks 
 yesterday i get paged for immediate assistance in the finance office - as in <unk> to the finance office immediately 
 ** '' why they could n't have just dialed the extension for the office i do n't know 
 i get down to finance and the lady who manages all the finance paperwork is in a <unk> 
 the gm is in there and they both launch on me at once 
 she 's unable to get into her computer it 's been down for two days why did n't you call on monday 
 it 's <unk> that she get into it now 
 we 're losing sales and it 's all your fault 
 i leap into action 
 this is the moment i was born for 
 this is the situation where all my training skills and experience come into play 
 this is the time when i will save the company 
 i sit down at her desk reach down and ... press the power switch 
 the machine boots up gets to the login screen and i have saved the day 
 i am an it god 
 <unk> to add the quote to keep <unk> from going off the deep <unk> 's monday morning 
 i am in early to set up a bunch of noobies with their fancy corporate gear 
 i 'm usually very prepared and have kit ready to go by thursday <unk> morning at latest 
 however thanks to bmfh our <unk> policy known to all department heads of it requiring 2 weeks notice of any new starter so we can obtaining and set up new gear is summarily <unk> 
 of course i find this out friday evening and need to <unk> up four new laptops and get vodafone to live up some sim cards double quick for delivery monday morning 
 i 'm literally imaging the final machine when my induction group enters the room 
 i 've had no time for tea or coffee yet i 'm expecting salvation from a sympathetic co-worker at any minute 
 still best foot forward i meet my delegates with my usual <unk> smile and my welcome aboard '' handshake 
 only the air is about to <unk> 
 the familiar stench of <unk> an old woman with too much <unk> enters the room 
 she walks straight to the back of the training room and takes her seat next to a young woman 
 out of the corner of my eye i see the young woman attempt small talk to no avail 
 i get started and i 'm giving a brief introduction to the company it 
 i ca n't help be but distracted by the icy stare of bmfh piercing me like a <unk> 
 as i duly hand out prescribed equipment to my delegates she watches my every move as i dart around the room ensuring everyone gets a new toy 
 laptops in bags phones and chargers in the pocket it 's a little like christmas morning 
 in my <unk> to get my <unk> set up it seems i 've <unk> packed the wrong chargers in by mistake 
 after bringing it to my attention before i could get a word out bmfh <unk> to her feet to investigate the situation 
 holding the end of the offending charger and staring at me she <unk> the room with an <unk> well '' 
 before even being able to offer either <unk> or promises to make <unk> she takes phone and charger from noobie and walks for the door with come with me '' 
 after a solid dressing down i walk bmfh down to the stock room where she watches me hunt around in a spares box for any combination of phone and charger that would fit 
 after <unk> my first three finds as unsuitable due to being slightly <unk> she demands i instead use my company blackberry as suitable replacement 
 rather than <unk> her wrath any further i oblige <unk> with charger and wave goodbye to my lovingly <unk> toy of awesome 
 we re-enter the room like a freshly scolded <unk> i duly hand over the blackberry to noobie who feels mixed between <unk> awesome this is better than that rubbish nokia you tried to give me '' and instant pity as she totally knew what just happened 
 <unk> to continue the induction my noobie <unk> felt compelled to keep any and all <unk> questions to bare <unk> 
 not the most ideal situation i 'm sure you 'll wager 
 by the way where is that coffee 
 we make it to 12 bmfh 's face looking like she 's <unk> her teeth more and more throughout the session 
 salvation the facilities lady arrives with delegates lunch and coffee 
 blimey i need a coffee 
 yeah ... bmfh has other ideas 
 we break for lunch 
 i 'm making pleasant small talk with some of the noobies - a standard tactic in making them feel comfortable '' with support 
 the queue for the coffee jug <unk> and i walk with one of the noobies to go get myself some salvation in a cup 
 just as i pick the cup up bmfh appears by my side 
 she again orders me outside 
 she starts with stating how lunch is for the delegates only though no it 's not 
 it 's been <unk> for god knows how long to have a working lunch with the new delegates to <unk> talk shop correct any misunderstandings whatever 
 however new policy as of right now i need to return to my desk where bmfh will watch me complete some <unk> tasks she has for me 
 my co-workers are initially confused by my presence when i should be in induction but on seeing the <unk> <unk> hellhound quickly understand 
 she insists we look at the queues ... well i 'll look at the queues she 'll randomly point to various call tickets and demand why they have n't already been dealt with 
 this carries on for the next 30 minutes after which i mention i need to get back to the induction 
 for one glorious moment i thought i may have been off the hook as bmfh began <unk> her finger at another lowly employee who had dropped a mouse on the floor 
 back upstairs half the delegates have gone missing 
 it seems that our departure to some had signified the conclusion of the induction 
 a frantic <unk> the various departments and 20 minutes later we were a full team again 
 still no coffee 
 maintaining my professional demeanour against all <unk> i politely carry on with crm and best practices 
 the crm training goes down like a slow <unk> 
 every step requires clarification courtesy of bmfh like she 's picking out every little thing and <unk> it to the group 
 a one hour segment turns into a two hour <unk> and everyone has just run out of happy 
 best <unk> i cover in 20 seconds with there 's a <unk> card in your laptop bag about best practices password <unk> etc 
 read it good luck '' 
 after the delegates have left bmfh decides to reel off at me what a terrible job i 've just done and how if this is how inductions are performed it 's no wonder it support are a joke 
 ok i 've had enough 
 three days of this b**** monday morning no coffee she 's on her fourth cup i react 
 i just said firstly it would have gone a lot easier if you had n't had landed me with four delegates i was n't expecting needing me to run around and <unk> kit up from somewhere 
 secondly this is not <unk> of how inductions are usually run at all 
 and i resent your opinion that the support department is a joke '' 
 oh ... no ... you ... <unk> ... she <unk> with a calm and collected look ... yea ok ... i know it ... i 'm <unk> now 
 and where is my damned coffee 
 **the <unk> i ran into mr. <unk> no good lying git co-worker who i thought had my back 
 i just said dude ... you said you were going to ... my sentence was cut short when he gave me a complete insight into the morning 's proceedings 
 after helping me haul ass scrambling some extra kit together he had taken my cup from my drawer filled it with some lovely hot brown coffee and was on his way upstairs 
 but ... unbeknownst to him he was being <unk> 
 as he turned for the stairs the bmfh had <unk> in front like a <unk> ss officer standing in front of a little girl in a pink dress 
 demanding to know where this coffee was headed this was where she had learned of the it induction 
 in between dressing down my colleague for <unk> what and observed him as he duly <unk> away my lovely coffee and placed my mug directly into the dishwasher she had decided that she had to be a part of this induction 
 as i left for work that evening i knew i had incurred the wrath 
 i knew something was coming 
 what i do n't know ... more of the same 
 my job 
 us <unk> are very <unk> 
 my thoughts only revolved around one thing ... i need to get my <unk> in shape 
 previous i sat with coffee in hand a smile on my face and the now defunct plans for the workplace on my desk 
 i thought about framing the <unk> could make a good picture 
 i settled back into my work routine 
 oddly happy 
 ***** a few weeks later as i was hanging my new picture the phone started ringing 
 & gt me : blast it… putting down the frame and nails i walked over to the phone 
 & gt me : it… & gt vp : airz 
 the vp’s cheery tone put me on edge i wasn’t used to talking when he was in a good mood 
 & gt vp : just a quick warning the word <unk> has been thrown around my office a lot recently 
 & gt me : outsourcing … 
 i was confused what was the vp trying to say 
 & gt vp : yep oh got ta go 
 & gt me : but ... it was no use the vp had already hung up the phone 
 i looked over at the other it staff they all looked happy for now 
 about a minute later the phone ringing brought me back to my <unk> 
 & gt me : hello 
 oddly i’d hoped it was the vp calling i had so many questions 
 weird 
 i normally hate the vp calling 
 & gt bigp : airz its the bigp 
 come about an hour early for this weeks heads of department meeting 
 the bigp seemed happy to tell me this news 
 & gt me : okay whats this about 
 & gt bigp : oh i’m attending this week and we’ve a lot to get through 
 a lot to get <unk> 
 & gt me : a lot to get through 
 & gt bigp : haha so eager 
 don’t worry on friday everything will be made clear 
 the bigp hung up the phone 
 it was monday 
 next this one is going to be short and sweet 
 about 17 years ago i used to work for a small isp where our roles were everything 
 sales support retention crm administrative <unk> it was n't a bad gig working and we had a lot of fun 
 i remember taking a call for a new user who was signing up for internet 
 i ca n't remember if it was for adsl or dial-up 
 we go through the whole process of registering her name house address billing through cc plan setup 
 we then got to the creation of the account which would also be her email account 
 the conversation went something like this : & gt $ ncoch : ok we are almost done 
 now let 's pick out your username and it will also create your email email account 
 what would you like it to be 
 & gt $ user : i do n't know what can it be 
 & gt $ ncoch : it can be anything a combination of your name or what ever you like 
 please remember however that it will be your email <unk> 
 & gt $ user : oh ok i have the perfect one ... can you make it <unk> 
 & gt $ ncoch : <unk> at the screen <unk> now at the time i was 18 years old and did n't know much of the world so you can appreciate what was running through my mind 
 & gt $ user : hello ... 
 are you there 
 & gt $ ncoch : yes sorry ... ok 
 so just to clarify your email account will be *and i proceeded to spell it out* <unk> @ <unk> 
 & gt $ user : yes 
 that 's perfect 
 needless to say to this day out of the thousand email accounts i had created for that company 's client base it is the only one that i will forever remember 
 edit : typos previous the queue stretched out the door as i arrived back at it 
 normally people never came down to see us unless they wanted something done extra fast 
 colourblind saw me get back into the office and ran over 
 & gt colourblind : thank goodness your back 
 oh huh 
 & gt me : why is… there a queue 
 its 10am on a monday 
 i looked at the line carefully it didn’t seem like an angry line 
 in fact people looked happy 
 & gt colourblind : they all want stuff 
 & gt me : what do you mean they all want <unk> 
 colourblind just shrugged so i made my way over to the waiting masses 
 first person in the line was a lady with <unk> and a big smile 
 & gt spotsmile : hey 
 you’re the it <unk> right 
 & gt me : yes 
 her eyes started to look around the office at all the it equipment & gt spotsmile : i need to borrow some stuff 
 & gt me : stuff 
 perhaps she didn’t know how to say laptop 
 & gt spotsmile : okay so… this years christmas party is it themed right 
 so i just need a few it props 
 & gt me : sorry… you want to borrow it equipment which you’re going to <unk> to a party 
 i took a closer looked at the line it was filled women 
 & gt spotsmile : whatever stuff you can spare 
 & gt me : no 
 <unk> face dropped she looked rather shell shocked 
 & gt spotsmile : no 
 i just <unk> maybe a laptop 
 to carry round or even a box thing 
 & gt me : no… just… 
 i decided the entire line needed to hear so i spoke much louder 
 & gt me : no 
 everyone get out 
 you can’t take it equipment to a party 
 are you all out of your minds 
 as if realizing what a terrible idea the women started shuffling out of the office 
 except one 
 i looked her dead in the eye she looked tough but i was n't in the mood to argue 
 i just wanted coffee 
 & gt me : no… 
 no i don’t have any spare it equipment for the party 
 the lady who’d stayed gave me an odd look 
 she wore striped glasses 
 & gt stripe : i’m not here for that… remember that computer you took from head of accounting 
 yeah… i 'm gon na need you to give that to me 
 & gt me : sorry… who are you 
 & gt stripe : the computer 
 now 
 & gt me : but <unk> 
 who are you 
 ***** next please check out the comic here one of my favorites ... my company deals with some highly complex software that is a huge pain in the rear to install and configure properly and can take several days to get it working properly with all of the servers <unk> connections <unk> etc 
 so one of our more <unk> <unk> out in the field was due a new setup to use as a demo environment 
 one of the techs spent a couple of days building and verifying the environment - he does very thorough testing before shipping so he wo n't have to try to troubleshoot anything remotely 
 shortly after receiving it salesguy calls the tech : sg : hey that new machine is n't launching the software properly 
 can you fix it 
 tech : i tested that thing 5 times before i shipped it - did you make any changes to anything 
 sg : no i swear 
 i did n't change anything 
 i just turned it on launched the software and nothing happened 
 will you take a look 
 so tech logs in and <unk> a good 2 hours troubleshooting 
 after much trial and error he notices than an entire folder is in the wrong place - what should have been in c : <unk> was now in c : <unk> 
 moved it back & amp now everything is happy 
 tech : so i found your problem - looks like a folder was moved 
 are you sure you were n't doing anything to the machine 
 sg : no way man 
 they were down a level huh 
 i bet the files probably just fell during shipping 
 you should pack those machines a little more <unk> : 4 years ago i quit my part-time evenings & amp weekends it job 
 yesterday i was working late trying to finish some designs before heading home 
 at <unk> my office phone rings 
 to reach my line you need to dial from an internal phone or fight with the <unk> through 3 levels of menus regarding what kind of engineering support you need 
 it was after-hours but i answered anyway 
 we have a small number of large clients so i figured it was important especially since it was an external number 
 & gt **me : ** hello **onthemf** speaking 
 & gt ** $ salesguy : ** hi **onthemf** this is ** $ salesguy** 
 this is urgent i need you to fix my vpn right now 
 & gt **me : ** i think you have the wrong extension 
 & gt ** $ salesguy : ** no you setup my computer and now the vpn does n't work 
 i need it fixed immediately 
 & gt **me : ** sorry ** $ salesguy** you 've reached ** $ <unk> not ** $ <unk> 
 & gt ** $ salesguy** : no **onthemf** it 's ** $ salesguy** from ** $ <unk> 
 you setup my computer 
 & gt *suddenly it clicks i remember $ salesguy now 
 he worked for a client of my former employer $ <unk> 
 5 years ago i responded to a ticket about his e-mail not working 
 if i recall the <unk> steps were to enter his e-mail address and password into the outlook account wizard 
 * & gt **me : ** sorry i have n't worked for ** $ <unk> in almost 5 years now 
 who connected you to this number 
 & gt ** $ salesguy : ** i looked up your <unk> profile 
 you were the one who set this computer up you need to fix this 
 it 's costing me <unk> of dollars 
 ** & gt **me : ** again i do n't work for ** $ <unk> anymore 
 you need to call them directly for support 
 & gt ** $ salesguy : ** ** $ <unk> is on vacation until next week 
 look i need you to fix this right away 
 you did n't set it up properly so you should fix it 
 i 'm having lunch by ** $ <unk> tomorrow 
 i will drop it off before lunch and pick it up <unk> ... & gt **me : ** & lt click & gt *tl <unk> : setup a client 's e-mail 5 years ago while <unk> working at an it company 
 now demands i fix his vpn over my lunch break 
 previous bigp was the boss probably best to <unk> high on this call 
 & gt bigp : airz hello 
 enjoying the new employee 
 i occasionally forget how fast the bigp is he apparently remembers everything 
 & gt me : er actually i called to talk to you about that we’ve had a bit of a problem 
 & gt bigp : mmm 
 i glanced out the door where itsec was sitting staring at the ground head in hands 
 did colour-blind teach him that pose 
 & gt me : the head of <unk> 
 & gt bigp : he actually just called me praising your choice of employee 
 redcheer made quite the good impression apparently 
 the bigp sounded pleased and i started to worry just how much bigp knew ... & gt me : er… well as you may have heard we took the pc from the head of accounts 
 unfortunately the hard drive was <unk> destroyed 
 & gt bigp : so.. when you say <unk> & gt me : redcheer smashed it up 
 i’m unsure if it was <unk> or just stupidity 
 however i do think she is <unk> her <unk> here 
 to be honest her lack of <unk> is <unk> disturbing 
 bigp sighed into the phone 
 i looked out the door 
 redcheer was drinking coffee she seemed happy 
 & gt bigp : so the hard drive is gone 
 completely 
 & gt me : yeah 
 no chance at recovering it the platters are all broken in thousands of pieces 
 bigp sounded like he was thinking into the phone 
 he oddly didn’t seem angry 
 i could feel justice coming though i hoped he was n't too harsh 
 & gt bigp : mmm well no big loss 
 hard drives don’t cost that much right 
 lets <unk> this one upto too much enthusiasm 
 i heard you needed to securely wipe that drive from head of accounts anyway so - mission achieved 
 & gt me : isn’t that sending a terrible message to the company 
 i was expecting blood 
 i was <unk> 
 & gt bigp : she’s two hours in on her first ever day in it 
 lets cut her a little slack 
 & gt me : we actually had someone come down to it trying to take that computer 
 & gt bigp : really 
 who 
 & gt me : <unk> the bigp sounded fairly calm but with an odd edge to his voice 
 & gt bigp : mmmm did she say why 
 & gt me : nope 
 just demanded it 
 & gt bigp : oh okay 
 does n't matter now 
 bigp hung up 
 i frowned that wasn’t… what i expected 
 whilst still staring at the phone it rang 
 & gt vp : airz 
 come upto my office now please 
 oddly <unk> 
 i thought to myself as i got up out of my chair 
 grabbing a coffee i made my way up to vp’s office 
 as my hand reached out for his office door the vp’s secretary stopped me 
 & gt vpsec : airz 
 oh i <unk> annoy him too much today 
 & gt me : the vp 
 why … he seemed oddly nice on the phone 
 & gt vpsec : just a <unk> my hand pressed down on the handle i walked into the office 
 vp was smiling at my entrance 
 & gt vp : airz 
 so glad you could make it 
 & gt me : er.. hello vp 
 next month 6. the site <unk> 
 it 's the only real <unk> activity that i have as a web developer 
 working for a lawyer that does <unk> development business with other lawyers allows me the opportunity to take down a lawyer 's website 
 the hilarity that <unk> when a lawyer finds out their site was taken down is ... <unk> 
 but i 'll try : & gt boss : hey captain i need you to take down these websites today '' 
 & gt me : ok. '' & gt boss : yeah they have n't paid their bills in a couple of months and i gave them more than enough time to get back to me and they have n't so <unk> down '' 
 & gt me : no problem '' 
 zd and i tackle the effort 
 we split this task of joy so we could both get a little taste 
 afterward we sat back and waited 
 and waited 
 the phone rings caller id lets us know whose client this was gon na be 
 this was the corporate lawyer cl he 's mine 
 & gt me : hi this is captain of company '' 
 & gt cl : hi yes this is corporate lawyer name and firm my site is down '' 
 heh heh 
 & gt me : ok hold on one second '' 
 damn right i was putting that shit on speaker 
 zd gives a thumbs up 
 & gt me : um yes your site has been taken down due to non-payment '' 
 have you ever done a <unk> '' 
 same brain <unk> and high telling a corporate lawyer his services were cancelled due to non-payment 
 & gt cl : what 
 no 
 you put my site back up right now '' 
 he said it with the same <unk> tone i hear from the kids in the <unk> <unk> center all day 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry but i ca n't do that 
 you have to talk to boss and pay your bill 
 would you like me to transfer you to him now '' 
 & gt cl : no 
 tell him i 'm not paying my bill until he puts my site back up '' 
 logic ... failing 
 rage ... <unk> 
 must press mute to laugh 
 & gt me : um that 's not really how that works i can put you in touch with boss right now and you can sort this out with him '' 
 & gt cl : '' fine '' 
 i transferred the call <unk> the boss and let him deal with mr. <unk> 
 later i asked boss if he paid and if i should put the guy 's site back up boss said no 
 just threats 
 it was seemingly uneventful but then later ... phone rings 
 corporate lawyer 
 speaker on 
 & gt cl : '' now you fucking listen to me 
 if you do n't put my site back up i 'm going to sue you personally and the company 
 do you understand me '' 
 he was saying it through what sounded like <unk> teeth 
 he 's gone full <unk> 
 getting cursed at <unk> me hanging up the phone ... <unk> i wanted to 
 & gt me : '' well you do what you need to do sir 
 i still ca n't put your site backup '' 
 & gt cl : '' you can you just wo n't 
 do you know who i am '' 
 mute on 
 ok need to stop laughing 
 stop 
 i motion to zd to stop laughing too 
 ok ... ok. mute off 
 & gt me : '' yes sir i saw the <unk> on your site ... when it was up '' 
 he hung up with what i can only imagine was a force strong enough to bounce off the receiver judging by the bang followed by the sound of <unk> and a second attempt to actually hang up 
 first post & lt previous next & gt i work as a <unk> helpdesk support person for a very large company mostly taking <unk> calls and today this happened 
 & gt me : thanks for calling $ company <unk> speaking 
 insert <unk> stuff here how can i help you today 
 & gt user u : yeah i ca n't get into my $ program as soon as i launch it i get a message that says something about a file that 's hiding or something & gt me : can you please read me the error message exactly as it appears 
 & gt u : well ... i would n't really call it an error message because it 's still on my screen & gt me : trying to figure out the logic behind that well ... can you read me what the message on your screen says 
 & gt u : & lt exasperated tone & gt i <unk> you it says the file is hiding or something & gt me : can you please send me a screenshot of the error <unk> & gt u : it 's not an error because it 's still on my screen 
 & gt me : can you send me a screenshot of the message on your screen 
 & gt u : sure 
 & lt proceeds to send a screenshot flawlessly without the need for instructions of any kind & gt it was a very easy fix that simply involved <unk> into the <unk> oh and on the screenshot it said error : file not found please check your network path '' 
 it 's calls like these i wish i could be sarcastic as hell ... the error message said error in it but it 's not an error because it was ... on her screen ... <unk> elevators were not working 
 the air conditioning was occasionally working 
 the building manager was <unk> <unk> all day although no results were ever <unk> 
 unfortunately this state of affairs was causing <unk> in the office work had slowed to a crawl 
 it due to the lack of functioning lifts could only work on equipment on site 
 this led to a number of extremely angry complaints mostly <unk> around extended wait times 
 & gt sales-manager : how long 
 the sales manager had a particularly harsh tone of voice 
 it was like a death metal concert very loud and <unk> 
 i attempted to explain the problem again using my calmest voice she heard nothing 
 after a full five minutes of continuously being cut off i hung up 
 & gt me : i’ll probably regret that 
 i mumbled to myself as i sank further down in my chair 
 the list of current jobs was growing steadily 
 it was larger then i’d ever seen it 
 a knock at the door startled me out of my gloom 
 & gt pant suit : boss the ticket list ... & gt me : it’s so long 
 yes 
 & gt pant suit : you know why 
 pant suit went on to explain the current protocol was to put signs onto the broken computers since we could not move them back to the department 
 apparently people were completely ignoring the signs using the broken pc’s finding them to be broken and submitting **another** ticket 
 & gt me : so ... how many computers are **actually** broken 
 & gt pant suit : only about 10 or so 
 & gt me : just move them away to a storage room till we get lifts back 
 pant suit seemed agreeable and hurried off to various departments to go hide the broken equipment 
 i sat back in my chair and <unk> the thought of hitting delete on so many tickets at once 
 my dreams never came to fruition 
 i got a call 
 & gt sales-manager : is this what you call a solution 
 trying to just hide the problem 
 the torrent of abuse that <unk> down the phone drowned out all my hopes of a fun <unk> <unk> 
 sales manager’s rage <unk> that of a <unk> man learning that his gym was closed for the day 
 & gt sale manager : ... and don’t think i’ve forgotten you hung up on me 
 & gt me : listen ... sales manager didn’t 
 & gt sales-manager : i’m not letting pant suit leave till you send someone up to fix the problem 
 my efforts to explain that pant suit could probably fix the issue herself fell on deaf ears 
 i heard in the background sales-manager ordering pant suit to sit and wait 
 & gt sales-manager : send someone to fix this *now* 
 she hung the phone up on me 
 a hostage situation 
 i started trying to find the tickets sent from the sales department to make sure i had the correct equipment to fix it 
 another knock at the door startled me for a second time 
 & gt messy : boy she was loud 
 we could hear that whole conversation all the way out here 
 & gt me : i think the air-con is out in sales again so they’re going a bit <unk> 
 & gt messy : weird how everywhere else the air conditioning is broken but here it’s ... fine 
 i laughed to myself as i looked towards the it plant room key 
 alas the building manager had recently lost his copy 
 & gt me : yeah weird ... & gt messy : so i was wondering can i take that call 
 & gt me : err they’re fairly mad 
 & gt messy : don’t worry i’ll fix it 
 messy <unk> out of the department with a confident smile 
 i relaxed back in my chair <unk> messy as an employee he did seem up for anything 
 it was only a few minutes later that my phone started ringing 
 & gt messy : she won’t stop shouting 
 also i may have forgotten my tools 
 i could hear the screams of frustration in the background 
 sales manager demand the phone from messy who didn’t even put up a fight 
 & gt sales-manager : he couldn’t fix it 
 says he needs to go get parts 
 why didn’t he bring them with him airz 
 why 
 i’m sick of waiting for it to get its act together 
 these two can’t leave until this is fixed 
 & gt me : you can’t hold people hostage 
 just let pant suit go and messy will go get the parts it’ll be fixed soon 
 & gt sales-manager : let them go 
 no 
 send someone else up with the parts make sure they’re competent 
 send redcheer she’s good 
 & gt me : redcheer isn’t here ... & gt sales-manager : still 
 how long does a holiday take 
 i didn’t really know the answer to that 
 redcheer’s idea of communication was to request leave with a question mark on the time period 
 & gt me : what parts are needed to fix the computer 
 & gt sales-manager : do i look like a tech to you 
 work it out 
 she hung up 
 the sound of the phone being slammed into the receiver made my head <unk> 
 that wasn’t very nice i thought to myself 
 looking around the office i considered just carrying up a new computer 
 it wasn’t worth it 
 too many stairs 
 i decided to just go face sales manager myself 
 she had clearly gone off her tree 
 after walking the flights of stairs and arriving in the office i realized the problem 
 it was boiling 
 everyone was boiling 
 sweat was dripping from all the employees it was like working in a volcano 
 fans weakly pushed air about the place hot <unk> air 
 wet towels were being liberally applied to <unk> ice had become a <unk> <unk> 
 & gt sales-manager : finally took you long enough 
 get to work 
 sales-manager pointed at a computer with a broken sign my two techs sat meekly nearby 
 & gt me : i can’t i don’t have the parts 
 & gt sales-manager : oh for goodness sake 
 the sales manager’s face <unk> up clearly about to launch into another tirade 
 & gt me : messy pant suit 
 please leave and get on with your work 
 & gt sales-manager : they’re not ... & gt me : go 
 i had cut off the sales-manager and waved them out the door 
 messy who clearly had a thing for sticky situations wanted to stay but pant suit was pushing him out the door 
 as i watched them leave sales-manager recovered 
 & gt sales-manager : i can not believe this 
 that computer has been sitting here broken for hours now 
 is this what you call service 
 & gt me : calm down 
 & gt sales-manager : no 
 the sales department had stopped even in the boiling heat people seemed <unk> towards <unk> 
 oddly sales-manager didn’t continue she seemed to just run out of steam 
 i could understand it was just too hot 
 & gt me : now listen do you want the air conditioning fixed 
 & gt sales-manager : what 
 no 
 i want this computer fixed 
 & gt me : oh ... we can’t do that until we have the lifts working 
 good bye 
 i <unk> on the spot and started <unk> towards the stairs whispers of air conditioning and working swirled throughout the office as i walked away 
 & gt sales-associate : you can fix the air conditioner 
 many pleading eyes looked at me like starved <unk> being offered a juicy piece of meat all hoping for one thing 
 only the sales-manager didn’t look hopeful 
 & gt me : i can you just need to get the key to the plant room <unk> the mains switch on the air conditioner to <unk> 
 & gt sales-manager : no 
 it is useless and never fixes anything 
 this computer has been broken for ... .. clearly mad with power the sales-manager went off on another rant about it and its flaws 
 i didn’t stay for its conclusion i pushed the door open and left 
 when i arrived back in my office my phone was already ringing 
 & gt sales-associate : my manager has banned us from calling it but ahh ... where exactly is that <unk> <unk> 
 i gave the sales-associate as detailed instructions as i could it was fairly distinctive 
 after the call i sat back in my chair and took a sip of coffee 
 no calls from sales anymore 
 sweet 
 my phone rang about half an hour later 
 it was from the sales-manager i could hear the sounds of <unk> air conditioning in the background 
 & gt sales-manager : sometimes people say things in the heat of the moment ... i got a little er ... hot headed you know 
 & gt me : sure ... was this ... & gt sales-manager : sorry about that whole thing 
 an actual apology 
 i had n't ever heard one so i could n't be sure 
 i decided to be nice since she 'd given me the rare gift of an apology 
 & gt me : i’m just glad you’ve cooled off 
 & gt sales-manager : so ... you’ll fix it when the lifts are working 
 & gt me : that’s the plan 
 how civil i thought to myself 
 i was almost tempted to go fix everything in that department now 
 considering how much more reasonable salesmanager was being 
 plus she did give me an rare real apology ... .. maybe i *should* fix all their stuff 
 & gt sales-manager : you don’t happen to know where the switch for the lifts are ... do you 
 nope 
 nope nope nope 
 \**ring*\* \**ring*\* & gt me : you 've reached technology this is <unk> how can i help you 
 & gt t : i need help 
 i ca n't get to my email 
 & gt me : alright could you look to see if ... & gt t : ..i 'm actually in a hurry class is starting could you just come take a look 
 & gt me : it would actually <unk> & gt t : oh got ta go sorry bye 
 <unk> 
 might as well see if i can remote into their system 
 <unk> it 's offline 
 i suppose i was going to that building soon anyhow stopping by really would n't be a hassle for me 
 & gt me : i 'm here to see what 's wrong with your email 
 & gt t : oh great 
 it 's right over here 
 monitor 
 ... off 
 printer 
 ... off 
 computer 
 <unk> 
 red light on <unk> 
 not important those lights never work 
 & gt me : it looks like there 's no power to your desk 
 & gt t : is that why i ca n't get to my email 
 ... these people are teaching our children yesterday i got a work order from corporate telling me to call a store and tell them they are doing their invoices wrong 
 the problem 
 apparently someone in the store did n't know how to post invoices and was deleting them instead 
 then called us to complain because their invoices were <unk> case had been sent up to corporate to investigate since l2 did n't see any obvious problems either 
 so i call the store and let them know what corporate had found 
 the person on the other line was the one that handles the invoices and she <unk> she did n't delete anything 
 i remote into the server and there 's an invoice waiting there to be posted 
 i ask the user to post it so i can see what the issue may be 
 she hit the d key 
 the key that on this page is the shortcut for delete 
 she thought it was short for display it clearly says on the page d delete 
 i had to work hard to keep myself from laughing while i was wrapping up the call 
 but i did have a good laugh when i hung up 
 first post so please be gentle 
 i work for a large pc manufacturer doing technical support on contracts for business customers and the occasional end user and all of the systems that i support are business class 
 last week i spoke to a customer out of pa who spoke exactly like <unk> <unk> 
 he starts by telling me that his monitor on his laptop wo n't change brightness 
 after more <unk> more info from him it sounds like he recently reinstalled windows 
 sounds like a driver issue with the hotkeys 
 i start to direct him to download the drivers and ask which version of windows he 's running 
 windows 7 home basic 
 now none of our business class pcs come with that 
 in fact we offer professional on every one 
 remember he 's got the <unk> <unk> ... & gt <unk> : sir where did you get this copy of home basic 
 did your company require it for some reason 
 or maybe school 
 how did this happen 
 & gt **rocky** : yeah well uh i got it and installed it myself 
 & gt <unk> : why did n't you just use the version that came with the system windows 7 professional 
 & gt **rocky** : 'cause i use it at home 
 it 's hard to argue with that logic 
 at least it was just a driver and we got it installed and working 
 working for the $ bigboxstore yielded enough strange issues that nothing <unk> me anymore - well computer related stuff does n't 
 i happened to be working the counter one day at the beginning of my shift when ... a friendly old guy fog brought in his fairly new desktop and said that it would n't boot up today and he was wondering if i 'd take a look at it 
 i plug it in and it fires right up 
 he says you must be magical '' and leaves happy - i like this guy already because whenever i do n't feel like explaining how i fixed something to a customer i just tell them i 'm magic '' 
 he comes back a few hours later 
 <unk> his desktop <unk> him 
 i 'm now confused 
 & gt fog : well i got home plugged everything back in and it still would n't boot up 
 & gt me : define would n't boot '' for me 
 & gt fog : well i push the button everything <unk> then nothing 
 no beeps no lights nothing 
 this guy actually answered all my follow ups before i asked them - he has to at least know something of computers 
 awesome 
 so i quickly hook it up back up and it boots like a <unk> 
 i shut it down test the psu check for loose connections nothing 
 it 's perfect 
 it 's a year old ish and there 's no dust no nothing 
 i pronounce his computer fine and suggest maybe try moving the plug that his surge protector is plugged into 
 either a different plug on that outlet or preferably grab an extension cable and plug it in on a different circuit because maybe there 's something wrong with his house 's wiring would n't be the first time 
 i also add that if he 'd like we can send a $ specialist out to his house to diagnose it there but it 's x amount of dollars 
 & gt fog : no no 
 <unk> going to get to the bottom of this 
 & gt me : well if it still does n't work and you have to come back bring everything you can with you 
 surge protector peripherals monitor whatever you can carry 
 it 's a slow day and this is a weird one - i like weird 
 he seems more than happy with this and leaves 
 comes back a few hours later very end of my shift and $ bigboxstore is quite dead 
 this time he has a cart filled with stuff and a grin on his face - he 's sure we 'll get it this time 
 so about 20 minutes later we 've got his whole desk wired up on our counter and a little bit of an audience - my coworkers in their infinite boredom wanted to see the <unk> going on in my department 
 so i start stepping through everything end to end everything checks out 
 power strip is good power cable is good everything 's plugged in hit the power switch - *twitch* what the hell 
 so i unplug everything except the power cable and speakers from the back of the computer and plug in my trusty kvm on the usb only since it worked earlier 
 it boots up hear the windows <unk> sound shut down using the keyboard 
 plug his monitor in 
 boots up 
 plug in all his usb peripherals 
 boots up 
 plug in his ps/2 keyboard 
 *twitch* what in the actual hell 
 after i 'm done scratching my head i run my hand down the keyboard 's cable ... there 's a nice warm spot right on a discolored bend in the cable 
 & gt me : you would n't happen to have a pull out keyboard tray on your desk would you 
 & gt fog : how 'd you know 
 & gt me : there 's a short in the cable right here 
 point to the bend 
 have him feel the warm spot 
 -- direct quote -- & gt fog : *well i 'll be a mother <unk> 
 * you are magic because i 'd have never thought of that 
 i crack up laughing because friendly old people are the best 
 pack up all his crap sell him a new keyboard and send him on his merry way 
 tl dr customer is a <unk> and i 'm a <unk> arrived for work the next day this time <unk> my morning 's requirement for coffee before leaving the house 
 i was on the late shift so i could afford the luxury of adding breakfast 
 for some reason i was <unk> by the events yesterday offered 
 i arrived to find a deathly quiet it department 
 sadly i had begun to expect this when angie had <unk> her usual words of wisdom on some poor unsuspecting fool 
 i duly logged into my pc fired up touchpaper and began the arduous task of setting up some <unk> for the day 
 i was surprised to hear a new type of noise from angie 's direction 
 rather than the <unk> voice of <unk> <unk> yet another soul or the heavy bleak silence that accompanied her stare there was <unk> and the sound of humans talking 
 i looked over to see angie discussing in depth the virtues of a nearby starbucks with some finance hag 
 on the one hand we were all pretty shocked that angie seemed to be demonstrating a more human side to her character 
 though given her <unk> with finance hag ... see it support and finance were situated directly next to each other 
 some time ago we had all been <unk> into offices beautifully adorned with departmental <unk> which happily contained our respective <unk> and existances 
 at some point some middle manager in a fit of <unk> genius decided to implement an entirely <unk> strategy and had all walls removed 
 as far as i can see it served to merely <unk> the <unk> of good <unk> make good <unk> '' and that destroying the efficiency of aircon in the height of summer only adds to tensions 
 finance had repeatedly become irritated with its occasionally walking through their area '' as they would usually have varying <unk> hanging around for traveling business reps - it seemed walking even near their area was suddenly deemed a security risk - and were constantly angered by the fact we had a lot of foot traffic and a lot of equipment which invariably made its way to us 
 really - it support does not suit open office especially next to finance <unk> 
 suffice it to say there had previously been a <unk> and it support were mandated by up on high to keep a three desk distance from any finance team members a problem as they were forever <unk> on our space with temps filing systems and new <unk> meaning we had to constantly move and shrink 
 <unk> they had enforced a <unk> rule whereby you could only have three pieces of equipment on your desk at any time 
 as the average monitor and system unit accounted for two of these you can imagine what a struggle this was should anyone show up with a non functioning laptop and accompanying <unk> <unk> 
 our constant <unk> of any post-room space and the need to create a <unk> in the stock cupboard was a testament to what a poor relation it support really was in the company 
 though our jobs were now more difficult in that we had to maintain a presence outside whilst actually getting to work in a cupboard was a constant struggle we all remained <unk> and chipper in our existances 
 nevertheless angie was evidently on first name terms with finance wench 
 with pleasantries exchanged off they set to the local coffee <unk> to embark on their <unk> challenge of attempting every single combination of coffee type they could think of - not forgetting the ominous stare at support personnel as she passed 
 finally 
 the coast was clear - we could take a breath 
 being the last one in my colleagues were quick to ask jon6 ... have you read your email yet ... 
 well no actually ... and there it was 
 retribution the storm of the bmfh 's reign was upon us 
 angie had decided that during the course of the day she would be performing ticket reviews on an individual basis 
 middle-aged family guy mafg was on the early shift 
 he had obviously already been the meat grinder angie 's special treatment 
 of course we were now <unk> on his response to find out what went down 
 it soon became clear when he <unk> and <unk> his ie window to reveal several <unk> results 
 wow it went that well then 
 mafg was n't a slacker not by a long shot 
 in fairness there were <unk> but he was n't one 
 and it looked like the wind had been knocked well and truly out of his sales 
 he began to tell us how angie had spun her web 
 she had a printed list of his open tickets and several examples of his closed tickets 
 she had initially allowed him to dig his grave so it seems with a few innocent cases until launching into an all-out <unk> move to demonstrate terrible <unk> on within his daily work 
 this invariably was forcing him to reopen old tickets she was dissatisfied with despite no suggestion from the customer of that being the case 
 that 's when it hit me 
 as he talked about the meeting the fact that things were printed angie has no idea where the printers even are the fact that she was able to search the ticketing system for tickets at all ... it 's obvious 
 there is a mole ... that 's all there is to it ... someone here is working against us all 
 someone had to have provided angie with a method of <unk> closed tickets 
 someone has to have shown her how to use the printer 
 the cloud of suspicion was very much there 
 i knew it ... and i could sense maybe some others knew as well 
 is there a <unk> in our midst 
 after our team <unk> of angie 's impact to date we were left deflated and totally unmotivated 
 we returned to stare into the <unk> of the computer monitor hoping that salvation lay within 
 i duly opened my outlook calendar 
 sure enough ... jon6 tickets review at <unk> ... .. right at the start of my designated <unk> 'd lunch break ... ok angie ... you foul smelling b**** ... it 's on ... **so did this really happen 
 ** yes 
 this is an <unk> as i remember account of a bitch manager from hell that i endured over a 15 month period 
 the story indicates a much shorter <unk> but i only have time for so much writing 
 in reality angie <unk> to death several its <unk> cost a few people their jobs and was an overbearing terrible person 
 all of this led to her ultimate er <unk> **how many parts are there going to be 
 ** to be honest i had no idea when i started writing how many parts there would be 
 i just started initially thinking 3-4 parts at most 
 as i found people started enjoying it i just wrote more 
 in truth angie was such a nightmare that if i took to time to recount every single thing she did there would have been near on 500 parts 
 at some point given i have other <unk> to adhere to this needed to end sadly 
 i decided to <unk> my writing towards the ultimate conclusion of angie’s reign 
 **are you a <unk> 
 ** nope 
 not professionally 
 i’ve never felt compelled to sit down and write anything this <unk> before 
 i’ve been writing <unk> for years and used to trying to fit syllables to <unk> restrained to only a few available lines to get the point across 
 i play metal though – so like anyone cares about the <unk> so long as there’s a few <unk> picked crowd pleasing lines 
 <unk> - walk 
 **i suspect he is in reality british 
 ** yep… sorry about that : **why didn’t you just quit 
 ** it had been my third it support role 
 in reality there’s no such thing as a nice it support role 
 they’re all <unk> hostile places to be and i would urge anyone to get out as soon as possible it 's a slow suicide by telephone 
 my take on it support is that it is the one area that’s simple to get into but difficult to dig out of 
 managers like angie are just all too common in this field 
 if i had just quit as i managed to prove to myself when i did change jobs moving from one <unk> support role to another <unk> nothing 
 it’s just the same thing different place 
 ** ... go to her boss 
 explain how she 's <unk> negatively on productivity and on your team 's mental <unk> there is such a thing as <unk> in your own back yard 
 no upper manager wants to be bothered by some <unk> <unk> from some <unk> support role going on about how much he hates his boss 
 it’s a fast track out the door i can assure you 
 **the <unk> should just go ahead and turn these into a show 
 ** hahaha i am open to offers 
 **i would have flipped my desk and said f*ck it i 'm done '' i am amazed with your amount of patience throughout this matter 
 ** i was brought up to be very patient 
 but the fact i had a mortgage to pay a car to keep running various other responsibilities i couldn’t be that flippant about it 
 ** i do n't understand why the entire department does n't walk out 
 that would get the attention of angie 's <unk> 
 ** this is a rather <unk> ending but the reality is everyone has bills to pay 
 i’d wager such a bold move would fall foul of its <unk> when this reality would dawn on everyone 
 in truth we were all <unk> though 
 ** 3 seconds 
 ** do i owe you a new spring for your <unk> key 
 **i love you jon6 
 ** awww <unk> 
 <unk> this series ends up with a <unk> joke i 'll be both angry and <unk> you don’t know how <unk> this was to put up - even for just five minutes 
 though i hope it didn’t end that way for you 
 **so just to be clear this all took place in the <unk> <unk> 's and jon6 was <unk> at the time correct 
 ** it’s safe to say i was about <unk> and this was around <unk> i don’t want to say much more than this though anonymity and all 
 **how does it feel to have so many people hanging on your every word jon6 
 ** odd 
 but i 'm pleased i provided such entertainment - and i hope i did n't get anyone in trouble with their bosses 
 **i feel like <unk> at the beginning of portal 2. all that hard work and the feeling of victory at escaping the <unk> <unk> of <unk> only to find yourself back in the <unk> of hell once more 
 the evil thing is still alive and kicking and you 'll have to deal with her all over again 
 ** luckily i never crossed paths with her at all after that 
 but it’s the one big lesson of the corporate world 
 credit travels up blame travels down 
 the higher you are the harder it is to fall 
 <unk> ... guys 
 we got to the end 
 we did it 
 ** we sure did… my large diversion from doing coursework has also <unk> i’m <unk> a very hard easter weekend ahead to catch up 
 but i’ve enjoyed writing for you guys 
 <unk> loses my <unk> i would hate to be thought of as someone who hates women 
 for one they’re lots of fun ok i admit i had to google <unk> '' 
 the correct british <unk> is male <unk> pig '' joking aside i feel an explanation may be required to this line of questioning 
 my account describes the situation endured by all at that time i tried to paint a picture of the characters involved as best i could 
 where you can define your own definition i would welcome you to do so 
 in some cases my brief description of <unk> blonde <unk> should be enough for you to paint your own picture 
 however angie and her gang were such an uncommon abnormal collection i felt that to not describe their mannerisms and <unk> would have done them an injustice 
 similarly roland’s <unk> appearance just seemed to burn anyone who set eyes on him 
 bhit i think was also subject to rather <unk> description 
 i’ve had some excellent female colleagues managers and so forth so i would hate for it to be assumed i have a problem with women in power

 back then i was still relatively new on tech support 's senior staff at the telco i still work for 
 nowadays here you can have 1-on-1 <unk> tech support in 3 clicks and it 's pretty standard <unk> 
 back then the company was just exploring the possibility of expanding beyond <unk> and eventually orders came down from the vp 's office on how to set it up 
 then my <unk> told us what would happen with a frown 
 a nice-looking portal would go live on our website but it would be just a skin for a irc chatroom 
 people would come in write about their problems and some frontline staff reading them <unk> simultaneously taking <unk> would direct them to either call tech support for the harder issues or type solutions if seemed like a quick fix 
 & gt $ colleague : so there will be some kind of system put in place to ensure customers ca n't see each others requests and our frontline staff 's answers right '' 
 & gt ex boss : no ... just a irc chatroom with a skin 
 we have to leave it wide open too it 's not like we can only let +v people ask a question '' 
 everybody in the room either facepalmed or stared at the table 
 & gt $ colleague : you ca n't be serious '' 
 & gt ex boss : i know they 'll be chatting with each other and some will get angry and stuff but our staff will be in there and there will be a <unk> able to automatically kick for obscenities and such 
 the <unk> came up from up above i ca n't do much and it 's just for a trial period '' 
 & gt bytewave : could we at least moderate the channel and have customers first pm a <unk> with their issue 
 once they seem <unk> about their situation give them +v '' 
 & gt ex boss : no that 'd be about as ineffective as using only pms <unk> '' 
 & gt bytewave : and what 's wrong with that 
 only using pms 
 why would we want a chatroom where they can talk to each other '' 
 & gt ex boss : the vice-president expects that in a crisis such as a significant outage we can be <unk> more effective 
 users asking redundant questions will realize their issues are already answered and will ... '' & gt bytewave : okay sure in the best of <unk> 
 but this is not going to end well 
 angry customers will work each other up there 'll be rants stuff will go public people will hold us <unk> for things outside our control and i 'm sure i 'm just scratching the surface '' 
 she basically agreed with us but it was out of her hands 
 the chatroom and the web interface was being designed by internal it and the actual interactions with customers were to be handled by frontline staff below us 
 tsss was simply supposed to help them with tough calls about <unk> technical questions 
 but we all left the room knowing no good could come out of this 
 ... some weeks later once this was live ... my boss came to my desk looking crushed after reading the piece of paper in her hands 
 & gt ex boss : look there are a few customer complaints with the new chatroom some threat of a lawsuit other stuff 
 can you look at the logs for the last two days and tell me if there 's anything we need to be worried about 
 one of our employees filed a grievance about it too - there 's also a redacted copy of that in this file 
 so please send me your findings in writing and cc the union steward '' 
 ... i was surprised that she did n't ask me to come to her first 
 technically her request was perfectly proper but it 's rare that supervisors do n't at least ask for a heads up before we send work product to the union 
 so i guessed she <unk> what would follow to happen 
 i looked at the logs not surprised one bit how badly it went wrong 
 customers were spending more time <unk> each others belief that our support was horrible because they had issues than trying to get them fixed 
 since there 's all kinds of people out there and they are less inhibited in a chat room than they are on the phone there were insults swears all caps and even threats thrown around liberally 
 i made a call and learned frontline staff <unk> the <unk> were still waiting on official instructions on how to react when customers were being abusive - and that so far their instructions were only to <unk> to legal any situations where criminal threats or <unk> are relevant 
 this was being treated like alpha testing even though real customers were on the other end and it was on our official website 
 in short they allowed any <unk> customer to visit an open chatroom where the <unk> were supposed to let anything slide unless a customer issued <unk> <unk> 
 moderate 'i 'll kill you but do nothing if they merely said 'i wish you die ... with our logo on top 
 the time i spent looking at those logs truly hurt my faith in humanity 
 i say this despite having manned frontline phones for two years 
 the stuff in that chatroom was insane 
 the employee who had filed a grievance had to deal politely with customers implying she 'd be <unk> <unk> all over a 4 hour network outage she had no control over - because the threat was <unk> 
 people in there were at each other 's <unk> too - like in any poorly <unk> angry irc chatroom - and then blamed *us* for the resulting chaos 
 this thing had just been rolled out but even the early <unk> went in there willing to <unk> out at just about anyone 
 there were customers with rf issues threatening lawsuits in writing if we did n't fix it remotely even though their problems were due to <unk> splitters in their own houses 
 customers getting into <unk> with each other because they wanted to do *something* whenever we were n't responding quickly enough 
 customers working each other into 'joint lawsuits plans at 4am when we were n't around nobody had ensured the chatroom would be closed when the staff was offline 
 employees threatened or mocked for <unk> to the project 's ridiculously strict policies 
 even one instance of two customers starting to cyber in the damn public tech support chatroom 
 the stuff i read in the logs made me lose my cool so i wrote one of the <unk> emails of my career 
 our union guarantees a fair degree of job security and my boss did specifically request i cc the union stew 
 union employees have the luxury of being able to speak the truth to power without consequences - as long as we 're right at least 
 so late that night - while being paid at overtime rates - i spent two hours <unk> a huge <unk> - longer than any tale i ever published here 
 i sent it to my boss the department 's director the union stew the union executive and ccc 'd the employee who put in that grievance calling the whole thing a <unk> amateur hour and a serious threat to both the corporation 's and the union 's interests 
 i generously <unk> lengthy parts of the crazy stuff written in that chatroom 
 i knew i was taking chances by sending an angry email this broadly but it still worked out 
 before business hours the next morning union execs had a talk with upper management and within the day the chatroom was offline and they were working things out including the grievance 
 for almost two years afterwards we simply had no chat service 
 once we launched one again it was strictly one-on-one and serviced by dedicated employees who were n't multitasking 
 that 's the only way to do it properly 
 it should n't need to be said but never put multiple angry customers in the same chatroom before you 've even had a chance to address their issues 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 i work service desk at a law firm 
 the most common calls i get are how do i do x in office application '' 
 generally i have the answers <unk> in me but occasionally i 'll get a new one and have to google it 
 today i had an attorney call in : attny : how do i change text direction in excel '' 
 me : one moment '' <unk> to search google for change text direction in excel '' * attny : are you googling it 
 i 'll beat you '' 
 me : i have the steps ... '' attny : interrupting i do too *proceeds to read the steps from google 
 * thanks '' 
 *click* edit : formatting i 'm busy wrestling with a situation that has just <unk> up as our main printer has suddenly and catastrophically failed 
 the phone is glued to my ear as i 'm talking to the suppliers engineer as he 's instructing me to do an engineer reset and perform various other tasks 
 it 's not a simple thing 
 up to my desk <unk> my favourite sales drone a girl called sara not her real name 
 she patiently waits for five minutes and the second the phone goes down she speaks 
 & gt sara : you busy 
 & gt me : extremely 
 we 've lost the printer and i need to get it running or the paperwork run will have to be done manually 
 & gt sara : i 've got an urgent issue 
 one of the suppliers is asking for a volume of material used in our product that they ordered 
 can you look at it please 
 & gt me : you can send it to me but i doubt i 'll get time to do this today 
 & gt sara : it 's super important as this is part of our contract with them 
 if we do n't supply this information they 'll go elsewhere 
 & gt me : right now if i do n't get this fixed no product will be made next week 
 losing <unk> is a bit more important than potentially losing a customer 
 send me the details and i 'll see what i can do 
 after condemning the printer and picking a new shiny one i sat down at my desk and wrote a quick script in our app to produce the required report 
 i gave sara access to this and went up to see her 
 & gt me : ok i 've written you a function that will allow you to respond to these messages yourself 
 you do n't need to do anything technical simply click this icon enter their email address in the top field add the quote numbers in the box below and click go 
 & gt sara : what does it send them 
 & gt me : it gives them a breakdown of the volume of <unk> in each item and for each quote and as a whole 
 it also adds that the volume is weight / <unk> based and therefore might not be completely accurate however it 's the best we can manage 
 a week later : & gt sara : i need to send out some material volumes again 
 can you ... & gt me : use the icon i gave you 
 & gt sara : but i do n't understand how it works 
 & gt me : you do n't have to 
 just follow the instructions and you 'll be fine 
 two weeks later : email from customer forwarded by sara 
 & gt material volumes request 
 please can i have the material volume for the following delivered products please ... i reply to sara with : & gt me : please use the app i wrote for you 
 & gt sara : but you 're the technical person 
 i do n't understand this whole volume thing 
 & gt me : 
 needless to say that i emailed her copying in her boss and the md with instructions and where the demarcation line between her job role and mine <unk>

 hot off the <unk> - user <unk> unbelievable act of stupidity 
 that 's right folks it 's time for another round of america 's funniest computer users '' 
 our user heroine today is a billing specialist - one of the lovely middle-aged women in the doc 's office who verify your insurance and convert the doctor 's diagnosis into billable codes 
 she 's also completely clueless as to how a computer works 
 we <unk> her old tower finally killing off another xp machine and dropped in a new one last night 
 we reconnected her existing dual monitor setup and left a note to call us in the morning to get any old files or programs we missed migrated over 
 on the phone this morning as we 're copying her <unk> over : & gt user : by the way sgtk my second monitor is n't working '' 
 & gt sgtk : ahm ... it looks like it 's connected and detected plus my remote access app is showing me two monitors 
 are you sure it 's not working '' 
 *i move the mouse to the second <unk> & gt user : it 's just showing the mouse over there - it 's not bringing up any information on the second monitor '' 
 <unk> & gt sgtk : ah - the monitor 's working fine 
 you just have n't put anything over there yet '' 
 & gt user : i ... have n't put ... how do i do that '' 
 <unk> blink <unk> & gt sgtk : *as i <unk> err - you just need to drag a window over there '' 
 & gt user : <unk> 
 i forgot about the dragging ... '' if you 'll all excuse me i need a coffee refill 
 i work for a rural telco troubleshooting internet tv and phone issues 
 there is a customer who is so unbelievably stupid i thought she was just <unk> us the first few times she called in 
 i am going to paste in an internal ticket word for word 
 you can feel the tech 's <unk> ... & gt customer can not display <unk> 
 **** shows modem offline 
 asked customer to look at modem customer says she does not know what that is 
 describe modem to her she locates *** 
 ask her to power cycle she says she does not know how to 
 tell her to unplug the electric cable customer says she does not know what that is 
 advise electric cable is the only cable plugged into a wall outlet customer says she does n't know what that is either 
 tell her its the only one that looks different than the others customer claims she does n't know anything about wires ... & gt okay what lights are on 
 customer says no lights are lit 
 modem must not be powered up 
 ask customer to look at her wall outlet she says she does n't know what that is 
 & gt ask her if there is a power strip she says she does n't know ask her if there is a strip of things with plugs 
 yes 
 & gt okay is there a red switch 
 yes 
 ask her to push it she asks me how to do that 
 tell her to literally press it with her hand and then she finds an ac adapter that is not plugged in 
 & gt customer managed to plug it in and the modem worked properly 
 <unk> today was my first day at my new job : part time as an <unk> tech for a <unk> tech support company take a guess 
 it happened to be an extremely busy day so they immediately put me to work on data transfers 
 simple stuff- pull the old hard drive and transfer user files to the new one 
 one of the <unk> stayed with me and had me walk him through the process for the first computer i have no previous job experience in this field so they were <unk> <unk> 
 100 <unk> pulled off an old but still functional drive 
 easy as it gets 
 after windows reported it 's success i open up the user file on the new computer to double check 
 contacts : empty 
 desktop : empty 
 downloads : empty 
 documents music <unk> all empty 
 finally i reach my videos '' 
 sure enough just short of 100 gigs in that file 
 all of it porn 
 i turned to the tech <unk> me 
 ... someone actually paid $ 100 for a data transfer ... just to save their porn '' 
 he smiled sadly at me and replied : welcome to tech support kid '' 
 this was about ... oh ... 12 years ago in my tech support days 
 i get this call from a lawyer in <unk> and his computer is down for the count 
 he has a next business day warranty but this is friday night 
 so his parts wo n't ship out until monday arrive until tuesday and i told him he 'll be getting a call from a contracted repair technician on tuesday 
 & gt '' i have a next business day warranty so i am going to need it fixed tomorrow '' 
 & gt '' yes sir '' i empathize i understand but the next business day since we 're after the cutoff for the weekend is actually tuesday '' 
 ugh ... lawyers & gt '' fine then i am going to need a loaner system '' 
 & gt '' i 'm sorry sir '' i apologized but loaner systems are not logistically feasible 
 we can not offer those and do not have those to offer 
 even if we had systems in your area they would be unlikely to have the right software <unk> and files for you 
 so we just do not offer that service '' 
 i really do n't think he 's stopped to consider how hard it would be to offer loaner systems 
 & gt '' let me make this more clear to you '' he was getting angry now i am a lawyer and i have a next business day warranty and i will get my system fixed tomorrow or i will get a loaner tomorrow '' 
 & gt '' once again sir i 'm sorry but you wo n't 
 there is no one here who can make that happen for you '' 
 & gt '' i am a lawyer i can not be without my system fix it tomorrow '' 
 & gt '' you are a lawyer correct sir '' 
 & gt '' yes '' 
 & gt '' did you read your service contract '' 
 ... pause ... & gt '' my system is n't getting fixed until tuesday is it '' 
 & gt '' correct sir '' 
 & gt '' but i ca n't be without my system for three days '' 
 & gt '' then you should have bought two of them sir

 ** $ bigbn : ** ok let me jump on and take a look at the display

 ** $ csr_user : ** <unk> ** $ bigbn : ** ... ... ... .. <unk> : *** end user missed the day in <unk> where they taught how to read time previous the afternoon started ticking away i wondered why <unk> always felt so much longer than their morning counterparts 
 probably because i look at the clock a lot more 
 it had been a fairly settled day so far 
 i’d managed to convince redcheer that tech’s don’t have any special programs 
 she didn’t believe me at first until i opened up cmd and typed help apparently having a lot of options in a black screen was techy enough 
 my peaceful existence of staring at the clock was shattered when scarfy decided to shout my name across the workplace 
 & gt scarfy : airz 
 i got up from my chair 
 the red haired lady stood up too 
 we walked over to scarfy as a tech duo 
 the red haired lady had a large smile on her face as she arrived at scarfy’s desk 
 & gt redcheer : what can <unk> do for you 
 scarfy had a <unk> look on his face 
 he wasn’t sure what to make of this suddenly nice redcheer 
 & gt scarfy : my… er… my… scarfy’s eyes looked like they were attempting to calculate what was going on 
 & gt scarfy : my computer isn’t connecting to the network properly its got <unk> but i can’t connect to other computers 
 & gt redcheer : don’t worry <unk> have that fixed in no time 
 redcheer opened up cmd 
 then typed in help 
 she started reading the options 
 & gt scarfy : i’m kinda <unk> 
 airz can you just… 
 & gt redcheer : no 
 i have to learn 
 i stood behind redcheer scarfy looked nervous 
 i decided redcheer reading the help command in cmd wasn’t the best use of time 
 & gt me : hey redcheer maybe you should look troubleshooting steps up on the internet 
 & gt redcheer : mmmm might be quicker 
 i’ll learn what this does later 
 redcheer then clicked open the browser 
 it had been <unk> at the bottom of the page 
 & gt <unk> <unk> & gt <unk> for <unk> redcheer stared at the screen for a few seconds 
 she finally found the words 
 & gt redcheer : wha… 
 & gt scarfy : look just… i <unk> the both looked at each other i wasn’t really sure what was going on 
 the silence was <unk> 
 & gt redcheer : airz <unk> you fix the rest of this 
 i got ta … go 
 redcheer stood up and just walked away she looked oddly shell shocked 
 scarfy looked at me as if waiting for something 
 i decided to take redcheer’s seat and start fixing the computer 
 & gt scarfy : arn’t you going to go make sure she’s okay 
 & gt me : what 
 i was confused 
 however my confusion about why scarfy’s computer wasn’t playing nice with the network was swiftly <unk> 
 a second window was open behind the job search 
 & gt <unk> to search <unk> & gt *ten ways to make sure no-one is <unk> on your internet* i looked down the list 
 it was filled with terrible ideas 
 & gt me : you didn’t actually follow this list did you 
 the first item was downloading a <unk> program 
 the entire website looked like where <unk> are born 
 & gt scarfy : well i didn’t exactly want to spread that i was searching for a new job did i 
 i looked at the processes tab 
 it had <unk> processes running 
 yep it was infected 
 & gt me : i think you’ve managed to get this pc infected 
 it’ll have to be scrubbed 
 & gt scarfy : before you start that go look for redcheer 
 & gt me : huh 
 she was here a second ago 
 scarfy stood up swung his leg backwards and forward lightly into my <unk> 
 & gt scarfy : go 
 … not wanting to get kicked again i walked away from the infected workstation 
 when i looked behind me scarfy had a smile that said “see told you kicks solve <unk> 
 his eyes however only held sadness 
 i never did get back to the infected computer 
 i did leave a note for the returning tech though 
 next i work for a mobile phone chain in australia just to give everyone reference 
 the average busy day mild tech support sales and the rest 
 in a <unk> i sit at one of the desks and before long a call comes in 
 me : yada yada store this is yada how can i help you '' 
 c : oh good i was just at & lt another branch & gt and the guy there was just down right rude and unhelpful '' 
 m : sorry to hear that i would love to help you 
 so what is it you need to do '' 
 c : so i have these golf clubs '' m : uhm '' 
 c : and my friend said they would sell real quick on <unk> '' m : okay '' 
 c : but the guy at the other shop would n't do it 
 m : im sorry sir do what 
 c : put them on ebay for me 
 m : well that involves your money and a degree of personal risk and as we are working for & lt company & gt we ca n't involve ourselves in that 
 c : but ebay is on my phone getting really loud and angry 
 you sold me this phone 
 m : sorry sir but that has nothing to do with & lt company & gt 
 it 's not worth my job doing that 
 c : but what about melbourne 
 m : sorry ... .. what about melbourne 
 c : i need to sell those clubs to get the money to go to melbourne next week 
 m : uhh ... ... i am really sorry but i ca n't help you with that sir 
 c : you & lt expletive & gt are all the same 
 i am going to go change to my phone to & lt competitor & gt 
 <unk> the phone* i just sat there <unk> here 's one i thought you all might get a kick out of 
 a new guy started in my office a week ago 
 he sits in the cube next to mine he 's a <unk> and has served in iraq and afghanistan 
 i think he 's a nice guy kind of laid back for someone who just got out of a war zone 
 he seems to know his stuff fitting in nicely 
 well today i 'm sitting in my cube it 's after <unk> pm which is considered after hours for most of our clients 
 this is important because in some cases if we have to escalate an issue it wont be attended to until the next business day especially for one of our clients that has a no exception policy for some crazy reason 
 with the holiday weekend that means something coming in tonight wont be addressed until at least wednesday 
 so i 'm sitting there wrapping up a ticket and i hear him catch a call 
 he reads the script for our crazy client no exceptions and starts troubleshooting with the caller 
 i hear him go through the steps and he decides he has to escalate the ticket 
 he tells the caller that given the holiday weekend he may not hear back for at least four days 
 just then i can hear the client screaming at him on his head set 
 i stand up and i look at him he 's sitting there cool as a <unk> fiddling with a <unk> cube while this caller screams at him 
 he casually tells the caller this please i 've been in iraq and <unk> 
 i 've had people trying to kill me every day for the past six years 
 raising your voice to me like that will not get your issue attended to any faster 
 i can put in an email to the head of the level 2 department but if he decides you have to wait until wednesday there 's nothing more i can do '' 
 the caller seemed to calm down and my co-worker just smiled that 's alright i 'll send that email now 
 have a nice day '' 
 i learned something very important today you do n't know how bad you 've got it unless you 've had your life on the line makes the stuff i 've had to put up with seem so trivial now 
 that and it 's possible to be a hardcore bad ass and still be polite and maintain your <unk> 
 hey tfts 
 i 'm a ltl ftp 
 i used to work for a walk in phone and tablet repair centre for # <unk> and have since moved on to another line of walk in tech support but this story is about back then 
 i frequently got strange customers and issues but this is one that 's always stuck with me 
 a customer walks in about half way through a standard day of work sits at my desk and tells me her problem 
 we 'll call her broken phone lady # bpl 
 bpl : i 've noticed that my phone has been getting really hot and slow recently 
 can you fix it '' 
 i tell her i 'll do what i can take her phone and scan her <unk> in to our systems to check the warranty is still valid 
 when the system brought up the details of her phone i noticed two issues 
 the back case of her phone is for the 3g model and has the logo of # <unk> yet the system says she should have the 4g model from # <unk> 
 i shrug it off and begin the physical inspection of the phone whilst asking her for more details about her use of the phone 
 after talking with her i notice nothing out of the ordinary with what she was telling me but notice something did n't look right about the back of her phone 
 the camera and flash seemed discoloured and the plastic was flat and missing details 
 on closer inspection i realised it had melted 
 uh oh 
 me : excuse me a minute i 'm just going to talk with a technician '' 
 i walk in to the back and bring the phone to my manager 
 my mind went straight to worst case scenario and thought the phone could have possibly overheated intensely and melted the back 
 after a quick inspection by both of us he tells me to go back out and ask if the customer was aware of the damage at all 
 me : we 've noticed there 's some melting on the back of your phone were you aware of this at all '' 
 bpl : oh 
 i forgot all about that 
 it should n't be a problem though '' 
 me : sorry 
 what happened '' 
 bpl : a while ago i forgot i left the stove on and put my phone down 
 when i came back to it the back cover had completely melted 
 but that should n't be a problem i bought a new back cover '' 
 i thank her for her <unk> and inform her that her phone is 100 % out of warranty 
 she took it <unk> well and left without causing a scene 
 so i originally submitted this story as a comment on the crack laptop story and more than 20 people thought i should submit it as a main story so here you go 
 a few years ago i worked as a repair technician at a popular <unk> computer store and the specific store i worked at was in a <unk> area <unk> for a high concentration of rich bitches and their rich dick husbands and rich <unk> children 
 you may have seen a movie starring <unk> <unk> that was based on the high school that serves this particular area ... one day a woman came in with a laptop 
 this woman was fully <unk> in that particular combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> clothing that is meant to tell the world i 'm richer than you so shut up and do my <unk> <unk> '' but actually it just screams i married my husband for his <unk> <unk> and now i 'm blowing both the money and the pool boy '' 
 i assume you 're familiar with this type of person – the type that thinks that listening or paying attention to directions is so clearly beneath her station in life that even asking her to do so is a waste of her time 
 before she even got to the counter i noticed the <unk> sticker on the lid of the laptop 
 it stuck out because it was totally <unk> with the rest of her belongings 
 so i was n't surprised when the first words out of her mouth were i bought this laptop for my son '' – most of these people would buy a laptop for each of their children by the time the kids were in middle school 
 and the next words out of her mouth were and he says it does n't turn on anymore '' 
 the laptop was a year or two old and appeared to be in pretty good shape – a little bit of <unk> no obvious damage – but any time we had a computer without power we were supposed to double-check for liquid damage before we quoted a repair 
 so i excused myself and took the computer to the back room and opened it up 
 sure enough there were some remaining <unk> spots and even a few drops of water left inside the machine 
 but that 's not what caught my attention 
 on that particular model the keyboard is built into the top panel of the housing so you have to remove the entire panel and keyboard to open the machine 
 as i pulled the panel off and turned it over onto the workbench some little <unk> flakes fell out of somewhere 
 i looked closer at them 
 they looked strangely ... familiar 
 i took a hard look at the keyboard ... especially the <unk> around the keys where dust and hair get in 
 more green flakes seemed to be trapped there 
 so i took a can of compressed air put the <unk> up to the back side of the keyboard 
 a ton of green flakes flew out all over the workbench 
 i was starting to get an idea of what might have happened to this computer 
 so i <unk> my finger in the drops of remaining liquid inside the computer raised it to my nose and sniffed ... which confirmed my theory 
 this kid had been smoking pot and i do n't know if he was rolling <unk> on this keyboard or what but over the past couple of years he had managed to get at least <unk> entire <unk> worth of ground <unk> trapped in his keyboard 
 and the spilled liquid that had fried his laptop in the end 
 <unk> water 
 * nasty funky <unk> bong water 
 i showed my discovery to the other technicians and we all had a good laugh 
 one of the newer techs asked me so what are you going to tell her '' 
 i thought about this for a moment 
 this lady was *not* the sort of person who would react well to having a retail <unk> tell her that her son was up to no good 
 the more i thought about it the more i thought ... hell if this lady were <unk> mother i 'd be using every form of <unk> <unk> available to me too '' 
 so my course was clear 
 i blew the rest of the bits out of the keyboard wiped up the weed that was all over the bench <unk> the thing and took it back out front 
 i 'm sorry ma'am but it does appear that a glass of water must have been spilled near the laptop 
 under these circumstances we do have to ship the laptop out to be fully <unk> and it will not be covered under warranty 
 the cost to get this laptop working again will be $ <unk> and we could have it ready in about a week '' 
 she did n't even <unk> she paid without <unk> 
 i never told her what i 'd found 
 wherever you are <unk> i hope you survived high school 
 **tl dr : rich bitch mom brings in son 's laptop full of weed and fried by spilt bong water 
 i do the kid a solid by wiping away the evidence 
 **while this is not official tech-support i figured you guys would like to hear a truly happy tale 
 it involves technology babies and cookies so it has to be worth it 
 at my <unk> we check and install child safety seats 
 enter new parents we 'll call dirk and <unk> and their adorable two day old daughter emma 
 now dirk is not letting one <unk> of this child 's first week go <unk> 
 i can only imagine what 's on the camera 
 dirk had done an excellent job of installing emma 's child seat 
 in fact it only needed a little bit of <unk> 
 while i went over the paperwork dirk asked if he could use the restroom 
 i showed him to the restroom and returned to the vehicle for mom and baby were playing happily 
 mom took it upon herself to get the camera to take some more pictures of baby emma 
 dirk returned from the restroom to see mom taking more pictures of baby <unk> sleeping 
 honey the camera would n't take any more pictures but i used that format thing to make more room '' said mom 
 all color left <unk> face 
 i honestly thought we were going to have to load him in the ambulance 
 he broke out into a cold sweat and did everything he could to contain his panic 
 that card had in fact contained all of the photos from birth until now for baby emma 
 i thought the man was going to cry 
 in fact upon seeing his reaction mom realized what she had done 
 before this lovely couple started yelling at each other i told her turn off the camera right now '' 
 i explained to him that the pictures could likely be retrieved even though the card had been formatted 
 his response was one of incredulity 
 he did not believe that was possible 
 i retrieved my laptop inserted their sd card and proceeded to recover all but a couple of the photos from the birth of baby emma until their visit to the fire station using some sd recovery software i 'd used before 
 in the end <unk> harmony was <unk> baby emma 's first days will survive in pictures and my whole crew was treated to a couple of boxes of thin mints and a half gallon of vanilla ice <unk> 
 tl dr <unk> ... .. thin mints cookies and vanilla ice <unk> 
 hello 
 my first post in this subreddit though i 've been lurking for awhile 
 i 'll start off my saying i work at an authorized <unk> for a cell phone company 
 basically we are our own company but only offer the services of a single <unk> cellphone provider 
 we have over 50 locations and i am the single it guy 
 i take care of <unk> computers logins and passwords for over 400 workers and make our <unk> for all our demo phones in the stores as well as several other tasks 
 so ... this takes place about a year ago 
 it falls within my realm as it support so i 'm hoping this fits well 
 there i am at a book signing its around <unk> so most of our stores have another hour to go before closing 
 my cell phone rings the id says it 's a manager of one of our stores about 250 miles away 
 i shall call him $ cowboy 
 $ me : this is armantes '' 
 $ cowboy : armantes ... we got our ipad stolen 
 are you near a computer '' 
 $ me : *looks around* i am nowhere in the vicinity of a computer 
 what do you mean your ipad got stolen 
 is there security camera footage '' 
 $ cowboy : i 'm looking for it now 
 i need you to track the ipad though 
 are you seriously not near a computer '' 
 i remember suddenly we have a store location at the particular <unk> i 'm at for the book signing 
 $ me : oh 
 yeah 
 gim me two minutes $ cowboy '' 
 i run to the store 
 new guy is behind the counter 
 hey $ newguy 
 i 'm your computer guy 
 i 'm going to <unk> one of your computers to track a stolen ipad 
 call $ <unk> if you have a problem with it she knows me '' 
 he gives me a confused look and decides he 'd rather not deal with me 
 i log on to icloud and the tablet is turned off 
 i relay this to $ cowboy 
 i set the alert ping lost practically every setting i can 
 i go back to my book signing in peace now knowing it 's probably not going to amount to much of anything 
 i get home around <unk> check my email and do n't see any updates so i go to bed 
 i lay toss turn and eventually get back up at <unk> and decide i 'll check the find my iphone portion of icloud 
 i do n't expect to see much since no new e-mails have come through 
 i log in 
 tablet is offline 
 i grab a drink of water 
 i sit back down 
 loading ... '' ipad pops online ... at <unk> 
 i get the email with an address 
 i log the address into google maps go to street view 
 well that looks ... interesting in a this is totally a drug house '' kind of way 
 i google the local police dispatch number and give them the case number i had gotten from $ cowboy and get forwarded to the officer on duty after a generous 45 minute hold 
 $ cop : what can i do for you '' 
 $ me : hi 
 this is in reference to case number <unk> 
 i 'd like to report an address that was pinged from our ipad '' 
 $ cop : absolutely 
 what is it '' 
 $ me : 1234 <unk> lane x city and y zip '' $ cop : oh ... really 
 i know that house 
 it 's not a good place 
 thanks for the info 
 what time will you be available tomorrow if we have any questions '' 
 $ me : i wake up at 7am but i generally do n't get to my office until 8am '' 
 we exchange numbers and i go to sleep giddy in the fact for once icloud came in somewhat useful 
 i shall interrupt the story now by saying throughout the night $ cowboy had been texting me and he was ready to go down to the house <unk> in hand and take back his store ipad 
 i informed him i already let the cops know but if he wanted to do a <unk> of his own i was n't going to stop him only that i said it would be an awful idea and i highly suggest he stays home and goes to bed 
 <unk> i take my first step literally into my office 
 my cellphone rings it 's $ cop 
 $ me : morning detective 
 what can i help you with '' 
 $ cop : hey armantes 
 just wanted to let you know i just produced the warrant to the occupants of the house 
 turns out that you giving me evidence of something being in this house was all it took for the judge to sign off 
 there are pause for effect ... a lot of <unk> here 
 i 'll call you later if we 're able to confirm your ipad is here '' 
 turns out this house had been used as a <unk> distribution point 
 there was a very large sum of cash large crates full of science equipment and scales drugs and several stolen electronics 
 unfortunately due to ongoing investigation of drug <unk> we still have n't gotten our ipad back 
 oh 
 $ cowboy did end up going to <unk> the house 
 an officer found him at 3am gave him a warning that the people in the house have been known to shoot at cops for just knocking on the door 
 $ cowboy left a few minutes after he heard that tale 
 previous another pda dropped dejectedly down on my desk 
 it’s screen cracked its owner non <unk> 
 & gt saleshead : can you get this back to me by this afternoon 
 i’ve got a very dull offsite meeting to <unk> & gt me : this is the third screen you 've cracked this week 
 saleshead looked down at my exasperation with a look of boredom 
 & gt saleshead : they’re really easy to break 
 sorry for using the device you gave us 
 geez 
 & gt me : three screens 
 in a week 
 i looked over to the rapidly dwindling spare screen pile 
 & gt saleshead : just give me the forms okay 
 & gt me : surely after two ... i looked down at my hand in awe holding up three fingers 
 saleshead started to look slightly annoyed at my <unk> 
 & gt saleshead : what do you care 
 your not even paying for the screens 
 & gt me : first it was in your pocket and broke then it was accidentally dropped and broke 
 what happened to this one 
 i slid the forms across the desk 
 & gt saleshead : seriously 
 why does it matter 
 my department pays for all the screens i break 
 stop going on 
 & gt me : it’s not the cost 
 it’s the time 
 every screen takes time to <unk> & gt saleshead : <unk> 
 time 
 how long does it even take 
 & gt me : at least 20 minutes 
 saleshead stood back up with a smile a look of triumph 
 she finished filling out the form an started to leave 
 & gt saleshead : complaining about only 20 minutes 
 <unk> 
 saleshead shook her head at me as she parted 
 & gt me : three though 
 <unk> saleshead turned around to see me wide eyed holding up three fingers 
 & gt me : in a <unk> 
 next previous ***** after seeing the <unk> site offices that looked like mini <unk> parked outside our main building walking in for my first day i was excited for the new year 
 perhaps it would finally get the space it deserves i thought looking around at our cramped department 
 getting to my office i relaxed in my chair 
 however not a moment later the phone rang picking it up i heard the gruff <unk> voice of a builder 
 & gt gbuild : is this it 
 & gt me : yeah you’ve reached the head of it 
 & gt gbuild : oh excellent i was wondering if you’d connect up our site office to the internet for us 
 i smiled at the thought of getting to see what was actually inside a site office 
 & gt me : sure thing i’ll be up in half an hour 
 i grabbed a long patch cable and cable ties while attempting to figure out the nearest network port 
 upon arriving at the site office i knocked on the door 
 silence greeted my <unk> 
 i attempted to open the site office the door swung open 
 no one was inside 
 the entire office was pitch black someone had covered all the windows with <unk> wood 
 my hand reached for the light switch 
 <unk> nothing 
 no lights 
 no power 
 brilliant 
 i sighed and tried to <unk> my way through the office with just the light from the door 
 it was impossible things were <unk> upon evaluation i decided it was too dangerous a task to climb over the desks and chairs in almost pitch blackness without a <unk> 
 i turned to retrieve one from my office 
 ***** walking into my office my phone started to ring 
 perfect timing i thought 
 & gt gbuild : yeah hello 
 its the head builder again 
 you said you’d be half an hour its been forty five minutes and you’re still not here 
 what’s happening 
 & gt me : oh i was just out at your office there is no power 
 no lights or anything 
 & gt gbuild : we’re still trying to figure out how to get power for now we need internet working… i started getting an odd feeling 
 & gt me : i’m getting a <unk> so i can pass the cable into your office through the… 
 side ports 
 without falling over 
 & gt gbuild : cool 
 can you get that done by lunch 
 i wondered how long i could stretch out putting a cable through a hole and a <unk> probably to next year if i really got my <unk> pace going 
 & gt me : yeah… grabbing my <unk> and wondering what builders were going to do with internet but no power or lights i make my way back up to their offices 
 getting to the builders site office i realise yet again that no one is around 
 odd 
 i pass the cable through a hole in one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and through a window of our main building and into a network port 
 the end of that cable i plug into the switch that is sitting on one of the desks 
 done 
 ***** i smile and sit down on the chair in my office 
 job well done i thought 
 immediately however the phone rings 
 & gt gbuild : yeah it’s me again 
 you’ve run a cable for the internet i see but it doesn’t work for our systems without power… & gt me : well it wouldn’t the switch its plugged into needs power to run 
 the internet however is connected 
 & gt gbuild : seems useless without power 
 i sighed into my phone this builder didn’t seem that smart 
 & gt me : yep 
 & gt gbuild : you’re in charge of getting all the it stuff working right 
 & gt me : yeah thats generally our department 
 & gt gbuild : okay well none of our it equipment will work without power so can you organize someone to come out and connect us up with power 
 so our it will work 
 i was close to just hanging up the <unk> & gt me : no 
 & gt gbuild : but.. i didn’t hear the end of that <unk> the phone was already on the hook 
 next previous as i walked away from my first <unk> of the day i looked over towards the break area 
 a steaming <unk> cup of coffee was sitting on the bench 
 did someone make it for me 
 & gt scarfy : airz <unk> can you come back and help me with the printer 
 i looked forlornly over at the printer area my mind screamed at me to say no '' to anything to do with printers 
 & gt airz : er… i’ll just grab a cup of coffee 
 then i’ll work out whats up with the printers 
 & gt scarfy : oh that coffee on the bench is free one of the other designers made it for me you can have it 
 a coffee still steaming is now mine 
 i was internally screaming “yes” 
 after i grabbed it i walked back over to scarfy’s workstation 
 & gt scarfy : okay airz 
 so when i print it gets this error 
 do you know anything about printers 
 i took a sip of my coffee 
 it was instant 
 i felt a distinct <unk> in my stomach 
 & gt me : oh huh 
 would it be rude to throw away this horrible excuse for coffee 
 scarfy got up from his desk walked over to the laser printer 
 i followed him to the print area 
 & gt scarfy : well even if you 're not a printer expert i’ll show you what i do normally hopefully you’ll have some other ideas 
 scarfy then lifted his foot off the ground swung it backwards then flung it forward with great force straight into the side of the printer 
 the kick bounced off the plastic and made the entire unit slightly <unk> 
 & gt me : woah 
 scarfy 
 what are you doing 
 & gt scarfy : sometimes a good kick and it’ll start working 
 i looked down at the printer before me 
 poor little guy he’s been abused like crazy 
 i kinda felt sorry for the printer just a bit 
 & gt scarfy : well i’m all out of ideas 
 so what would you do now 
 the printer beeped <unk> up at me <unk> <unk> the printer was probably shouting at me 
 & gt me : you know what scarfy 
 you should get to downloading those files you wanted and leave this printer with me 
 poor printer 
 scarfy decided that was good enough for him and walked away 
 i looked down at the struggling device 
 lets see whats wrong with you… 
 the screen flashed an error code when i tried a test print 
 printers were no fuss with easy to read errors 
 & gt <unk> code : xxxxxx** excelent i’ll have the poor thing up on his feet in no time i thought as i started walking over to the computer 
 <unk> : error code xxxxxx** & gt <unk> : general <unk> general fault 
 how specific 
 i started reading the various things that are usually associated with the error 
 & gt broken fuser broken rollers broken motor power fault main board fault clogged drum damaged drum feeder unit jam feeder unit general fault <unk> <unk> oh for <unk> literally the entire printer was listed under the <unk> <unk> heading 
 i realised i’d have to open up the poor guy and see what was happening inside 
 printer maintenance 
 not usually my forte 
 scarfy decided he’d come take another look at how the printer was going 
 & gt scarfy : so any luck so far 
 & gt me : er just <unk> down the things it could be… i cracked open the paper feeder and opened the unit doors 
 scarfy took a seat and decided he wanted to chat 
 & gt scarfy : i had a printer at home <unk> & gt me : oh … what happened to it 
 i looked inside i started spinning the drum 
 seemed to spin okay 
 & gt scarfy : well at the time i had a girlfriend and one time the printer broke 
 i moved it off the desk and gave it a kick and that didn’t work 
 & gt me : haha you know kicking these things probably isn’t great for the calibration 
 usually doesn’t help that much either 
 i looked at all the rollers they all seemed to spin fine 
 & gt scarfy : trust me 
 a swift kick sorts out more problems then you’d expect 
 anyway the broken printer wasn’t working and my girlfriend got really mad 
 she ended up throwing it into a drywall 
 massive dent in the wall 
 pretty spectacularly though the printer didn’t fall out of the wall 
 everything inside the printer seemed to be working reasonably well… i started putting things back into the printer 
 & gt scarfy : i plugged it in though… started working while lodged in the wall 
 & gt me : sorry you saw a printer lodged in a wall so you thought… 
 i’ll just go plug that in 
 & gt scarfy : i had a hunch 
 plus it printed what we needed 
 i put the trays back into the printer 
 closed everything up and pressed test page 
 & gt me : <unk> 
 fair enough 
 i was <unk> i looked down at the printer 
 i had done literally nothing except pull it apart and put it back together 
 the test page printed successfully 
 weird 
 & gt scarfy : i ended up leaving it in the wall 
 the printer worked at that exact spot for a few years after that 
 i clicked test page again 
 & gt me : so it stopped working eventually 
 & gt scarfy : well eventually it ran out of ink and when i replaced the ink and put the printer back in the hole in the wall it just didn’t wan na work anymore 
 the printer started letting off distressed tones 
 i didn’t know if it was a protest to the story of printer torture or an actual problem 
 i looked down at the screen 
 error code <unk> f*** 
 next <unk> how i thought i was removing my own access before getting fired 
 * years ago i used to do outsourced tech support 
 on one of the accounts i supported i <unk> accounts on mainframes and the applications that were on them 
 most of the time we get requests from hiring managers or supervisors to give or revoke access to either the mainframes or an individual application 
 once in a while we 'll receive a request to revoke access for a user from an auditor <unk> 
 employee no longer works but id is somehow still in the system etc 
 so i was happily <unk> along when i receive the following ticket : & gt please revoke access to application for the following user : prodigaltoast my id at the time i was more than a little worried 
 the particular company i worked at was in the process of <unk> and <unk> staff 
 the mood was quite gloomy during that period especially seeing our floor which once had <unk> tech support agents down to half that size 
 so was i *really* being asked to revoke my own access and was this in <unk> for firing me 
 i hesitantly brought it to the attention of my team lead 
 & gt **me** : ummm **team lead** can you take a look at this ticket 
 & gt **team lead** : sure 
 hmmm just looks like a standard revoke request 
 & gt **me** : take a look at the user 
 & gt **team lead** : uh 
 ... <unk> 
 ummm are you getting fired 
 & gt **me** : am i 
 & gt **team lead** : i do n't think so ... let 's have **team manager** look at this 
 & gt **team manager** : <unk> ... are you getting fired 
 & gt **me** : am i 
 & gt **team lead** : i did n't fire him ... & gt **team manager** : i 'm pretty sure only i can fire him i think ... & gt **me** : did you 
 & gt **team manager** : it would be a dick thing to do to make him revoke his own access before we escorted him out of the building 
 anyways what do think we should do about this prodigaltoast 
 & gt **me** : well technically i could just revoke my account and it would n't really change anything 
 because i have administrative rights to the mainframe the application <unk> on i can just go <unk> my account whenever i need specific access to that application 
 in the end this ticket is basically a 2 minute waste of my time 
 you know as long as i’m not being fired 
 thankfully the ending was anticlimactic 
 it was a pretty useless ticket and i assume it was because of some automatic audit thing but as an administrator i was <unk> from those audits so i never really figured it out 
 my notes for the ticket looked like this : & gt my id : revoked access to application for user my id & gt my id : <unk> access to application for user my id to confirm user my id had been revoked 
 sorry if this rips off the story about waiting for the web developer but i could n't resist posting it 
 someone came into the store 
 they asked me if i could go grab the the person in charge of building custom computers common mistake

 thanks guys 
 <unk> years ago i was running a 1 to 1 at a <unk> school in the us 
 1 to 1 deployments mean every high school kid gets a laptop 
 i was managing 6,000 macbooks and 40 servers as well as <unk> or so mac desktops at the time 
 one day my boss calls me and the conversation goes like this : boss : hey <unk> we have a serious issue and you need to address it right now me : ok boss what is this serious issue 
 boss : your co-worker <unk> printed out the master password list for the local admin accounts and left it on his desk and a student stole it 
 me : <unk> 
 so basically i need to reset 6 local admin passwords like right now 
 boss : yes drop whatever you 're doing and do it now 
 me : no problem boss i will have it fixed with in the hour 
 i hang up the phone whip up a script in <unk> to reset the local admin password but i make one fatal mistake in my <unk> 
 i forget to output everything to /dev/null so everything goes to standard output ie the system.log 
 my mistake under pressure plus i thought no way a high school kid knows unix 
 i find this out fix the script redirect all output to /dev/null and the password in the script stops getting logged 
 so the password is on clear text but only on several hundred machines 
 ok no problem i am going to send a command out to wipe the system.log file and clean up my mess 
 since to change the password i had to set a password in a script 
 this was back in like 2008 and let 's say now my scripting behavior is a bit different now 
 : - during this small window some kid had been sifting through the console looking at every single log file 
 somehow picked out a string he thought looked like a password and bam he had local admin access to the machines 
 so i start doing detective work and use a dummy receipt system 
 basically look for a file or string that exists and if it does touch another file to stamp it '' with a dummy receipt and then build a database of machines based on that file to see what accounts have been promoted to admin accounts 
 sure enough this one student 's user account was synchronized to a lot of macs and sure enough his account was always being promoted to admin 
 i gathered my evidence called the student into my office 
 socially awkward kid but actually quite brilliant 
 i asked him why he was violating the aup acceptable usage policy and that i had proof he was giving himself admin rights 
 he broke immediately 
 i did n't even have to threaten the kid 
 he spilled his beans i asked him if he pulled the password form the log he said yes 
 i asked him if he had ever used unix before he said no it was just figuring it out on the fly 
 i told him i was n't going to turn him in and that i will just forget the incident ever happened 
 he asked me why and i said you 're too smart to get expelled or suspended 
 however you need to take your brain and use it <unk> 
 what do you want to learn the most on the computer 
 he said he wanted to start a programming club and develop games in python 
 next week i rolled down to the storage facility and grabbed a compaq dual <unk> server with a raid 5 controller and 3 hard disks in it and like 4 or <unk> of ram 
 it was one of those spend your budget money or lose it deal government am i right 
 and they had been sitting there since i started working there so about 2 years had passed and those servers had been collecting dust 
 they had no os on it 
 i come into his building with the server on a flat bed 
 i said here is your development server 
 here are the rules 
 you can not plug this into our network my network manager will shut this box down immediately do you understand 
 yes he replied 
 second rule this server has no os on it so you must choose what os you want to put on it and you have to support it yourself 
 you can not call help desk for help and it has to be legit either open source or someone buy 's an actual license 
 i understand he said 
 2 years later the kid <unk> and gets a full ride to <unk> college 
 he also wrote the advanced math <unk> his senior year 
 he did a bunch of stuff in python and <unk> 
 oh i also turned him into my mole 
 every time some kid talked about hacking he would email me and tell me what they were trying to do 
 i have n't talked to him since but i bet by now he is graduated 
 pretty smart kid hope he <unk> 
 him getting expelled or suspended or even in trouble may have damaged his record which may have damaged his chances at a full <unk> 
 mind you i was working for an impoverished school district a lot of families in that district were below <unk> level 
 edit - fixed formatting sometimes it is good not being the iron fist <unk> over authoritative dick head system administrator but sometimes you got ta do that to get your point across 
 i was lucky enough to realize the situation and actually put this kid 's smarts to productive use 
 i hope he has a bad ass job right now 
 edit # 2 several of you have expressed interest in the fact it was an impoverished school district and they all got laptops 
 let me explain to you how <unk> works in public education 
 the state you live in sets a budget and according to your size and your location you get x amount of dollars every year 
 now additionally you can get <unk> money as well on top of state money 
 the budget is then broken down into categories 
 you have budget for staff which covers their wages benefits and so forth 
 capital <unk> is the part of the budget you spend on technology desks <unk> and so forth 
 it can not be used for salary the government does not allow you to do so 
 furthermore the government has a thing called <unk> which i believe is <unk> by the fcc 
 it forces companies who join such a program to lower their prices for schools and allows schools access to technologies through this program 
 the school i worked for which i no longer do work there decided they wanted to go 1 to 1. with macbooks being about $ <unk> a pop it was n't too much out of the question 
 you only have a little bit of <unk> with a desktop since you must also pay for keyboards mice and monitors and they require more power 
 a laptop is 1 plug 
 the school was about 60 buildings and 30,000 students 
 the laptop program was at the high school level only which was <unk> you have to realize a lot of these kids never even ate their first meal for that day until they came to school 
 i grew up lower middle class and i thought i had missed out on certain things in life and that i was a bit under privileged compared to all the other kids i went to school with 
 i did n't realize how selfish and self centered i was until i got this job 
 i worked there for 5 years running their laptop program 
 i got a bike for christmas and while my family was unable to ever take me on international <unk> or <unk> we at least got to go to the lake for vacation 
 these kids have nothing 
 it taught me how privileged i was 
 giving them a laptop is awesome 
 sure some kids will <unk> their opportunities and not care sure some will just get by and not take full advantage of it but some kids will put it to good use and get full <unk> to good colleges and come out on top 
 that right there makes it completely worth it 
 **edit # 3** it is possible the kid read this post 
 i am not going to say who my employer was or where it was because i believe anonymity is the best 
 i would hate to have anything backlash and reflect poorly on the school system i worked at 
 plus now i work back in the private sector and have learned it is really just a professional courtesy to keep your mouth shut 
 i will update if it was really him 
 <unk> the student in question has in fact found this thread and i have been messaging him via reddit 
 i have told him i wo n't reveal his name my name or the schools name for anonymity reasons 
 i think it is best kept that way 
 he also reminded me of a few other <unk> the students found and used which i forgot about 
 the ard agent bug apple 's fault which allowed you to run apple script with escalated privileges ie sudo 
 then we had a package that had a self <unk> auto update and i had to have one folder in that package <unk> bad developer and we managed application usage by file path 
 so once students figured out they could drop games in this folder they did 
 to <unk> this i switched off the write bit in <unk> and then just download and repacked the whole package manually every time an update came out and just <unk> said package 
 i 'll have to admit i was impressed by how <unk> and smart a few of the students were 
 they made me pay for my mistakes 
 plus it is impossible to test every aspect of security with out a security audit team 
 that is why companies have and contract out it security people to audit such things 
 i also changed my whole approach of imaging and managing the macs after a lot of these issues 
 the student in question is finishing up a computer engineering degree currently 
 glad he made it to a good <unk> all & lt php include <unk> & gt this is my first post here so let me know how it went 
 -- first ticket of the day i leaned back in my chair staring at the screen in front of me 
 the ticket was from a woman in accounts we 'll call her pa <unk> accountant for short 
 as usual the ticket was short and vague 
 & gt pa : keyboard does n't work 
 please fix 
 i took a sip of my tea 
 too hot 
 i sighed as i walked up the stairs to accounts wired keyboard under my arm 
 as i walked in i was met with pa pacing back and forth across the room almost jumping on me as i walked in 
 & gt pa : thank god you 're here 
 i 've got a report due in two hours and i need my computer working 
 & gt me : have you not got the report backed up somewhere 
 & gt pa : i do n't have time for that rubbish just fix it now 
 i sat down at the users pc staring at the login screen 
 i tried to press one of the keys but it did n't budge 
 confused i tried pressing another 
 after doing the highly technical <unk> test i confirmed that all of the keys were stuck 
 & gt me : have you had this keyboard long 
 & gt pa : no i only had it yesterday 
 you people in it messed up everything when you put in that new computer 
 what was wrong with my ... & gt me : have you spilt anything on this keyboard since yesterday 
 & gt pa : no 
 i never keep drinks near my keyboard 
 i glanced at the bottle of water next to her keyboard and she quickly grabbed it and stuffed it in a draw 
 i looked closer at her keyboard and saw a clear / off white substance under all of the keys 
 with great difficulty i pulled up on the keys and looked at what was beneath it 
 & gt me : what the <unk> $ k did you do to this keyboard 
 & gt pa : well i found the keys were too wobbly so i put some <unk> underneath them to stop them moving so much 
 i stared at her for about 10 minutes before plugging in the new keyboard picking up the old one and letting her manager know that she should n't be within <unk> of glue 
 or a keyboard 
 -- how did i do 
 it 's my first tale here so let me know if something is n't right 
 tl dr user does n't like the movement of keys on keyboard <unk> <unk> on them to stop the <unk> 
 edit : whoa i 'm blown away by the response 
 i was expecting this to drown and fall off the <unk> : d thanks everyone so i work for a small msp and we happen to support a local golf club 
 said golf club are always <unk> with their network and plugging stuff in to things and generally <unk> themselves to the outside world 
 those are stories for another day though 
 today i get a call from them 
 i 'll be **me : ** and they 'll be **sec : ** 
 & gt **me : ** good morning this is <unk> how can i help 
 & gt **sec : ** hi this is the secretary from <unk> 
 we have no internet 
 & gt **me : ** hi there <unk> let 's get this sorted 
 so after 10 minutes or so of turning things off and on 
 she says this 
 & gt **sec : ** could this be to do with the stewards they got internet put in to their building today 
 *isp* were up on our building too 
 & gt **me : ** okay lem me pop over and have a look 
 now this is starting to sound suspicious 
 thinking maybe the isp had dislodged something whilst putting the new line on for them i went over 
 <unk> 
 ** isp had come over <unk> this businesses <unk> and moved it over to a residential property 
 so we go over to the stewards house and they 're complaining that they 're getting a bunch of phone calls from people asking for the golf club 
 so *isp* has well and truly buggered up this business 
 they 've said it could take up to 3 weeks for them to come out and repair it 
 for a business that takes orders over the internet this could be quite <unk> for them ... welp 
 i guess i 'll get on with trying to get this 4g modem hooked up to their system ... rule one it rule two : everything is it 
 no exceptions 
 i’m not sure where this <unk> started but if you’re part of a competent it team suddenly everything will be your job 
 the job creep will start innocently with a phone call 
 & gt user : hey i’m not sure if this is strictly it but ... this conversation is usually <unk> by one of the following four people : 1. the user that inexplicably calls it for everything 
 you’ll be <unk> by inane questions things that have nothing to do with it at all 
 all attempts at pleading with the user to **not** call for the fourth time in an hour with non-it related questions fall on deaf ears 
 eventually your crumbling sanity may cause you to snap at said user 
 don’t 
 that would cause the filing of a hostile workplace suit 
 they’re expensive you can’t afford it 
 2. a user that can not explain precisely what the problem is he’ll use it language but in odd ways 
 example : yeah the thing is <unk> ever since the internet died yesterday 
 you’ll try to <unk> out what specific device he is referring to unfortunately his skills outside of describing its colour as white have disappeared 
 eventually you’ll give up and walk to his/her desk 
 3. occasionally a user of substance will call 
 they’ll tell you useful information that isn’t specially your job but that is useful to know 
 usually this information is about a fire in a server room or suspicious person <unk> stealing computers 
 the urge to shout at the user because they should have called either the fire <unk> or security may be high 
 don’t shout however at least they called <unk> 
 you’ll probably only lose <unk> the server <unk> 
 4. sometimes a problem tangentially related to it will call 
 people will ring it trying to order desks or stationary claiming since these products are essential to the function of their equipment they should have the ability to order it from one central location 
 attempts to forward the call onto the relevant department will be met with <unk> 
 if the following situations have left you <unk> with the fate of humanity don’t despair 
 the following ideas may disrupt the flow of these calls to your desk : 1. filter all it calls through an automated system 
 these systems annoy everyone therefore call volume overall will drop 
 less calls less non-it calls 
 — unfortunately your department would now be closer to a bad <unk> company then an actual helpful service 
 moral may <unk> 
 lock department windows 
 2. attempt to define it tasks through contract <unk> 
 — beware the phrase <unk> related <unk> 
 3. remove all phones from the department 
 establish email support only — if you thought people could be vague or obscure on the phone you’ve never read a long winded seven page email who’s purpose is spread evenly throughout the paragraphs 
 after 10 minutes of bad grammar you’ll be wanting the sweet release of calling even with its abuse 
 4. allow techs to hang up at any time in a call no questions asked — … if you’ve managed to land in a department that only deals with <unk> calls congratulations 
 your quota for good stuff happening is used up for life 
 <unk> - & gt user : hey i’m not sure if this is strictly it but we get a stapler attached to every printer 
 they keep going missing 
 & gt me : sorry no 
 we don’t deal with <unk> 
 expecting the user to apologise and hang up i was rather surprised when he continued 
 & gt user : no i mean physically attached 
 like with a chain 
 & gt me : try calling maintenance 
 they’ve got chain and <unk> 
 they’ll probably attach it to a desk near the printer 
 & gt user : no no i want it attached to the printer 
 so can you come do it now 
 if you don’t have a stapler don’t worry i think i can find one before you get here 
 & gt me : ... 
 no 
 we can’t do that 
 call maintenance 
 & gt user : cool 
 see you soon 
 the user hung up 
 he rung angrily the next day when for a second time his stapler went missing 
 apparently it’s loss is my fault 
 i now ca n't sleep because of the <unk> on the previous xmas party planning session previous <unk> i looked around from my coffee-less existence in the party planning meeting room 
 i decided coffee was next up on the agenda 
 i looked over to nice 
 her eyes deep <unk> of coffee 
 & gt me : coffee time i think 
 & gt nice : we need to choose the food though 
 i got up from my chair 
 coffee doesn’t wait for food choices 
 & gt me : we can discuss it while getting coffee 
 & gt nice : but then people will hear its meant to be a surprise 
 i looked down at the coffee-less desk 
 & gt me : surprise about the food at a christmas <unk> 
 kidding right 
 her eyes looked <unk> but glorious 
 & gt nice : oh of <unk> she smiled 
 my day was good 
 i picked up the grinder from the executive floor break room 
 it was an expensive model 
 & gt nice : so what are it foods 
 & gt me : it foods 
 i don’t think any exist 
 the coffee was being pushed through the machine 
 soon 
 & gt nice : well police have <unk> so it have… & gt me : errr… i looked down at my coffee 
 i took a sip 
 coffee was a food group right 
 & gt nice : toast 
 & gt me : sorry a toast 
 i held my cup up in the air ready to toast whatever nice wanted 
 & gt nice : no no silly 
 toast 
 its an it food <unk> 
 i looked down at coffee 
 then back up into nice’s eyes 
 <unk> 
 <unk> & gt nice : music also needs to be decided something it themed 
 & gt me : when you think it what music to you think 
 i took a sip 
 insights into the mind of the non - it world 
 & gt nice : techno 
 & gt me : er no we can’t have a christmas party with techno 
 & gt nice : but it has tech right in the name 
 & gt i looked wildly around the break room everywhere but nice’s eyes 
 & gt me : <unk> no 
 as in no tech listens to techno 
 the negative attitude of the <unk> hit home 
 nice’s eyes normally such nice dark coffee now looked <unk> a knock at the door interrupted my thoughts of apologies 
 vp’s secretary was standing at the door 
 & gt vpsec : i couldn’t help overhearing you have a music problem 
 nice shook off the oncoming tears and looked up at the vp’s secretary 
 a small scowl formed 
 & gt nice : no no 
 we’re fine 
 we got this everyone will be surprised at the party 
 vp’s secretary smiled and looked over at me 
 & gt vpsec : airz don’t you have a new suggestion box 
 might be worth people filling with music <unk> & gt me : i think that was for… 
 vp’s secretary gave me a look 
 & gt vpsec : all ideas are welcome in the idea box 
 right 
 & gt me : err… 
 & gt vpsec : don’t worry i’ve already got people to spread round the news to send all music ideas for the christmas party to the new anonymous suggestion box 
 i looked down at my coffee 
 i took a sip 
 & gt vpsec : oh and <unk> nice looked back into the eyes of vpsec 
 & gt vpsec : i know you like techno so put as many good tracks in the box as you like 
 & gt nice : but… the surprise 
 & gt vpsec : for a company christmas <unk> really 
 <unk> next i 'm at a consulting company doing information security stuff 
 one of our customers is a regional bank 
 they 've decided to take third party security seriously 
 for the <unk> any large entity likely <unk> third parties like vendors or business <unk> with valuable information or access so making sure those third parties are also secure enough is important 
 the way this usually works is as follows : our client sends the vendor a <unk> question questionnaire with yes/no answers and spaces for more elaborate answers 
 the client then selects 40 or 50 of these vendors for a site visit which usually takes <unk> hours 
 since the bank does n't have a lot of it or infosec staff to spare they hire our consulting firm 
 i 've been assigned a bunch of these <unk> fly out to city x sit down with the vendor 's compliance it hr and other staff ask them a bunch of questions walk through their operations and data center then fly home 
 generally i 'm not a typical auditor 
 i realize that nobody does this perfectly 
 what i 'm really afraid of is the <unk> the shop that claims to have everything locked up tight and they 're really doing nothing 
 that puts my client at the greatest risk 
 so i 'm in a city i never thought i 'd visit like <unk> city <unk> california or <unk> pa. office <unk> <unk> <unk> chain restaurants and rental cars 
 the consultant 's life 
 i 'm <unk> a company that handles fairly sensitive data for our client 
 every question in the questionnaire was answered 'yes without much explanation 
 that 's a red flag 
 i decide to probe a bit more 
 me : '' tell me about your dlp data loss prevention solution '' head of compliance : '' our it director can answer that question '' it director : '' we use a best of <unk> solution 
 it blocks all sensitive data from leaving our network '' me : '' i realize that dlp systems require a bit of <unk> to find the sensitive data that your shop deals with 
 how long did it take to implement '' 
 it director : '' just installed it and went 
 fire and forget '' 
 me : '' that sounds great 
 what kinds of data does it block '' 
 it director : '' all sensitive data '' me : '' so social security numbers '' 
 it director : '' of course '' me : '' what patterns are you looking for '' 
 it director : '' any that contain sensitive data '' me : '' maybe my accent is getting in the way of clarity 
 social security numbers are 9 digit numbers usually written in <unk> of 3 then 2 then 4. are you looking for all 9 digit numbers <unk> your network or just <unk> '' 
 it director looking annoyed : '' all sensitive traffic is <unk> then blocked 
 we get alerts '' 
 me : '' that 's amazing 
 on all your networks including the guest wireless '' 
 it director still annoyed and bored : '' of course '' me : '' ok. have you seen an alert for <unk> 
 that should have <unk> your network <unk> outgoing and incoming in the last few minutes '' 
 it director : '' what '' 
 me : '' i emailed myself <unk> <unk> 's social security number out of <unk> 
 from your network 
 maybe you should change the answer in the questionnaire on dlp to 'no 
 are there any other areas you 're not so sure on '' 
 needless to say the rest of the audit was a bit more fun 
 this happened yesterday : user called asking to borrow '' some zip ties 
 all i have is the 8 '' length which she also already had but she said she needed about 14 '' 
 & gt me : ok just put two of them together 
 & gt user : how do i do that 
 & gt me : ... put the pointy end of one into the square end of the other 
 & gt user : ok then how do i connect them 
 & gt me : ... she could never figure it out and had to get someone to help <unk> of the tales on this subreddit are stories of the frustration of clueless users <unk> bosses and basically anything that <unk> from working in an industry where nobody else really understands what you do 
 i thought i 'd share a different sort of story - the only time i really was n't sure what to do <unk> 
 i 'm still not completely sure i handled this properly but screw it i 'm not going to bother with a <unk> 
 i had several clients i supported <unk> to the point where i almost became another employee 
 these were engineering firms and while they did n't understand all the technology they understood the value of preventative maintenance taking care of equipment and the it itself was typically pretty <unk> 
 some of the employees would request my services for their personal computers which is how this story starts 
 i 'm at one of my best clients and their senior engineer a man in his 70 's approaches me 
 i 've known him for years and even met his family at a few company functions 
 he has a few daughters and a son - all in their 30 's and 40 's 
 here 's how the conversation went : * my son has recently passed away and i 'd like you to help recover some of his files '' 
 * sir i 'm very sorry for your loss 
 what can i do to help '' 
 * when going through my son 's estate the most recent copy of his will which was updated about 2 years ago has a significant portion of his assets going to his best friend and not to anyone in the family 
 we found some files on his laptop we ca n't open and thought they might have some <unk> as to why he made this decision - maybe a journal or something 
 we always thought we were close with him and are really perplexed as to why he 'd <unk> us 
 the friend seems just as surprised '' 
 * sure i 'll be glad to take a look at it although depending on the security there might not be anything i 'm able to do i 'm thinking <unk> etc 
 * no problem - whatever you can do '' so i get the laptop and go home 
 when i power it up i see in c : <unk> <unk> are the files in question 
 <unk> <unk> etc through about 7 or 8. someone had obviously been doing some digging - who the hell checks program files for rar files 
 anyway they vary in size from say 2gb to 5gb 
 try to open them up - and of course password protected 
 as rar 's are known for their <unk> security i figure i 'll have this job done in 5 minutes or less 
 i grab some random rar password <unk> and get the password 
 i open the files and - they 're all filled with - gay porn 
 most of it is pretty vanilla but there 's a little bit of light <unk> and <unk> 
 no <unk> personal files or anything else - just porn 
 as i work my way through archives 4 and 5 i realize that the file names are all now john and i doing x '' - not the names you 'd see from a porn site 
 great 
 so as i realize that i 'm looking at the <unk> porn of a dead man who was obviously in the closet to everyone - it dawns on me 
 the friend '' was really the boyfriend which is why he was named in the will and for whatever personal reasons the son / boyfriend do n't feel comfortable coming out to the guy 's father even in death 
 now 's probably a good time to mention that i 'm only 19 at the time and that i also happen to be <unk> i was completely in the closet at the time i still am to my family 
 so now instead of dealing with a simple file recovery i 'm faced with lying to an important client about his dead son or <unk> a dead son and boyfriend - with photographic evidence 
 fuck 
 i decided i 'd pull the laptop 's drive and search for deleted files in the off chance the son had a note or journal or letter to his dad that might somehow help the situation 
 i found nothing helpful - it seemed that his computer was solely for web browsing / online banking / porn 
 nothing helpful at all 
 fuck 
 i thought about it for a while and decided that the boyfriend was fully capable of disclosing this information if he chose to and that the son obviously wanted this information secure and that it was n't my place to <unk> it 
 however this still left me in a tricky situation with the father 
 i could n't tell him sorry i was n't able to open the files '' because he 'd simply find someone else who could and might not be as discreet as me 
 somewhere down the line the boyfriend and son would still be out and the father would know the <unk> porn existed 
 no i had to lie about it in such a way that the father would be satisfied and not pursue the issue 
 i pick up the phone : * hello it 's <unk> i 've got some news '' * really 
 did you find anything 
 a journal notes anything at all '' 
 * no i was able to decrypt the files and i could see why your son wanted to keep them secure 
 it turns out that he had downloaded some bootleg software and movies off the internet 
 it 's not a big deal but they can contain viruses and be dangerous to the computer so you 'd want to keep them protected 
 i 'd suggest deleting them or at least not trying to open them '' 
 * ah that makes sense 
 my son was always really good with computers and i could see him messing around with stuff like that 
 thank you for letting me know - the last thing i 'd want to do is try and open them and mess up his computer 
 you did n't find anything at all <unk> '' 
 * no sorry i even ran a <unk> search for deleted files just in case there was something in another location 
 i did n't really find any personal files at all '' 
 * wow that 's thorough 
 thank you for doing that 
 how much do i owe you '' 
 * oh considering the circumstances nothing at all ... i 'm sorry you did n't find what you were looking for and for your loss '' 
 **tl dr i lied to an old man to keep him from finding his dead gay closeted son 's amateur porn collection and kept the son 's boyfriend in the closet in the process 
 ** hello 
 first time poster so play nice just received this phonecall at the pc repair shop i work at 
 it went a little something like this : me : hello <unk> of our <unk> 
 how can i help 
 customer : oh hello 
 erm i 've just turned on my laptop and i do n't know how to connect it to the <unk> 
 i get this call quite often the gentleman sounded elderly so i gave him a little sympathy 
 me : okay are you wanting to connect wired or wirelessly 
 customer : well i tried using the yellow cable but i ca n't find anywhere to plug it in 
 this is where my suspicion started but i thought he might just be getting a bit confused 
 me : right well let 's just try wireless what operating system are you running 
 customer : microsoft me : okay so windows 
 do you know what version 
 pause customer : well when i press the button down the bottom left it says windows95 
 <unk> of face slamming against desk* further conversation discovered customer was using a 17 year old laptop with no ethernet port only modem for dial-up and no wireless capabilities to try to connect to his <unk> previous sitting down at my desk i contemplated the <unk> call 
 two techs destroying equipment is 100 % a <unk> <unk> however both were not on my payroll 
 this felt like a call for the bigp but the vp is probably searching for a way to get rid of both because his budget would look better 
 calling bigp was mercy 
 calling vp was death 
 i was the judge 
 my hand hovered over the dial 
 redcheer knocked on my office door 
 & gt redcheer : sorry again 
 about the whole hard drive thing 
 & gt me : i’ve heard your apologies 
 however i can’t reprimand you properly because you’re not on my payroll 
 redcheer took a deep sigh 
 she looked slightly upset 
 & gt redcheer : screw up **that** bad huh 
 i <unk> know 
 apologies again 
 & gt me : well it’s not me you’ll have to apologise too 
 i got ta call the bigp 
 redcheer 's face looked disappointed in herself 
 & gt redcheer : that’s probably for the best 
 perhaps i don’t know enough about it to be helpful 
 i looked over at the sad redcheer it seemed odd for her not to be smiling 
 itsec walked up behind redcheer and stood at the door 
 & gt itsec : er… i’m really sorry too boss 
 i didn’t realise that wasn’t a ruined hard drive 
 i thought it was wrecked 
 i should have checked 
 & gt me : wait but if you thought it was ruined why replace it in the stack with a new one from your own collection 
 & gt redcheer : that… part was me 
 to be honest itsec didn’t have anything to do with it 
 can’t we keep him out of it 
 i gave them a questioning expression as i looked between the <unk> redcheer and the downhearted itsec 
 quite the <unk> pair 
 & gt redcheer : itsec showed me his hard drive drawer and told me if i ever wrecked a hdd to replace it with one from his desk 
 he was just trying to help 
 & gt me : i see 
 & gt redcheer : so please airz 
 ring bigp but leave itsec out of it 
 it’s not fair on him 
 my mind <unk> between bigp and vp 
 mercy or death 
 next we have a 'special user you know the type 
 everything has to be 100 % functioning in the manner that they are comfortable with or else it 's broke 
 if it takes more than a day they cc everyone including your mom talking about how unhelpful you have been and requesting more assistance for their major problem '' 
 which it never is 
 well they were having a major '' issue where a secure website was making her click two options in ie in order to load and this was <unk> to her 
 i create a chrome shortcut that loads the website normally because this is how others go to that site 
 all fixed right 
 i immediately get a message from her about how it is still doing the same thing 
 i go to their desk and realize they totally ignored my message about the chrome icon and are still trying to use ie 
 i show them where the shortcut is which was difficult because they have <unk> shortcuts on their desk but this is not acceptable because they do n't trust google '' 
 i do n't like arguing i just want to fix shit so i go back to my desk only change the desktop icon to ie and wait 
 sure enough i get an email thanking me for fixing their problem 
 a few days ago $ boss contacted me about her sudden inability to export reports to pdf 
 i <unk> into her office as i am wont to do and asked what was up 
 & gt ** $ boss : ** it goes through all the steps of <unk> but when i export to the usual network path nothing is there 
 i 've tried restarting the program and the computer but it still does n't work 
 & gt **me : ** all right let 's try <unk> locally 
 maybe there 's something wrong with the network 
 the export dialog popped up on the screen for a moment and appeared to do its thing but nope still no report 
 & gt **me : ** i do n't have this problem so let 's log in as me and see whether that fixes it 
 alas it did not 
 at least we 'd confirmed it was isolated to one computer 
 & gt **boss : ** do we need to ... reinstall 
 <unk> <unk> in the background* & gt **me : ** it 's likely something got corrupted so it 's probably the easiest solution 
 just let me know when you do n't need your computer for half an hour or so 
 an hour or two later i was sitting in her <unk> chair happily reinstalling $ software along with adobe reader just in case 
 15 minutes later i was banging my head on the desk nothing had changed 
 then i realized something ... the dialog popped up *for a <unk> 
 the software in question is a buggy as hell mess so it 's usually the first thing i blame for a problem 
 it 's become a dangerous habit to assume any problems with that software must be caused <unk> that software 
 but what if ... 
 & gt **me : ** hey $ boss does n't the export usually take a few seconds 
 & gt **boss : ** you 're right 
 now it disappears almost instantly 
 & gt **me : ** okay we 've isolated the problem : your export is messed up 
 i 'll see what i can find 
 after digging around for what seemed like an eternity i found the problem : windows update <unk> 
 a <unk> little thing that supports <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> currency <unk> in windows '' 
 apparently that little <unk> update causes crystal reports to have a stroke on pretty much every version of windows & lt 10 
 $ boss is running 7 ... i uninstalled the update rebooted the computer and <unk> all good 
 aside from the pile of my hair scattered across the floor anyway 
 $ boss promised me a nice bottle of something for christmas as thanks 
 yay 
 tl dr : if crystal reports suddenly ca n't export to pdf run <unk> <unk> <unk> '' from an <unk> command prompt and reboot 
 edit : corrected some typos and inserted others 
 previous nice and defiant watched carefully as i outlined the procedure for getting new mobiles and pda’s connected up to the companies wifi 
 i was rather nervous about getting them to help out however i needed the extra hands 
 & gt me : okay everyone ready 
 any problems come and get me 
 & gt defiant : problems 
 <unk> be a cake walk 
 as i opened up the doors to let the people waiting flood into the meeting room i saw the slight <unk> of fear cross defiant’s face 
 he finally realised he had to deal with real users 
 after spending an <unk> amount of time attempting to connect a users phone without being able to touch it 
 i was getting particularly frustrated 
 & gt me : just give it here 
 i’ll get it connected in one minute 
 & gt frustrating : it’s a new phone i really don’t want anyone else touching it 
 sorry 
 i started to daydream about <unk> the phone and throwing it against a wall 
 i realised i should kick frustrating out before he <unk> his phones <unk> anymore 
 & gt me : okay unfortunately without being able to physically touch the device i can not connect it to our network 
 & gt frustrating : just give me the instructions 
 i sighed 
 we’d already had three attempts 
 is that not enough 
 & gt me : okay first go to settings no… not ... the one with wifi the… 
 ugh just … <unk> i wasn’t being clear 
 i knew that 
 i couldn’t help it my patience for frustrating had gone 
 i looked to my counterparts 
 nice was slowly setting up phones defiant however looked like he was struggling 
 & gt defiant : it seems your device doesn’t actually have wifi 
 this is *just* phone 
 it’s got a black and white screen so it can’t do internet 
 & gt no-en : yes 
 i want wifi 
 & gt defiant : no… this phone its to old for wifi 
 & gt no-en : please yes 
 install the wifi 
 just as my mouth opened to <unk> frustrating had a <unk> 
 i was forced to turn back to frustrating 
 & gt frustrating : i made it 
 i’m at wifi settings 
 & gt me : okay when it scans can you see the company wifi network 
 & gt frustrating : scans 
 & gt me : turn the wifi on 
 then show me the screen 
 frustrating started mumbling about this process taking such a long time 
 & gt frustrating : <unk> 
 i lost it 
 & gt me : just show me the screen 
 frustrating eyed me up nervously 
 he still didn’t angle the screen towards me 
 & gt frustrating : this <unk> a new phone 
 top of the line it sure cost me a pretty penny 
 i’m just not sure i’m ready to share that experience with… 
 well… phone-less <unk> 
 yet 
 & gt me : phone-less <unk> i was stunned 
 frustrating still refused to show me the screen 
 i decided to just tell him to leave 
 he refused 
 & gt frustrating : i think you’re just not the right tech 
 i’ll try that one… frustrating pointed to defiant who was slowly realising the reason he couldn’t get through to <unk> was a language barrier 
 he tried speaking slowly and clearly 
 it didn’t help 
 never does 
 & gt defiant : i - am - sorry 
 we - can - not - help - you 
 & gt no-en : phone wi-fi 
 no-en was still attempting to hand the phone to defiant 
 defiant tried hand signals he pointed at no-en phone and made a cross symbol with his hands 
 no-en just looked more and more confused 
 frustrating turned and spoke to no-en 
 & gt frustrating : @ # # $ @ & amp # @ # & amp <unk> wifi** @ # # $ ^ @ ^ # @ 
 & gt no-en : <unk> 
 no-en looked very sad 
 he started slowly walking away almost <unk> 
 i stood shocked the frustrating had <unk> a situation 
 frustrating looked down at defiant gleefully 
 defiant sat nervous about another non english speaker after hearing him speak whichever language no-en spoke 
 & gt frustrating : can you help me set up my wifi 
 realising frustrating spoke english defiant broke out a massive smile 
 defiant reached out to receive the phone from frustrating almost <unk> at the opportunity to help 
 & gt frustrating : yeah… i’d rather you didn’t 
 you know… touch it 
 as i beckoned to the next person in line to the desk i heard a <unk> and turned to see defiant’s head had hit the desk 
 & gt defiant : god help me 
 next previous friday 
 my final day at the design company 
 i was going to miss this place 
 as i arrived i looked around for something to do 
 i realized i still had n't re-imaged the harddrive of redcheer 's pc yet 
 the red haired lady found me looking down at her computer 
 & gt redcheer : time to get it up and running 
 & gt me : that 's the plan 
 want to help 
 redcheer smirked and held up another hard drive 
 she handed it off to me 
 i looked at the label 
 the size was much better 
 & gt me : you know i think i 'll miss this place a little 
 & gt redcheer : haha you 're not out the door yet 
 its only the start of friday 
 as we slowly <unk> the machine i saw how much redcheer had learnt this week 
 she was basically doing the entire install herself 
 & gt me : you 've got a <unk> for this ... & gt redcheer : haha ive done it before 
 she gave me a <unk> and settled into installing the programs 
 <unk> we got around to the design tools 
 & gt <unk> error - cd key invalid** & gt redcheer : woah what ... this key worked yesterday 
 annoyance <unk> up inside 
 we 'd forgot to deactivate the old keys 
 & gt me : we may need to put the old harddrive back in 
 & gt redcheer : no no ... i like this new one 
 it 's got space 
 & gt me : haha do n't worry 
 it 's going back afterwards 
 as i pulled apart the computer i wondered why the corporate key had run out of licenses ... i explained to redcheer what had to happen to get the computer to work we needed to deactivate the keys 
 then reactivate them on the new harddrive 
 after <unk> the licenses on the old harddrive we moved to them over to the new <unk> and continued installing 
 & gt <unk> error - cd key invalid** & gt redcheer : whaaaa 
 & gt me : might need some time to reset the key 
 & gt redcheer : <unk> i give up 
 its not like i 'll really need these tools anyway 
 i looked over at the authentication error 
 it was pretty annoying 
 i felt like giving up too 
 & gt me : okay we 'll we have to wait till the authentication server is updated ... so ... coffee 
 & gt redcheer : yeah 
 after coffee we can install some tech stuff 
 & gt me : sorry ... 
 redcheer gave me a smile it was almost patronizing 
 & gt redcheer : so i can increase my skills in tech 
 & gt me : what ... programs 
 & gt redcheer : all the tech ones 
 it was at that point that i realized as far as she 'd come ... she was n't quite it yet 
 next so 
 i get out of class today and pull out my phone and find i have 14 new messages from one of my neighbors 
 i listen to the voicemails my phone is set to not allow more than 10 voicemails from a person due to size and its one of my neighbors wanting tech support on his car 
 i 'm good at the software side of computers i 'm okay at the hardware side and i 'm good at cars that are n't over complicated 
 eg cars made before 2000 
 i call him and we start talking 
 & gt me : what 's up 
 & gt him : well my car wo n't start and i was hoping you could look at the computer and see if it has any error codes you can read 
 now cars use a not quite proprietary port that only cars use for getting into the car 's computer on top of that you often times need a book to find what the error codes mean 
 i used to have a cable but i lent it to one of my cousins about a month ago and have n't seen it since 
 which is fine by me 
 & gt me : i ca n't do that 
 & gt him : why not 
 you 're good at computers you 're good at cars why ca n't you fix the computer in my car 
 & gt me : i do n't have the cables to do that 
 & gt him : oh come on ca n't you just look at it 
 & gt me : you 're paying me for this either way 
 normally if i ca n't fix it or at least point them to someone who can i wo n't accept money food yes money no 
 & gt him : okay 
 just get over here 
 so i drive over and pull up to his garage and i see his early <unk> <unk> not sure of the exact year but i can tell the era 
 he 's under the hood looking at things 
 i walk up behind him 
 & gt me : any luck 
 he <unk> up real fast and smack his head on the hood 
 he <unk> in pain while i try to keep from laughing 
 & gt him rubbing his head : no 
 i think it may be something wrong in the programming 
 so i go through my normal troubleshooting for cars 
 takes about 20 minutes 
 i then realize it 's one of two things one the computer is dead or two the wiring is cut somewhere 
 i tell him and he starts grumbling about the only mechanic he <unk> retired 
 in my area there 's a guy who does <unk> a guy who does <unk> and there were 4 guys who were full service 
 the first sucks at his job the second just retired the third does n't take new customers right now and the fourth has a 2 week wait list unless you want to pay obscene amounts of money 
 & gt me : okay wait what was he doing when it stopped being able to start 
 hindsight being <unk> i should have asked him that to begin with 
 & gt him : i was cleaning the engine <unk> 
 & gt me : you take anything apart 
 & gt him : yeh almost everything 
 i walk over grab the manual and open the fuse box 
 sure enough the fuse that goes in there for handling starting the car was missing i go over to my car pull a spare fuse out of the glove box my car blows <unk> occasionally often times leaving me without headlights and grab one of the appropriate type 
 i plug it in and tell him to start it 
 it fires right up 
 he gives me a $ 20 and i tell him i 'm just really glad it was n't the computer 
 he agrees and we discuss the fact that though computers in cars are a thing you have to have special equipment to do it 
 he said okay and i left 
 tl dr : always check the power supply 
 *previous tales from dishonest used car dealership* /user/36055512/submitted/ & gt “you gon na be out at your <unk> this weekend ” & gt “yeah we’re having a huge party 
 you should stop by it’s going to be <unk> the raver and i were in the break room at dishonest used car dealership eating lunch one <unk> hot friday 
 his girlfriend lived on an island west of the city far enough from civilization that they regularly had parties enormous enough to be sort of <unk> <unk> among the weird <unk> kids who hung out at the sketchy dive bars up on the hill with all the gay bars and strip clubs like i did 
 after a couple incidents with people being <unk> at their events including a young lady who pulled a knife and started waving it in peoples faces they had <unk> a <unk> and <unk> only policy to limit the number of <unk> showing up 
 of course this had managed only to increase the <unk> of these giant events among the freaks in the city and in all likelihood there were even more sketchy people than ever <unk> the island on these occasional friday nights in the summer 
 as for me i’m pretty <unk> an <unk> - parties are not really my thing - but having made it out to one or two i did have to admit they knew how to have a good time 
 & gt tr : “how about you you seeing that photographer girl this weekend ” the photographer girl was a young lady i had gone on a couple dates with 
 as you might guess from the name she was a professional photographer and quite a good one at that 
 better yet she was a <unk> who liked whiskey a bit too much and had a hot temper which is a pretty <unk> combination 
 & gt me : “yeah i got <unk> into going with her her friend and her friend’s boyfriend to some movie <unk> & gt tr : <unk> dates 
 yuck 
 unless it’s going to turn into like something <unk> count me out.” the image of a sweaty <unk> <unk> the raver in my head i decided i wasn’t particularly hungry anymore and excused myself from the table 
 & gt me : “well i probably need to go back and clean up whatever horrible attempts at english colossal redneck has <unk> onto <unk> <unk> & gt tr : <unk> me know if you’re coming 
 last ferry is at midnight 
 just remember this is a friends and family thing you know ” & gt me : <unk> it.” *** & gt “uh your temperature <unk> & gt “yeah it does that.” i was sitting in the back seat of an old forest green grand cherokee eyeing the gauge cluster nervously 
 as we drove across the bridge from my weird neighborhood on east side of the lake to the core of the city where our <unk> movie was playing the <unk> temperature gauge on the jeep kept catching my eye 
 & gt me : “that’s not normal 
 you might keep an eye on that these <unk> don’t like to be overheated 
 i tell you what if you like i can have one of my techs look at it and i’ll throw you the friends and family <unk> this was surely going to win some bonus points with my date offering a discount to her friend’s boyfriend 
 & gt the boyfriend : “yeah well it’s fine 
 it’s just <unk> it’s hot outside 
 i’ll just add some water if i have <unk> & gt me : “yeah but even with it <unk> out it shouldn’t be getting that warm 
 i’ll bet you have a coolant leak somewhere 
 it’s probably an easy fix - there’s a valve for the heater that <unk> on these that will slowly leak coolant and it’s an easy job 
 i had to do it on my own cherokee not that long <unk> & gt the boyfriend : “i know cars 
 it’s <unk> & gt me : <unk> 
 not to <unk> the point but these <unk> like to blow head <unk> if they get too hot 
 i just don’t want to see an easy fix turn into a big repair you know ” & gt the boyfriend : “i’ve dealt with <unk> before 
 all you’re going to do is charge me to fix a bunch of things that aren’t broken and rip me <unk> okay then 
 my date gave me a look and rolled her eyes 
 she leaned over and whispered in my ear 
 & gt photographer girl : “he’s a dipsh t just let it <unk> i nodded 
 photographer girl had a theory that conversation between guys is less about exchanging information and more about <unk> a domain of knowledge and skill where you can be the <unk> party in the room 
 the older i’ve gotten the more i think she might have been right 
 by the time we got to the movie theater on the other side of town the temp gauge was <unk> at the maximum of its travel 
 as i <unk> out the miserable stench of an overheated car <unk> over my nose 
 it’s a combination of a <unk> gross smell from all the hot oil and a <unk> sweet <unk> <unk> smell from hot <unk> glycol 
 usually there’s some melted rubber smell in there too 
 it’s the smell of death 
 we watched the movie and the movie was bad and i hate movie <unk> and jesus christ popcorn is expensive but it was two hours of not having to talk to mr. bad attitude so maybe in the long run it was worth it 
 afterwards we all <unk> and decided we wanted to spend the night out on the island at the <unk> party so i got in touch with him to confirm our appearance 
 we drove toward the ferry terminal but on the way someone in a <unk> was apparently too busy chatting on the phone and managed to tag a semi bringing the whole <unk> to a screeching halt 
 we sat in the jeep air conditioning barely able to keep out the <unk> heat 
 by the time we got moving again the temperature gauge was back at the top of its travel 
 we managed to screech onto the 10:00 ferry 
 the boyfriend pulled onto the boat and we piled out 
 by now the death stench was different - hot <unk> but no sweet glycol smell 
 in all likelihood the boyfriend had run his jeep completely out of coolant 
 i thought about saying something but i suspected that my commentary would receive a similar response to earlier so i kept my trap shut 
 30 minutes later and the ferry pulled up to the dock on the other side of the water 
 the boyfriend put the key into the <unk> of the jeep turned it and the poor jeep hesitantly started up 
 it was making a <unk> noise 
 to my <unk> ear it was clearly running on five <unk> and the new <unk> <unk> through the vehicle suggested the same 
 this was an unhappy engine 
 the only solace was that i was sure soon its suffering would be over 
 we <unk> off the ferry making it about five miles outside of town on some <unk> side road before we encountered a <unk> hill and the poor old <unk> decided it just had had enough 
 it <unk> out and we stalled and rolled back down to the bottom 
 the boyfriend tried repeatedly to get the engine to start again but to no avail 
 i went around to the front of the jeep and he popped the hood 
 i was immediately struck with a wave of heat rolling out of the engine bay 
 at the back of the engine bay i spied a small black valve with a conspicuous crack <unk> green fluid 
 as i suspected the heater control valve had indeed cracked slowly <unk> all the engine’s coolant onto the ground 
 i grabbed a rag and popped open the radiator cap to be greeted by only smoke and steam note don’t do this unless you’re one million percent sure there’s no coolant or water in there 
 you will burn yourself and die 
 this engine was in the words of my colleague colossal redneck <unk> <unk> the boyfriend tried filling the radiator from a gallon jug he had in the back but the sad old <unk> was having none of it 
 i contemplated making the hike all the way back to the ferry terminal but it was already <unk> the last ship of the night back to the <unk> left port at <unk> and there was no way we were going to cover five miles of <unk> territory with two ladies in <unk> in 45 minutes 
 it looked like we were stranded until morning 
 immediately the <unk> started 
 & gt the boyfriend : “i thought you were some kind of <unk> guy <unk> how come all of the sudden you can’t get a f*cking car running ” before i had a chance to <unk> photographer girl jumped to my defense 
 & gt pg : “look dipsh t he told you this was going to be a problem four hours ago and lo and behold the heater thing has failed just like he said it would 
 and when he spoke up about your sh <unk> car overheating you opened your <unk> # ck mouth and told him to shut up 
 so *you* killed your car you idiot child and now we’re stuck out in the middle of f # cking nowhere on some sh <unk> island 
 good work <unk> ” i made a mental note not to ever try and argue with photographer girl because it was clear she would <unk> me 
 while the three of my companions were arguing i <unk> to the side pulled out my giant old brick of a smartphone and surreptitiously sent a text 
 & gt me : “hey dude 
 you know that <unk> hill about five miles out of town on the way to your girl’s place 
 we’re broken down at the bottom of it 
 can you come rescue us ” & gt the raver : “yeah man i know right where that’s at 
 let me get things square here and i’ll be on my way 
 i’ll text when i’m <unk> it was now time to do the <unk> <unk> <unk> thing : sitting on my ass trying not to grin while everyone else stuck on the side of the road bitched at each other 
 maybe some attractive <unk> would ask me how i beat the <unk> <unk> test a.k.a 
 how in the hell did i ever manage in one sitting to eat two entire <unk> of the colossal <unk> at the <unk> <unk> bar behind the ford dealership 
 “i changed the conditions of the test ” i’d say 
 “i ate one plate and when no one was looking i got so blasted drunk that i threw up in the <unk> outside and then i ate another one.” captain material right here 
 the following half hour can best be described as a <unk> of anger and shouting as my three <unk> tried to yell themselves into some kind of solution to our situation 
 photographer girl suggested we call a tow truck but the boyfriend didn’t want to pay the many hundreds of dollars it would cost to bring his dead jeep back to the city 
 my <unk> friend wanted to call a taxi of which there were precisely zero on the island 
 the boyfriend <unk> between making everyone walk back to town without him to summon help and just making camp for the night on the side of the road 
 in either case he <unk> refused to <unk> from his jeep 
 after a few rounds of heated debate the three realized that i hadn’t said much and that i was just leaning against the dead jeep playing with my phone 
 the boyfriend sauntered over and got in my face 
 & gt the boyfriend : “what the f*ck are you grinning at asshole ” & gt photographer girl : <unk> he’s looking at your stupid f*cking <unk> & gt me : “it is pretty f*cking <unk> i couldn’t resist 
 but before i had a chance to let everyone in on the plot and spoil the surprise my phone lit up with a text 
 the raver was just around the corner 
 & gt the boyfriend : “what the f*ck 
 is this asshole for real 
 you’re just sitting here texting while we’re all trying to figure out what to do ” & gt me : “yeah pretty <unk> what else was i going to say 
 rage lit in the boyfriend’s eyes and he pulled a fist back but before his <unk> assault could completely miss his girlfriend grabbed his arm and restrained him 
 in a split second he shook her off and wound up another punch but this time he was distracted by the <unk> of an ancient diesel volkswagen coming up from behind 
 it was the raver 
 i walked over to the approaching car 
 & gt the raver : <unk> <unk> & gt me : “hey sh <unk> 
 thanks again man i owe you big <unk> the boyfriend’s face was incredulous and he gestured toward the raver as his voice raised to an entirely new <unk> 
 & gt the boyfriend : “now who the f*ck is this f @ <unk> ” at this point the boyfriend had burnt every last bit of sympathy from any of us 
 even his own girlfriend was shaking her head at him 
 the raver hollered over his direction 
 & gt tr : <unk> now man you need to like <unk> & gt the boyfriend : <unk> 
 you.” the raver turned back to me and gave me a look 
 & gt me : “yeah 
 we’ve been listening to this sh t all night 
 i’m <unk> real f*cking sick of it.” i hopped in the back seat and hollered over to my companions 
 & gt me : “this is our ride folks 
 get in or be <unk> party <unk> the ladies hopped over to the decrepit <unk> and after a moment of <unk> the boyfriend shuffled over behind them 
 the raver strolled around to the <unk> side of his car and opened the doors for the ladies but before the boyfriend could pile in as well the raver held up his hand to stop him 
 he looked over at me for confirmation 
 all i could do was shake my head 
 the raver turned back to the boyfriend 
 & gt tr : <unk> man 
 this thing is like a friends and family <unk> and just like that the raver slammed the doors shut hopped into the <unk> seat and we took off 
 the last i saw of the boyfriend was him standing in the middle of the road arms raised to heaven shouting “what the <unk> over and over 
 *** three hours and an unbelievable amount of whiskey later photographer girl’s friend got a text that the boyfriend had been rescued by a county sheriff and was on his way back to civilization 
 he was furious with her that she had abandoned him on the side of the road and left a <unk> tirade exactly to that effect 
 the words were <unk> accusatory monstrous hateful 
 the friend was obviously distraught and went and showed photographer girl and me the <unk> of <unk> that was flooding her cell phone’s screen 
 she asked what she should say in response 
 photographer girl put her hand on her friend’s shoulder 
 & gt pg : <unk> him back whatever you think he <unk> the friend nodded and smiled and sent him back but a single letter : & gt <unk> she turned off her phone and together we all laughed and drank cheap whiskey and listened to loud music until the moon itself was tired and slipped down to bed below the <unk> tfts first time i felt i had something relevant to post : the ups at a remote office failed its self test and reported a bad battery 
 since the office is in another country we ordered a replacement from our usual retailer but had them deliver it directly to the location 
 installation was to be handled by a contractor who works for the whole building not just our office 
 so he offered to come in saturday morning to exchange the battery and we would shut down the server before just for safety 
 we were told that the battery had arrived earlier this week so i confirmed to the contractor that i would shut down the server and he could replace the battery saturday morning 
 cue phone call from the remote office this morning : & gt **office** : hi you know that battery thing that got delivered this week 
 how expensive was that 
 can you order another one 
 & gt **it** : why what happened 
 & gt **office** : we had ordered some stuff from electronics retailer for a test weighing * remote office does <unk> things so sometimes they weigh packages for customers like electronics retailer just to be sure that they are invoiced for the correct amount of <unk> to be recycled * and those arrived the same day as the battery 
 & gt so someone took all those packages to our weighing lab '' since they were all electronics stuff and after weighing we sent the packages back to the retailer 
 & gt **it** : so the battery ... & gt **office** : <unk> back to the retailer along with the other items 
 and apparently they had already arrived back at the retailer * in remote office 's country * who did n't know what to do with the battery and sent the package on to their head office * in our country * 
 & gt **it** : * laughs * ok so <unk> we will get it back from them but in the meantime we 'll order a new one for you 
 i guess i 'll also tell the contractor he wo n't be needed this saturday after all 
 do n't worry we have another ups here that needs a fresh battery soon so if we get it back we 'll use it for that one 
 **tl dr** hi that ups you ups'ed us 
 can you ups us another one because we ups'ed it away i came across another thread that reminded me of this quick story that i will share with you 
 background info i am a network admin for a k-12 school district with roots in helpdesk and regular break fix 
 a while back a teacher came to me with her chromebook so i could show her how to perform some task she was having trouble with 
 i happened to be working on my chromebook at the time so i closed mine grabbed hers and opened hers up ... nothing 
 that 's odd '' i say pressing the power button 
 that should have woken up by itself '' 
 still nothing 
 assuming the battery is dead i unplug the charger from my chromebook and plug into hers 
 the charging light quickly turns from off to <unk> to green 
 <unk> that the battery is fully charged 
 the next few minutes i spend doing things like repeatedly opening and closing the lid pressing and holding the power button as well as any other button i can find shaking it flipping it over all to no avail 
 the teacher had to get back to class so i asked if i could hold onto it and see what was happening she had assured me that she was just using it with no issues 
 i decide to crack it open since i had done just about everything i could from the outside and the battery was internal 
 i open the bottom cover ensure everything visible and accessible is secure 
 then leaving the chromebook standing on its side because the bottom was open i hit the power button 
 it works 
 well i 'm not sure what happened there but it seems to be working now 
 so i close up the bottom panel put everything back to normal open the lid and ... ... nothing 
 what the hell '' 
 with the lid of the chromebook open i lift it up and shake it thinking something is loose or moving around in there 
 suddenly it turns on all by itself 
 oh boy '' i think to myself this ca n't be good '' 
 thinking there is something <unk> or otherwise <unk> inside the chromebook bouncing around i proceed to once again take it apart 
 this time i go further removing components completely from the machine 
 over the course of the next hour i learn more about the internals of this particular model chromebook than i ever cared to know 
 not finding anything obvious i decide i should try powering it on again so i put back only what is necessary to start it up 
 once again on it 's side i press the power button and once again it comes to life 
 alright great '' 
 i say 
 i carefully lift it and <unk> it back to it 's normal orientation and as soon as i set it down the screen goes blank it 's off again 
 no response to power button nothing 
 leaving the lid open i proceed to pick it back up to turn it over and the screen comes to life 
 ok ... '' i say nervously 
 i place it back down 
 dead 
 at this time i 'm thinking that when the laptop is twisted or strained in a certain way its causing something to break or lose connection so while i hold it in the air the laptop once again powered on and responsive i start <unk> it and putting pressure on the base in different spots 
 it has no effect 
 the chromebook is still on and working perfectly 
 i place it back down and <unk> it shuts off again 
 thinking the feet are the stress point i start to lift it up slowly and when the pressure is relieved from the feet the chromebook comes back to life 
 what in the hall is going on here '' 
 but then i notice something i had n't caught before 
 every time this chromebook comes back to life it goes back to the screen it was on when it died 
 so it 's acting like its going to sleep and <unk> up each time 
 then it hits me like a ton of bricks 
 these chromebooks use a proximity sensor like a magnet to detect when the lid is closed or not vs a button or switch 
 when i closed my chromebook i set the teacher 's chromebook on top of mine 
 her chromebook was detecting my chromebooks lid therefore making it think the lid was closed to it went to sleep 
 two hours wasted but it 's a lesson i wo n't ever forget 
 i hope you enjoyed my story as much as i enjoyed telling it 
 previous defiant sat on the other side of my desk 
 i stared at the computer waiting for something interesting 
 ticket queue - empty 
 & gt defiant : ugh 
 i’m so <unk> how do you stay sane 
 & gt me : don’t worry 
 something will come up… at that moment the ticket queue shuffled another ticket into existence 
 my hand moved to click it… & gt defiant : w… w… w… wait 
 lets make this ticket more interesting okay 
 & gt me : 
 & gt defiant : if i can complete the ticket without help from you… you have to buy me lunch 
 i smiled and considered 
 defiant a <unk> of genuine interest almost worth the price of lunch 
 & gt me : what happens should you lose 
 & gt defiant : me… lose 
 defiant <unk> and jumped up from his chair to look at the ticket 
 <unk> ticket - i need to get my files off my laptop and onto a usb key for a flight this afternoon but i’ve no usb ports 
 <unk> defiant started chuckling to himself 
 ***** walking up to sassy’s desk defiant was in a much better mood 
 & gt defiant : so should we get lobster or caviar for lunch 
 & gt me : ... & gt defiant : why not both right 
 i’ve never had either but i hear they’re nice 
 defiant and i arrived at sassy’s desk she was looking frantic 
 a laptop sat in front of her her new desktop pushed to the side 
 & gt sassy : ahhh i need these work files before i leave… but <unk> working & gt defiant : you just plug in the usb drive into the <unk> and copy over the files 
 sassy clicked on the folder and the computer slowly show its contents 
 very slowly 
 defiant grabbed the usb key off the table and attempted to drag and drop the files however the usb didn’t show up 
 & gt defiant : huh 
 & gt sassy : the usb ports on that side don’t work 
 only the usb on the back does 
 defiant went to plug in the usb key in the back 
 however that port was already taken up by another usb drive 
 defiant went to unmount it… & gt sassy : no 
 dont 
 that’s my ready boost 
 if you unplug it the computer will be <unk> slow 
 & gt defiant : we need the port though… sassy crossed her arms and shook her head 
 & gt sassy : you can’t have it 
 i’m video encoding 
 if you unplug it my movies won’t be ready for my flight 
 sassy pulled out a new ipod 
 she smiled down fondly at its white scroll wheel 
 & gt defiant : okay… then… we’ll transfer all the data through the network to another computer 
 then copy it 
 & gt sassy : mmm okay 
 defiant smiled <unk> 
 however one ethernet cord later ... & gt defiant : why doesn’t the ethernet port work 
 & gt sassy : oh yeah… that died when the usb did 
 i think 
 i wanted to ask what event precipitated the <unk> and ethernet dying but i settled for watching defiant’s increasingly worried face 
 & gt defiant : okay 
 sassy 
 what <unk> work on <unk> <unk> & gt sassy : mmm actually only the back usb <unk> i think… defiant thought for a second 
 his eyes started to <unk> 
 & gt defiant : nope 
 i’m sorry 
 i can’t get your files onto the usb drive 
 & gt sassy : but i need those files for work 
 i can’t believe this i have to leave for my flight soon you can’t even get my… 
 defiant had stood up off the chair 
 i quickly took his place 
 the mouse hovered over the unmount readyboost button 
 & gt me : you need these files for work 
 & gt sassy : yes but you can’t stop readyboost or the movies won’t <unk> in <unk> <unk> readyboost 
 & gt me : stop being silly sassy 
 you <unk> these files 
 sassy was in shock 
 as i copied her files over to her usb 
 i clicked on her video encoding the complete time had <unk> 
 & gt sassy : <unk> wha… & gt me : okay copy complete 
 i was smiling as defiant and i walked back to it 
 defiant looked gloomy again 
 & gt defiant : that was hardly fair… i didn’t know you could *just* tell users to stop being silly 
 & gt me : you’ve still a lot to <unk> so 
 what are you buying *us* for lunch 
 did we decide on lobster or caviar 
 next previous i went searching for redcheer i was too annoyed to do any actual work 
 i just started opening every door 
 i found a bunch of rooms i didn’t know existed 
 i found a <unk> which had an entire case of coffee 
 i considered it my heaven till i realised it was all instant 
 eventually i opened the door to a room i thought was a broom closet 
 redcheer sat inside 
 it was a broom closet 
 & gt me : what… are you.. doing in here 
 the red haired lady sat with a two computer tower setup inside surrounded by <unk> and other cleaning equipment 
 & gt redcheer : oh airz 
 finally 
 i was looking for you didn’t anyone tell you 
 & gt me : they told me you were looking for me but why are you in a broom closet 
 & gt redcheer : oh.. i was working on getting my computer back up and running 
 i looked at the scene before me 
 two computers had been setup side by side in a tiny <unk> & gt me : why again did you choose a broom closet to setup in 
 & gt redcheer : i think a design meeting is on today 
 i didn’t want to be distracted 
 anyway take a look at what i’ve done 
 i <unk> down and looked at the two screens in the small space 
 & gt me : haha i was forced to go to that meeting for you 
 & gt redcheer : was it fun 
 i opened up the start bar on one of the computers many design programs had been installed 
 & gt me : not too bad 
 apart from the annoying dread and scarfy 
 & gt redcheer : oh <unk> they do 
 this was probably the already working computer i moved my attention to the other screen 
 i opened the start bar 
 & gt me : just complaining about my fixes 
 & gt redcheer : they did what 
 i looked up at redcheer’s face she seemed oddly incensed 
 the start bar of the second computer on the other hand did not incense <unk> 
 it was perfect 
 & gt me : which <unk> 
 is your one 
 redcheer smiled at me 
 she seemed happy i couldn’t tell which one she’d imaged 
 & gt redcheer : that one is 
 it’s good huh 
 after you didn’t show up i called our usual tech and he talked me through the basics 
 pointed me to some good websites and stuff 
 & gt me : haha i didn’t show up because i didn’t expect you to be hiding in here 
 & gt redcheer : well telling people to tell you i’m in the broom closet kinda <unk> the purpose of hiding in the broom closet 
 i couldn’t really argue that point 
 i was happy i’d found redcheer <unk> less boring when there’s someone to talk to 
 & gt me : your <unk> it’s perfect 
 you even transferred the license keys over this must have taken you all morning 
 an small error popped up in the corner of the screen 
 & gt <unk> disk <unk> & gt you are running out of disk space on system c : … uh huh 
 & gt redcheer : yeah that keeps happening 
 & gt me : not great 
 i opened up the properties of the hard disk 
 it was full 
 completely full 
 i remembered back to when the original hard disk was broke 
 i never looked at the capacity of the disk redcheer had put in to replace it 
 the replacement disc wasn’t <unk> & gt redcheer : can you fix it 
 & gt me : don’t worry 
 i 've got this 
 i started mentally planning pulling this disc out replacing it with a new larger one and reimaging the entire thing 
 & gt redcheer : what did dread and scarfy complain about at the meeting anyway 
 & gt me : oh nothing much they just want no plastic bags on the internet <unk> i thought about asking redcheer to do the imaging after all she’d done a good job with this one 
 i decided against it it was my job after all 
 & gt redcheer : oh yeah dread has a thing about that 
 don’t worry 
 i 've got this 
 she gave me a massive smile and dragged me out of the broom closet 
 as i walked away from the closet i saw the low disk space error pop up in the start bar again 
 poor computer 
 next previous i look down at the tea placed in my hand 
 & gt me : tea 
 another heads of department meeting was starting around me 
 & gt vp : tea 
 i looked down at the liquid in my cup 
 i took a sip 
 & gt me : yep 
 tea 
 & gt vp : nice you see you’re being so <unk> of the new security manager 
 & gt me : i didn’t ask for… 
 the words stopped coming out of my mouth as i looked over at the vp 's secretary 
 she was <unk> **just go with it** at me from behind the vp’s shoulder 
 & gt me : ahem i didn’t ask for such a delightful tea i sure am glad i asked for it 
 the vp’s secretary smiled gave me a thumbs up and left the room 
 the vp looked at me oddly 
 almost <unk> 
 & gt vp : mmm seems you are becoming a real team player airz 
 lets hear what our new business consultant thinks of it 
 & gt con : yes well after implementing the new review system we’ve had some good results 
 i took another sip of my drink 
 the word good didn’t cover it 
 glowing perhaps 
 & gt vp : so what’s next 
 & gt con : i think people are a little afraid of speaking out against it 
 so we’re opening an anonymous review system 
 anyone can post inside with ideas complains suggestions 
 i looked down at my drink 
 this wasn’t coffee i wouldn’t stand for it 
 & gt me : a complaints box 
 really 
 & gt con : no darling no 
 an ideas box 
 & gt me : okay firstly darling 
 complaints shouldn’t be anonymous how can we fix a problem if we don’t know where its happening 
 & gt con : just try it 
 for me 
 & gt me : for what 
 & gt vp : i thought you where turning the corner with a team focus airz 
 & gt me : i… i looked over at the vp 's secretary outside the glass window 
 she mouthed **go with it** 
 as i stared down at my tea and realized none of the meeting rooms were <unk> i decided to go all in 
 & gt me : i can’t wait to see how this goes 
 i gave the best smile i could muster with tea in my hands 
 & gt vp : oh and we’ll get those it keys off you to cut for security 
 i looked to the tea for strength 
 my smile wouldn’t <unk> 
 even as i burnt to the ground i’d smile 
 next hi all so brief overview i work at my universities computer <unk> repair desk and <unk> 
 let the tale commence 
 so i 'm at the counter when a middle aged woman comes in and states & gt lady : i got a computer here and you need to help me install office '' & gt me : sure thing did you order it through us '' 
 & gt lady : yes should n't you know that '' 
 do you think i can <unk> every order that comes in 
 but regardless i go out back and get her computer on the receipt i see a ticket showing her computer had also been prepped so a random password was set to the system 
 and recorded on the ticket for a first login 
 & gt me : here you are ma'am if you 'd like help installing office i can assist but you 're going to need to change your password upon logging in 
 so i 'm going to do task while you do that '' & gt lady : upon being handed her receipt with her <unk> what 's this my receipt '' does n't look at it and begins <unk> it up and where am i going to install office here 
 you want me to stand '' 
 & gt me : do n't <unk> that it 's not just your receipt it 's also your password 
 and yes installing office takes about 15 minutes '' 
 & gt lady : how was i supposed to know this had my password on it '' 
 anyways she gets logged in and changes the default password 
 but then i took over to help connect her to the school 's wifi 
 & gt lady : upon my opening network connections what are you doing there 
 how was i supposed to know how to do all this by myself all the it help in my department is busy '' & gt me : i 'm just connecting you to the internet 
 you 'll need to login with your school credentials '' 
 & gt lady : as she 's logging in what 's that the mouse just moved my last computer had this problem 
 that 's why i got this one '' & gt me : you 're letting your wrists hit the <unk> while typing 
 it 's not the computer '' 
 & gt lady : oh no so am i going to always remember to keep my wrists from touching it '' 
 & gt me : yes or maybe you could get an external keyboard from your department '' & gt lady : ok i work in it so i should be able to get one '' 
 it took a minute for what she said to sink in but then i thought 
 wait she works in it and has no idea how to install a simple piece of software 
 and she claims no one else in it can help her either 
 but aside from the obvious questions going through my mind the rest of the install went the same way 
 i click something and she questions how in the world she was supposed to know how to accept terms and agreement or other equivalent task 
 after she left i looked her up in the system and she 's gotten a new computer every year from the department on the claims that her previous one was broken '' 
 at that point i let my head hit the counter with enough force to measure on the <unk> scale 
 tl dr how am i supposed to know how to post this 
 it 's the post button you say well how was i expected to know that i am a semi retired semi burnt out old tech working through my declining years in a small rural town 
 in a small town you take on just about anything and i was called to one of the local <unk> to work on a video game 
 it was a cabinet that used s dell pc with a custom program 
 i was called in because there was a connectivity problem the game needed to connect to a server to update the games performance 
 i replaced the faulty wi-fi card 
 it was a simple repair and i would not normally mention it on this forum but i had to re-enter the wi-fi settings 
 this pc had no keyboard or mouse so you used one of the <unk> '' to shoot at the screen to select the keys on the on screen keyboard 
 did i mention it was a hunting game 
 so with a huge grin i quickly shot in the settings and the job was done 
 tldr a dream come true i got to program a pc with a <unk> '' i work in a school 
 i love my job 
 the staff and i get along great 
 i require that if they need assistance that they email me at helpdesk @ <unk> 
 yesterday was april <unk> and here are some of the tickets i received

 it seems to be eating my words and leaving <unk> 
 -english teacher previous roll out the line of managers stretched to eternity 
 each eagerly awaiting a pda to be handed out to them 
 i sighed louder each time a device left the room 
 & gt acchead : oh yes 
 i’ve been waiting for this… the accounting head <unk> <unk> the device from my hard 
 he lovingly stared down upon its glowing screen 
 & gt me : any questions about your new pda 
 & gt acchead : not really 
 does it have a name 
 i handed over the box that came with the device the model proudly displayed in large writing across the front 
 & gt acchead : no not a model 
 i mean like an individual name 
 & gt me : its a pda 
 just call it pda 
 acchead held the <unk> <unk> in head and gently poked and prodded at the various icons 
 & gt acc : pda stands for assistant yeah 
 & gt me : sure 
 i sighed loudly watching another manager leave swiftly with two boxes in hand 
 & gt acc : <unk> should have individual names 
 they’re like helpers 
 & gt me : mmm if you’ve got no questions… 
 i held my hand up to gesture the door hoping the hint was obvious 
 the head of accounting slowly turned and headed towards the door 
 he looked fondly down at the pda in his hand 
 & gt acc : sally 
 i think i’ll name you sally 
 i sighed loudly as he exited 
 ***** a few hours later the <unk> line of managers had turned into more of a <unk> 
 <unk> of people came to collect devices it was much less stressful 
 i’d even managed to control my sighs as people left 
 & gt acchead : help me 
 help 
 <unk> in trouble 
 the head of accounting rushed into it he was holding his pda like a baby 
 redcheer rushed over to see the distress accountant as i <unk> from my office 
 & gt redcheer : what’s happened to sally 
 & gt acchead : she’s cracked her face open 
 she fell down some stairs 
 the colour drained from the faces of the people listening in 
 redcheer looked on high alert ready to <unk> 
 & gt redcheer : oh god 
 where is she 
 & gt me : give it here… i held out my hand and took the head accountants pda from him 
 the whole of it looked confused 
 & gt redcheer : what are you doing 
 & gt me : this is sally 
 he named his pda 
 i held the pda in the air for everyone to see 
 its screen smashed completely 
 oddly the office went from alert and <unk> to calm and non caring in an instant 
 even redcheer swiftly sat down looking bored 
 & gt acchead : i don’t know how it happened 
 one minute it was in my hands then … it was at the bottom of the stairs 
 & gt me : you dropped it 
 & gt acchead : drop sally 
 i would never 
 i stared <unk> down at the head accountant who meekly mumbled 
 & gt acchead : any chance of getting it fixed 
 & gt me : we’ve spares luckily 
 however you’re gon na have to fill out a few forms 
 ***** as i handed the head accountant his second pda of the day he looked down at it with fond <unk> 
 & gt acchead : i think i’ll name this one sally 2 
 & gt me : … & gt acchead : no you’re right 
 that’s weird 
 this one will be sarah 
 as the head of accounting made his way to the it door i picked up his old and broken pda 
 i flipped the device over to pull out the battery 
 on the back cover <unk> all that way across the device in large letters 
 <unk> & gt me : <unk> 
 what the hell is this 
 he was gone 
 i let out an <unk> sigh 
 next so my coworker who was also a tech support recently quit his job at our company so we had a new job posting up on our company website for a new it support person 
 on the posting there is a apply now link that is actually an email link the <unk> : xxxxx @ <unk> '' format that the applicants use to send their <unk> straight to my manager 's mailbox 
 because we got some applicants in the past complain the link did n't work because they did n't know it was an email hyperlink we added some instructions underneath the apply now link on every posting in big red bold text that basically says that if you do n't use a desktop email client like outlook then copy and paste the link right click the link and copy shortcut in ie or copy email address in chrome on to your gmail <unk> whatever other email service you use 
 most people understand that and send in their <unk> just fine 
 but one day this guy with a really thick accent ca n't tell from where but it 's really thick and i can barely understand him called the reception and complained that he can not apply for the it support position and that the link is broken 
 the receptionist that answered the call forwarded the call to me because everything it related goes to me for some reason and i answered the call note that i work at an internal helpdesk so i do n't get any external clients calling unless it 's our vendors or something 
 so the conversation goes something like this : & gt $ guy : hi i try to apply for the it network technical support position on your website but it is not working 
 & gt $ me : did you click the apply now link on the posting 
 & gt $ guy : yes but it does n't work 
 & gt $ me : can you tell me how the apply now link does n't work 
 & gt $ guy : i click the link and error appears 
 & gt $ me : and what does the error say 
 & gt $ guy : something about the default mail client is not properly installed '' & gt $ me : <unk> % sure his email client is n't set up* then what email service do you use 
 gmail 
 & gt $ guy : yes gmail 
 *sigh* & gt $ me : the apply now link is actually an email address 
 if you use gmail read the instructions under the apply now link on how to copy the email and paste it in gmail 
 $ guy does n't understand and repeats the same thing about how the link does n't work and something about sending it to another email address in our company 
 i repeat the same thing and tell him to follow the instructions and send it again 
 he gives up and says he 'll try again and hangs up 
 i thought to myself : if you ca n't even solve your own it problems how are you going to solve the it problems for our staff 
 a few days later i asked my manager and he said he did n't get any email from $ guy 
 guess he still did n't figure it <unk> while back my company sent me to our uk office just outside of london 
 i was to be there for a month do some training see how things were run and help with one of our call centres 
 one of the consumer support guys was on the <unk> with a guy on the east coast and was reading out a registration key to him 
 three one five <unk> <unk> yankee and so on 
 he says yankee and the guy frigging lost it and started going on about independence parties that involve tea the queen and so on 
 we 're all having a good <unk> over this and the rep transfers that call to me 
 'hello this is <unk> how can i help you 
 <unk> of your guys called me a yankee 'i see 
 sir do you have internet access 
 'yes of course 
 'please open up a browser and go to the <unk> 'ok 'now google the nato phonetic alphabet please 
 'ok i have it what am i looking for 
 <unk> me the phonetic <unk> for the letters f q i and y <unk> <unk> india and ... sigh yankee 
 <unk> else sir 
 'no thank you but it 's always nice to speak to another american you never know who you 're going to get these days <unk> sir i 'm <unk> 
 transferred him back and the support rep got him <unk> work as one-man it for a small company 
 a coworker walks over to my cubicle and drops a laptop on my desk 
 hey <unk> this is my personal laptop and it does n't work 
 i spoke with your non-it boss and he said i could give it to you to fix since i do company work on it '' 
 well generally i do n't support <unk> hardware unless it 's something work-related that 's not working like your vpn 
 what 's wrong with it '' 
 i dunno it crashed '' 
 so it just does n't turn on at all '' 
 <unk> <unk> no it just comes up black '' 
 so it 's the computer itself that is n't working not something related to work '' 
 yeah '' 
 okay ... since it 's not a company machine i unfortunately ca n't fix it '' 
 but i use it for work '' 
 <unk> work in several small offices with a consulting firm 
 there are no <unk> of stories but here 's a quick one that happened recently 
 following a recent sale mr. sales sent an e-mail to a couple customers with some remaining stock 
 attached is a .zip file said to contain photos from the items that must be sold 
 our short story starts already in progress : & gt sales : are you in the office today 
 & gt it : yes i 'm two doors down from him & gt sales : could you come over here for a minute 
 & gt it : sure ... i walk over ... & gt sales : hr says i just sent the network drive to the <unk> from the sale 
 & gt it : let 's take a look ... & gt sales : maybe i 'll just forward it to you instead ... i go back to my desk and wait 
 as a small business hr is included in the customer service e-mail address along with accounting marketing and a couple dedicated customer service people 
 eventually as he comes and goes a couple of times the e-mail comes in 
 it 's a normal .zip file with several photos 
 we walk downstairs to try to see what hr was concerned about 
 & gt hr : see 
 the entire network drive can be accessed straight from this e-mail 
 she had the .zip file open and was clicking on the network drive directly from the explorer sidebar 
 we 've been on windows 7 for three years now 
 almost gave sales a heart attack but at least we got a mildly interesting story out of it one of the many stories from my time as a level 1 and 2 tech support for the education department 
 here is one with me and a female primary school teacher **teacher** : *almost in tears <unk> help me please 
 **me** : what can i do for you 
 **teacher** : well one of my kids was being naughty so i threatened to put him in the naughty corner 
 he then threatened that he would hack my computer and he bloody has 
 **me** : what do you mean by hacking 
 **teacher** : he 's broken the computer and given it all viruses 
 he 's refusing to tell me what he did 
 after managing to get a word in i remoted into the computer turns out the kid had <unk> the colours and changed the language ... smart kid 
 i work part time in a call center where we do both <unk> and technical support for our client a mobile carrier in north america 
 on the weekend i 'm one of the few supervisor in charge for the <unk> department in our relatively small center on <unk> we do n't usually treat second level escalation because we 're not enough on the floor but in this case i decided to take care of it because it seem so far fetched and also because the complaint was against one of our agent and we do n't like these escalations <unk> and prefer to take care of them ourselves 
 so yesterday i get a call from one of the live supervisor on the floor who 's speaking with $ <unk> who 's claiming that we have provide him with $ 1000 as he was promised by a technical support agent the evening before 
 the customer is not clear with the details to the supervisor and request that we listen to the call 
 usually we ca n't being a contractor only our own internal calls are available 
 lucky for him the tech support agent is one of ours so the call is already available for listening 
 i ask the 1st level supervisor to put the customer on hold while i investigate the call 
 this is what i can recall from the <unk> minutes call & gt ** $ luckycustomer** : i 'm tired that your application always shows big data discrepancies my phone shows me that i 'm at <unk> while your app only shows <unk> 
 i never get the automated warning in time 
 & gt ** $ generousagent** : well it 's not a very big discrepancy it 's only 50mb 
 & gt ** $ luckycustomer** : hum no it 's half a gig 
 & gt ** $ generousagent** : <unk> not at all after the <unk> it 's megabytes in this case only <unk> to be exact 
 & gt ** $ luckycustomer** : i do n't think so no 
 i 'm no idiot i work it and my brother is an engineer we both can confirm to you that it 's 500mb you 're mistaken 
 & gt ** $ generousagent** : let me speak to your brother i will explain it to him actually go on google and if you can prove me that 7.44 and 7.97 is close to half a gb we will give you $ 1000 the call is recorded 
 & gt ** $ luckycustomer** : what did you just say 
 $ 1000 
 & gt ** $ generousagent** : yes if you can prove that we will credit your account for $ 1000 dollar you just need to prove it which is impossible 
 & gt ** $ luckycustomer** : alright just let me get something *customer puts the agent on <unk> phone and comes back with something to record him* say that again 
 & gt ** $ generousagent** : if you can prove us that 7.44 and 7.97 is close to half a gb we will give you a credit of $ 1000 
 & gt ** $ luckycustomer** : alright like you said the call is recorded i also recorded that part 
 i 'll be calling later to claim this amount to client care 
 & gt ** $ generousagent** : like i said it 's impossible 
 but if you do prove it send us the proof and we 'll apply the credit 
 & gt ** $ luckycustomer** : ok thank you and have a good day 
 & gt ** $ generousagent** : have a good day 
 i 'm sitting there listening to the call and having to find a way to tell the customer that there 's no way we can apply that sort of credit from a promise from an <unk> agent who does n't understand <unk> very well ... i took the call and basically told the customer while he was right the agent had no authorization to offer this type of credit ... in the end i had to set up an escalation from our highest level available in the center 
 i guess ** $ luckycustomer** will probably get his credit and i 'm not sure how long ** $ generousagent** will keep his job 
 the vp’s voice rung in my ear as i turned up to an unfamiliar workplace for the first time 
 i’d been told to look for ways of <unk> two it departments whilst simultaneously getting to know the new staff we’d just acquired 
 i put on a large smile on my face as i entered the it department 
 it actually looked quite tidy and orderly two it staff looked up at me from there desks as i entered 
 & gt greyit : you must be the new hire 
 & gt me : new hire 
 no i’m the it manager from the company you’ve just merged with… 
 & gt youngit : merged <unk> 
 i looked around and spotted an empty desk so i walked over to put down all my stuff 
 the two men in the room seemed to watch <unk> 
 & gt me : so … 
 mentally i screamed at the vp who’d taken the manager from this office and placed him in charge of my own for a few months 
 this place felt completely foreign 
 & gt greyit : so newbie today i think we’ll start you with cleaning out the storage closet 
 & gt me : ahem sorry you must be confused i’ll introduce myself 
 i’m airz i come from the company you’ve just merged with 
 i’ve come to manage this office for a while and work out how to better integrate this team as we move you over to our buildings 
 youngit looked startled at the <unk> that they’d be moving greyit however was <unk> eyed 
 & gt greyit : okay newbie <unk> first then cleaning 
 i’m greyit and this is youngit 
 the closet is over that way anything you want to throw out just run it past me 
 okay 
 it was as if he was trying some mind trick 
 i looked at him blankly wondering if he was just perhaps just thick 
 & gt greyit : hello 
 … newbie the closet is that way 
 he waved at me like i was the thick one 
 i decided it had to stop 
 & gt me : okay stop calling me newbie 
 i’m currently the manager of this office now unless you want to be assigned the cleaning duties i’d lay off 
 youngit smirked at greyit who looked taken aback that someone was standing up to him 
 & gt greyit : you’re the newest member of this office 
 it’s tradition to call the newest <unk> 
 & gt me : unfortunately that tradition stops when that person is your senior 
 & gt greyit : senior 
 i’m older then you 
 i sighed and decided not to rub the fact i meant in position in his face 
 he clearly wanted to be a boss or at least boss someone around 
 & gt me : okay where’s the ticketing software 
 & gt greyit : youngit you show him the <unk> 
 i aint got time to show round a newbie 
 he shook his head and got back to whatever he was doing on his computer 
 i decided to just let him go 
 youngit smiled at me as he walked over 
 & gt youngit : okay so this is your email and this is the knowledge base where you look up any problems and now we just wait for a call or someone to walk in the door 
 & gt me : which program runs your tickets 
 & gt youngit : tickets 
 what are tickets 
 greyit finally decided to spin round on his chair 
 he looked at me angrily 
 & gt greyit : we don’t do tickets here 
 people come to us with problems newbie 
 & gt me : stop calling me newbie 
 & gt greyit : well when you learn how an it department runs you wouldn’t be such a newbie 
 i <unk> from reprimanding greyit on calling me a newbie making a huge fuss over something so small on the first day never <unk> well 
 i turned back to youngit 
 & gt me : so no tickets 
 youngit looked confused but shook his head 
 & gt me : oh … & gt youngit : don’t worry we have emails 
 youngit opened up the email client the list of emails already in my inbox was <unk> 
 & gt youngit : when you complete a job just hit reply all and type done into the reply 
 that tells us all you’ve <unk> the job 
 & gt me : i’ve already got <unk> emails 
 isn’t this a new account 
 & gt youngit : it gets resent every job it hasn’t completed every few hours 
 so we don’t miss any 
 i could already think of a hundred things wrong with this system 
 youngit seemed to <unk> in explaining every aspect of it though 
 i let him talk 
 eventually a lady walked into the department youngit prompted me to take the inquiry 
 & gt fright : oh hello 
 are you new 
 & gt me : yep 
 what can it do for you 
 & gt fright : my computer won’t print 
 just errors continuously 
 & gt me : i guess lets go take a look 
 i started to make my way towards the door but fright didn’t seem to move 
 & gt fright : don’t worry i’ve brought it down 
 & gt behind fright a desktop and printer combination sat on a trolley 
 it looked like someone had taken great care to bring every cord with it 
 the trolley was loaded with various cords and <unk> 
 & gt fright : hopefully i’ve got the right cords i sort of need this done quickly 
 & gt me : next time maybe leave it all in place and we’ll come to you… 
 greyit shouted at me from across the room 
 & gt greyit : wait airz 
 stop 
 i’ll take this one 
 he rushed over and stood between me and fright 
 i was so surprised he’d called me airz i decided to just let him 
 as i walked back to my desk i listened to the end of the interaction 
 & gt greyit : sorry about that so you’re not printing 
 don’t worry we’ll sort this out 
 & gt fright : what did that other guy say about coming up and not having to bring everything to it 
 & gt greyit : he’s the newbie doesn’t know what he’s talking about i’m afraid 
 no no the best way to get things done quickly is the it department 
 i mean think about it… thats where all the fixing machines are 
 fright seemed to accept that as fact and smiled as greyit spent his time plugging the computer in 
 i stared with incredulity at all the <unk> 
 i seemed to be in shock for a while and was only brought out of it when youngit brought me a coffee 
 & gt me : youngit is everything diagnosed down here 
 nothing is ever done on the floor 
 my question however was answered only moments later as an exhausted secretary pushed a massive full height printer into the department 
 she gave it one last <unk> through the door then exclaimed loudly 
 & gt <unk> : printer for floor 2 
 it’s out of ink or something again 
 previous nice was smiling brightly as we walked back to my office 
 & gt nice : woo 
 that was great 
 it 's always good to get some work done 
 what 's next for today 
 & gt defiant : great 
 defiant was scowling as he absentmindedly <unk> his forehead 
 he did n't seem to enjoy the help desk 
 & gt nice : let 's do some stocktaking 
 that 's so <unk> maybe even you 'll enjoy it defiant 
 & gt me : stocktaking ... <unk> my eyes <unk> over to the store room 
 it was fairly tidy 
 & gt nice : yeah there 's got to somewhere that needs cleaning 
 & gt me : er 
 nah 
 i think everything 's clean 
 i caught a glimpse of the cleaning closet '' filled with old it equipment with no where to go 
 i decided not to mention it 
 & gt defiant : we could just check everything is in the right place 
 & gt me : cleaning should wait ... tickets first 
 i dove to the computer searching for a ticket to distract everyone 
 nice however had spotted the cleaning closet 
 & gt nice : woah 
 look at this room 
 it 's a mess 
 & gt me : dammit 
 i reluctantly walked over to the closet 
 whilst walking i spotted solitaire teaching hesitant about <unk> hosts 
 i wondered why i could n't have such a good <unk> student 
 & gt defiant : wow 
 look at all this old stuff 
 & gt me : we probably should n't <unk> it 
 it all needs throwing out but we 've been ordered to keep it 
 all this old stuff is a cursed 
 nice started looking through the boxes 
 defiant started inspecting all the old computers in the room 
 & gt me : defiant did n't you want to avoid physical stuff 
 i can go get some fun tickets ... & gt defiant : nah it 's okay 
 this is fun 
 i frowned as i looked around at all the cursed it gear 
 abandoned hardware from projects that failed or stalled 
 & gt me : man this place is ... & gt defiant : awesome 
 & gt nice : dusty 
 & gt me : ... depressing 
 eventually nice and defiant convinced me to help clean 
 i was n't <unk> 
 i send defiant down to get some boxes from recycling so we could box and label equipment 
 i half expected him to return empty handed knowing the cleaners 
 however surprisingly he arrived back with an entire cart of boxes 
 & gt defiant : those cleaners tried to convince me they got a rebate for cardboard 
 & gt nice : wait ... do we get a rebate 
 & gt defiant : haha hell no 
 i still ca n't believe they tried fast talking me 
 i 'm the fast talking king 
 i laughed at defiant but tried to stifle it with my hand 
 luckily he did n't notice 
 we started working & amp slowly we worked our way through the room 
 & gt nice : hey what 's this 
 & gt defiant : it looks cool 
 i examined the box they were holding 
 it was filled with palm <unk> 's 
 & gt me : old pda 's 
 junk nowadays 
 & gt defiant : can i ... have one 
 i shrugged 
 i was surprised when defiant reached in and the first one he tried to turn on sprung to life 
 he took the pda and a charging dock and excited plugged them in 
 he started playing with it immediately 
 & gt nice : pretty retro 
 what can they do 
 & gt me : mostly just a diary maybe document reader 
 nice stared at the device almost longingly 
 & gt nice : can i ... & gt me : just take one 
 nice took one with a dock and quickly ran off 
 i smiled as i looked around the tidy room 
 job done 
 i decided the curse of the old equipment had lifted with the clean 
 ***** the next day i sat in my office watching defiant happily tap away with his new old toy 
 & gt me : yesterdays cleaning was n't so bad normally that room leads to headaches 
 & gt defiant : yeah 
 it was great ... defiant went back to busily tapping on his palm 
 i decided to check my emails 
 my inbox was filled 
 **new email** it i 've seen the events manager with a new it device thing 
 it has a screen and stuff 
 looks useful 
 when do accounts get them 
 -- accounting head 
 **new email** airz nice was showing a large screen diary yesterday 
 she said she got it from it 
 would it be possible to get one also 
 -- <unk> & gt me : fantastic 
 i dreaded the future calls to it to get various programs working on the now ancient palm 's 
 i started to prepare a generic reply however i was stopped by a knock at the door 
 & gt solitaire : hey airz i noticed defiant here has a palm 
 i was wondering if i could also get one ... & gt me : i knew that room was cursed 
 i should never have touched it 
 & gt solitaire : sorry 
 what 
 my mind screamed burn them all '' but my body just shrugged 
 next it apprentice - supporting over 1200 users so im sitting here at my desk reading reddit when a user comes into the office saying the new managing directors pc is n't <unk> she is panicking and <unk> so this is how it <unk> user : <unk> me : me- u - help he is getting angry and his pc wont work ... me - ok.. have you made sure its plugged into the extension lead <unk> u - of course i have im not an idiot me - okay ill come over now 
 so i get up from my desk and walk over to the md 's <unk> sure enough it was plugged in i have a look at the extension lead and notice the light was no on.. the occasionally blow a bulb i then trail the extension lead back and i find its not plugged into the socket 
 whilst doing this i have the md watching my every move and for someone that is 16 i find it <unk> me - <unk> the extension lead is not plugged in.. u - oh <unk> md - this was a test to see how fast you react to <unk> you can now leave 
 so moral of the story he may be a managing director of a global company but he does n't know how to plug an extension lead in.. <unk> managing director not doctor for <unk> telco is currently testing 1gbps links for deployment sometimes this decade - maybe 
 in our labs and our internal network we 're already testing these 
 it 's sweet but ... & gt boss : hey bytewave 
 i got an automated email from systems internal it saying you tripped an alarm 
 could it be related to our private server 
 here 's a copy '' 
 & gt bytewave : you 're kidding me 
 unrelated 
 this is the alarm that was set up a decade ago after someone <unk> <unk> from frontline 's tech lab and then another tried to literally send spam from their workstation remember '' 
 & gt boss : ... oh yeah 
 i did n't know we still had that 
 it 's volume based right '' 
 & gt bytewave : yeah ... based on numbers that seemed right a decade ago 
 now that we have a 1gbps link hitting the target takes like 2 minutes '' 
 & gt boss : yeah ... i guess it 's okay for frontline but.. anyhow whatever you sent or received was dozens of gigs 
 i do n't mean to pry but ... '' & gt bytewave : pry away 
 remember during the last network outage when you asked me to troubleshoot <unk> an alarm system - for which i have no training and is not a product we sell 
 that i somehow fixed anyway '' 
 & gt boss : yeah 
 thanks again for that '' 
 & gt bytewave : i did it by reading on the thing on wikipedia 
 using a test phone with a sim from our competitor <unk> 
 if they knew we could only fix something thanks to them they 'd have a damn commercial about it 
 anyhow i figured we should keep a copy on our server from now on - with the new drives there 's plenty of space '' 
 & gt boss : a copy of wikipedia '' 
 & gt bytewave : yes 
 i downloaded <unk> in both languages our portal has already been updated with links 
 it 's not that big for the amount of useful info it has - we have a few spare terabytes 
 i put it on the <unk> drive and on a <unk> thumbdrive 
 so you 're saying it tripped an alarm at systems 
 when they gave us 1gbps connections did they intend for us to use it or just stare at speedtest.net and <unk> a little '' 
 & gt boss : you did right 
 but i ca n't tell systems it 's on our shadow server 
 i 'll tell them we put it on a thumbdrive for emergency purposes and all will be fine 
 thanks '' 
 & gt bytewave : systems might be happy but i 'm not 
 you do n't give me a 1gbps link and then call my boss the second i actually use it 
 mind if i take down the automated usage alerts for our department '' 
 & gt boss : ... sure that 's really <unk> but what could we do about it 
 that 's run by systems right '' 
 & gt bytewave : i have my people at systems 
 let me call gregory '' 
 gregory was first featured in this old tale 
 & gt gregory : systems '' 
 & gt bytewave : hey greg 
 bytewave tsss 
 i need to know how that old in-house alarm for <unk> of the internal network works '' 
 & gt gregory : hey man 
 it 's just an alert sent pretty wide if any workstation at any department that falls under tech support or sales reaches <unk> <unk> within a 48 hour period '' 
 & gt bytewave : that 's actually less unreasonable than i feared but with the new 1gbps links senior staff has it 's been accidentally tripped without valid cause '' 
 & gt gregory : just by senior staff or frontline too '' 
 & gt bytewave : just us '' 
 & gt gregory : <unk> 
 taking your accounts and your labs out of the alarm 
 both tsss and sss 
 do you need me to raise the cap too '' 
 ... if only there were twenty guys like gregory at systems internal it would actually function without a hitch ... & gt bytewave : nah cap is fine for frontline 
 thank you for taking us out the list man 
 see you at lunch '' 
 boss nodded looking very happy 
 now i get to actually use and test that damn link without alarms 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 this was back in the days of me being a code-monkey for a company about 4 years ago 
 the cio who was a <unk> idiot who <unk> a raid into a constantly failing server drive was known for not knowing crap 
 they have a massive <unk> server when the size of the organization could easily survive on a single server rack if properly configured 
 an org with less than 30 people has a dedicated in house exchange server with the cio 's <unk> spam filter in place oh boy i got stories about the failure that pos was ... <unk> were done monthly and were kept in the same room 
 mainly the whole thing was designed to fail 
 even just on the hardware side the cio was an idiot 
 on the software side he was an even bigger idiot 
 he claimed to be a <unk> guy but he was actually a <unk> guy 
 everything he wrote <unk> 
 hated c. so cio decided to build this online tool where clients would be able to create their own ads 
 the whole tool was a disaster that used a grid system like <unk> '' ... anyways since i was the <unk> code-monkey i got the <unk> to alpha the pos 
 sample data was given to us in a word document to input into an ad 
 which i did 
 20 minutes later boom alarms everywhere people scrambling children screaming dogs and <unk> living together 
 finally one of the programmers ran to me 
 did you just put a <unk> character into the new ad tool '' 
 he said accusingly 
 i said i copy and pasted the text from the word doc '' 
 apparently word docs have an <unk> of line character that 's invisible and is considered a <unk> character which caused me to escape the ad tool 's text input meaning the rest of the text string i copy/pasted in was being read as code not a sentence to <unk> 
 yeah they tried to pin it on me until i pointed out most our customers use word and would 've copy/pasted in <unk> characters eventually 
 tl dr <unk> your inputs blah first time poster blah blah blah user ... having worked as an it support person during move in my favorite was the dad who was upset because he could n't set up his server in his daughters room 
 our networking team was always aggressive about blocking <unk> servers on the network 
 cast : ad = angry dad me = me & gt ad : why am i not allowed to set up my daughter 's computer in her dorm 
 & gt me : *thinking that he means a <unk> you are allowed to set it up sir just make certain you follow the getting started guide that we put in her room 
 & gt ad : i did then if stopped talking to the network 
 why 
 <unk> out the long rant about how much he 's paying for his daughter to attend & gt me : *thinking that he did n't bother to read the instructions and rather than <unk> the point i decided to follow him upstairs to <unk> ad walks me in and points to his daughter 's desktop computer '' which is actually a server rack complete with a couple of servers a network switch and what i believe is a decent raid array 
 & gt me : um sir you 're not allowed to treat your daughter 's dorm room like a server closet 
 that will have to go 
 <unk> : daughter is sitting on her bed during this time <unk> the facebook on her laptop 
 & gt ad : <unk> do you know how much money i 'm paying for her to go here 
 & gt me : money has nothing to do with this 
 you ca n't do this and it will have to go 
 & gt ad : f & amp <unk> you 
 at this point rather than argue i decided to let campus security take care of this and walk out 
 i call the special number we have for security and inform them of the situation 
 an hour later i laugh quietly as he is <unk> several boxes and an empty server rack back to his truck 
 turns out he saw that our campus had access to internet 2 and thought that he could just plug his business server up to our network and instantly have faster data speeds without having to pay for it 
 tl dr : daddy will gladly pay for his daughter to join a <unk> but is too cheap to pay for his own server room 
 one day at my telco a new low-level suit asks me a favor while i 'm getting a coffee refill 
 & gt new suit : so i need to send a few faxes but these machines hate me hah 
 senior staff right 
 can you help me do it '' 
 & gt bytewave : yes i am no i ca n't 
 rules are a bit strict 
 handling the faxes of management is part of the job description of the union secretaries i 'm sure hr explained all the <unk> when you took the job 
 you 'd be getting your first grievance in your first week 
 go see one of them they 'll be happy to '' 
 & gt new suit : oh right ... i tried it 's just they 're on this <unk> this afternoon we 're all out so obviously there 's nobody to handle it '' 
 & gt bytewave : .. it 's a fax machine 
 if my cleaning maid calls in sick i can still operate a vacuum cleaner 
 what can be so complicated '' 
 <unk> my <unk> curiosity for an interest in helping him out he beams and pulls out six letters and.. a <unk> of voided cheques 
 & gt new suit : yeah i really need to move all my stuff to this new bank account and you know how it is <unk> wants a copy old and new banks credit card company bills ... '' & gt bytewave : hang on i thought this was at least work-related ... '' ... & gt bytewave : nevermind now i 'm curious 
 why do you have six voided cheques in hand and ... '' i look carefully at the letter he 's hoping to fax along ... it 's a nicely formatted explanation followed by his contact information account numbers and everything related to identification at six different companies 
 the six are identical copies 
 & gt bytewave : ... i 'm going to advise you to send a different document to each company that handles your financial business 
 i 'd like to say something like this is how identity theft happens ... '' but it really is n't 
 nobody <unk> up and thinks it 's a good idea to send their account numbers and everything from their sin to their parent 's names as proof of id on the same page to six different companies 
 now why on earth did you make six copies of the exact same void <unk> '' and then it hits me 
 oh 
 & gt new suit : well i need to send it to six places i have this post it with the fax <unk> for each '' 
 & gt bytewave : you know what we 're now miraculously enough talking about something that falls under my job description '' 
 & gt new suit : oh 
 so you can help me with this '' 
 & gt bytewave : sort of 
 it falls under technical senior staff 's purview to ensure everyone who talks with customers about technical issues have the required grasp of the technologies involved at their level for the services we provide 
 usually it 's frontline techs - but still 
 i ca n't send your faxes but i have to ensure you get a class on the basics that you seem to <unk> need 
 a remarkable amount of complaints management gets are from people who ca n't operate their faxes and someone in your position needs to understand the technology as it 's almost always due to their equipment '' 
 & gt new suit : oh thanks but i really do n't care about that stuff i just need these six faxes sent 
 thank you i 'll wait for the secretaries tomorrow '' 
 & gt bytewave : i 'm afraid it 's not exactly <unk> in a case like this 
 i can get someone to sit with you to cover the basics you 'll need in your job discreetly - or i can file a coaching report that the director will have to review later 
 it 's much easier for everyone if <unk> eager to learn 
 sorry just my job you 'll understand ... '' & gt new suit : ... oh well i guess it 's true i do n't know much about this stuff 
 so what we head to the training rooms '' 
 & gt bytewave : no i have stuff to do 
 i 'll have someone from our team with you we should be able to do this by six '' 
 ... and so a little later a tired suit sits in class learning why you do n't need to use six void cheques if you want to fax the same one six times ... & gt most junior guy on senior staff : ... and so the first <unk> of the technology that closest <unk> what we use today came with with <unk> <unk> in <unk> ... ... & gt ... and therefore only a single copy of input contents is required as it is then converted into a <unk> and <unk> through phone lines as <unk> tones ... as a copy multiple inputs of the same document are of course unnecessary ... he told me the next day the newest manager listened but looked like someone who had been <unk> to hard labor and was counting his minutes to freedom 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 firstly thanks to <unk> for prompting me to write this after seeing my flair 
 now i hope this fits in this sub ... so i’m not really in tech support but i think this <unk> as at the time i was managing the development and roll out of a new piece of software sort of a halfway house between customer and dev 
 - quite <unk> actually 
 if you are in the uk then you may have seen the <unk> on tv and in the press about <unk> auto <unk> 
 for those who don’t know basically if you earn above a threshold your employer must put you in a pension scheme and must <unk> to your pension 
 simple concept yes 
 yes it is but the actual rules behind it are <unk> complicated 
 the developers guide is over 200 pages long and increasing 
 here for more info if you have a week to kill anyway in the uk the tax year ends on the 5th of april and starts on the 6th of april at which point the <unk> for auto <unk> change 
 depending on your assessment date depends on which threshold you use 
 so if you are paid monthly 1st to <unk> of april your assessment date is the beginning of the month 1st of april so you use last year’s figures unless you turn 22 in the month and your birthday is on the 6th or after in which case you use this year’s figures 
 there is much much more to it that this however… 
 with me 
 or bored yet 
 i’ll carry on anyway 
 a customer g phoned last april your <unk> is cl & gt g the system has used the wrong figures & gt cl ok let’s talk through the scenario 
 i then spend a good 20 minutes taking down key dates salary age information etc. and doing the <unk> manually & gt cl no it’s right because you assess on the 1st of april it has used the correct figures & gt g but today is the <unk> of april & gt cl yes it is & gt g so we need to use the new figures & gt cl no use the figures on the assessment date & gt g put i pay them at the end of the month & gt cl that’s fine but the assessment date is the 1st <unk> 
 in last year & gt g i don’t care i want to use this year’s figures & gt cl you can’t & gt g i want to because then i don’t have to put them in a pension at this point alarm bells ring they want to fudge it to avoid paying employer <unk> 1 % of salary i <unk> to add there followed an extensive call with me <unk> i wouldn’t change it in which i <unk> the phrase <unk> i will not change it to make it <unk> 
 they complained all the way up to director who all backed me which was nice and fudged it anyway **edit** so yes they told me they were going to fudge it anyway and if i had any faith that the <unk> would get round to looking at it yes i would report them - they will be <unk> shortly so it will come up <unk> is <unk> not <unk> **edit 2** everyone saying report him - it 's a her : previous walking over to the pc that was the focus of everyone 's attention 
 what secrets do you hide i wondered 
 i grabbed a new coffee and connected up the computer to a screen 
 colourblind finally looked up from his chair 
 & gt colourblind : what do you… 
 think is on there 
 colourblind’s curiosity hadn’t died 
 good 
 & gt me : er i don’t think i even want to know 
 & gt colourblind : what if it’s good 
 his eyes had lost their sad edge they now shone with dreams of the possibilities 
 i got up from my desk to get a hard drive with the company images on it 
 as i came back to the spot where the computer lay i noticed that had been turned on 
 colourblind looked <unk> up at me 
 & gt colourblind : sorry 
 i couldn’t help it 
 but look… 
 <unk> boot device <unk> & gt me : what the… 
 & gt colourblind : lets look in the bios 
 in the bios we stared at the screen which told us no hard drives were plugged in 
 & gt me : maybe the board died on the hard drive 
 i grabbed the screwdrivers from a nearby desk and cracked open the computer 
 & gt colourblind : airz 
 did you pull this thing apart before 
 & gt me : nope 
 i looked at the empty drive <unk> 
 no hard drives 
 & gt colourblind : how did 
 & gt me : er… 
 i looked frantically around the office 
 how did a computer work upstairs then only 15 minutes later not have a hard drive 
 & gt colourblind : f* # $ & gt me : yep 
 next so this is a story my boss told me yesterday 
 he went to a client who was having wireless internet connectivity issues 
 he checked out all three of their computers they were all connected wirelessly but the connection was a bit <unk> 
 after a while he figured out that all the computers in the office were connected to the internet via the printer 
 it 's one of those printers that lets you connect to it so you can print from a device without having to go through the router or anything 
 so apparently this printer was <unk> up as an access point for the network 
 everyone went through that to get to the router 
 of course none of the users realised that 's what the problem was 
 once the printer 's wireless details were removed from every machine and they were all connected to the router again which strangely had a far weaker signal than the printer everything returned to normal 
 and i imagine the little men inside the printer that make the miracles happen stopped having frequent panic <unk> is a little more recent than my previous posts : back in the <unk> 's we had a <unk> machine that was never supposed to fail and really did n't with 8 <unk> 
 everyone in the machine room seemed to have an <unk> <unk> 
 whenever anyone got close to the machine a message was printed on the system <unk> machine yeah <unk> baud 
 the message said something like * '' processor 5 failed '' * followed by a time stamp 
 since this system was redundant as all get out the only thing that anyone not in the machine room noticed was slightly increased latency in responses 
 when the area around the machine was vacated another message was printed : * '' processor 5 is operating '' * again with a time stamp 
 this was a really new installation less than a month since startup so we called the manufacturer 's tech support 
 the support tech immediately replaced the processor 5 boards as we expected he would but nothing changed 
 out of curiosity all of the <unk> techs were standing around watching 
 processor 5 would resume operation only when everybody left the immediate vicinity of the machine 
 after several hours of diagnostics which passed when no on was close to the machine but failed otherwise complete with snide comments from the audience about <unk> action at a <unk> the support tech found a slightly bent pin on one of processor 5 's sockets 
 he powered down processor 5 straightened the pin restored power and restarted processor 5. it worked even with the audience standing right next to the machine 
 this was a mainframe type installation on a raised floor 
 the raised floor had not been installed properly 
 the weight of any individual standing near the machine was enough to <unk> the floor causing the connection to fail followed immediately by the error message 
 shortly afterwards we got a new assembly for processor 5 under <unk> 
 i was n't there at the time so i do n't know how much was replaced but we never had that <unk> <unk> effect on the machine again 
 as far as i know the floor was never <unk> - we just lived with <unk> was the query we just got from a client who just got their ssl cert renewal invoice 
 i pulled up her invoice from last year and the email comms between her and our sales guy 
 we are adding your ssl <unk> to your final invoice 
 please note that this is an annual charge 
 it needs to be renewed before july <unk> 2015 '' it was clearly labelled as an annual fee on her invoice as well 
 so i asked her in spite of this why she thought her ssl cert should be permanent 
 & gt <unk> do n't expire '' 
 excuse me 
 & gt i have had my degree since 2004 imagine if i had to pay for that to be renewed every year or i could not practice marketing 
 it is permanent '' 
 we explained that this is a normal practice and that every single ssl cert provider will bill the same way 
 she accused us of taking advantage of people who do not understand tech and has now shut down her account with us 
 flabbergasted to be honest 
 or : how the <unk> saved his boss butt it 's the early 21st century and one of my first jobs as freelance it & amp media guy '' is with a local pr company 
 mostly working on their first website yay future 
 and fixing various user problems 
 really basic stuff but i was a newbie in many areas making stuff up as i went along so it fit 
 in late summer the cto of a japanese tech company was in germany to <unk> an <unk> show and meet a couple of <unk> 
 our company had been working to become the official pr agency for the japanese tech company for europe and they got the cto to meet with our boss and project leads here before the show 
 the cto was carrying a laptop that had all the important files for the presentations on it 
 i was told the laptop simply went black in the middle of the meeting and would n't come back on for a while 
 when it finally did boot again there was a boot error and the cto declared the laptop was broken and the data gone for good 
 my boss sent for me to have me take a look at the machine 
 i saw the error message <unk> broken and said that i might be able to get the data 
 & gt should n't be that hard i just use one of them linux <unk> to boot the machine and copy the files to one of our laptops over the lan and that was when the translator said & gt are you mad 
 the cto of a high tech company has just declared the machine beyond repair 
 do you have any idea how much it will offend him if some lowly german computer nerd can prove him wrong that easily 
 & gt so would you rather not holding your presentation than being helped 
 who 's the mad guy here 
 & gt i 'll think of something now please leave us 
 you 're not needed here 
 my boss nodded and i went back into the makeshift it office thinking to myself how <unk> that just had been 
 10 minutes later the translator entered my office laptop under his arm 
 he told me my boss would be taking the cto out to lunch now and that he the translator had convinced the cto that those new laptops might have a sort of internal backup system that could be accessed in case of emergency 
 & gt i basically dropped a couple of buzz words and he had to agree unless he wanted to admit that he does n't have a clue 
 i was sent here to give you instructions but i guess you know what to do better than me '' 
 we both grinned 
 he continued : & gt now this is important : it must look like it was a really difficult job 
 it must look very ... technological 
 wires tools hardware parts etc 
 oh and take apart the laptop 
 can you do that 
 i nodded and he excused himself to join out bosses at lunch 
 booting the machine using a linux <unk> worked like a charm finding and copying the files was child 's play 
 so while the data was being copied over the network to another laptop a co-worker and i started <unk> '' the office 
 we removed the side panels from the desktop pcs put a bunch of cables here and there got the tool boxes and <unk> hardware parts out of the closet and put them onto a <unk> put the networking stuff into a place where one could easier see all those pretty leds etc 
 and for a final touch we put a soldering iron onto the desk right next to the cto 's laptop 
 it was horrible and beautiful at the same time 
 2 hours later our boss and the japanese guests came back from their meal and the translator came by to ask if everything went ok. it did 
 he then ushered his boss into the room 
 the cto scanned the room then saw the remains of his laptop spread across the workbench with the soldering iron next to it 
 he turned to his translator and they exchanged some words 
 the translator then told me : & gt please hand him the new laptop 
 do n't say anything just nod a bit 
 i did as instructed 
 the cto opened it up the presentation was already waiting to be started 
 there was not a single muscle moving in his face 
 he close the laptop nodded towards his translator not me and then left the room to get back to talking business with my boss and the project leads 
 later i was told that during lunch the cto had phones his company and ordered a <unk> to fly to germany asap to bring a new laptop with the presentation data etc 
 keep in mind this is early 2000 and we are talking huge amounts for that time of data <unk> videos etc 
 so just ftp that stuff overnight '' was not an option 
 said <unk> would not make it in time for the presentation the next day 
 our company would later get to do some business for the japanese company so mission <unk> '' i guess 
 a few weeks later we got a package from <unk> in it mostly pr stuff for the marketing guys to play around with etc 
 but also a small box labeled for it '' 
 in it was a soldering station and a card that read & gt we noticed you have a very old soldering iron 
 we gift this new japanese one to you so you may fix computers more efficiently in the future me : this is <unk> user : i moved my monitor and now nothing works me : alright 
 is your monitor on 
 user : no 
 me : is your computer on 
 user : no 
 me : ... is your power strip on 
 user : how do i tell 
 me : is the light on it on 
 user : no 
 me : is it plugged in 
 user : umm 
 where does it plug into 
 me : the wall is usually a good place for that 
 user : uh 
 okay i got it 
 i had just plugged it into an open spot on itself 
 me : alright 
 well let 's turn that computer on then 
 user : it says start windows normally '' 
 me : alright hit yes 
 user : yes 
 me : sorry 
 use your keyboard 
 hit enter 
 on your keyboard 
 user : it 's working 
 me : sweet 
 let me know if you have any more problems 
 -- end call -- tl dr such power many work compute wow how does strip there are some things in life you just can’t train for 
 cooling is a very delicate thing 
 managing heat can be difficult at the best of times but when your datacentre is in an office building shit can hit the fan quickly and when that happens you just have to <unk> 
 it was the middle of summer - 40 degree days <unk> <unk> heat high <unk> 
 we had two airconditioning units for the datacentre a big one and a small one that was about half the size 
 i referred to this as <unk> as the big one was new and the small one was old and thus most likely to fail 
 we’d always planned to get a third one the same size as the big one 
 the designs were drawn up and it was quoted on but cash flow at a startup is light so we <unk> on the big one and hoped for the best 
 & gt /u/wizbam : *this summer .. hope was not enough 
 * the environmental sensors went off not long after the <unk> management console stopping responding to pings 
 i ran to the plant room with that hope in my heart but that hope was quickly pissed away as i nearly <unk> in fear 
 the room was quiet 
 <unk> was dead its corpse smelt like burning 
 the air temperature in the dc went from 24 to 26 in five minutes 
 with that rate of change it would be over 40 degrees within the hour 
 we had about an hour and a half before the servers would reach shutdown temperature and probably two hours max before the switches and routers shut off 
 we’d be screwed if it got that far but our customers would be worse if their drives melted down 
 if that wasn’t bad enough when the <unk> blew it took out a whole bunch of circuits with it 
 <unk> all of the additional power outlets around the room 
 /u/haakon666 and i gathered in a <unk> to decide the plan of attack and after five minutes of discussion orders were issued 
 <unk> minutes to shutdown temperature 
 we sent every non-critical staff member to <unk> in every direction with $ 100 and one instruction : buy as many fans as you can carry 
 i ran off to a hardware store to buy as many <unk> extension leads and power boards as i could and left /u/haakon666 to shut down all non-critical servers while the other two techs called as many of our customers as they could to let them know the situation and strongly advise they shut down anything non-critical also 
 the ceo called the ceo of our airconditioning company and pulled the trigger on a purchase order that said <unk> doesn’t matter what it costs come in and build right <unk> 
 their office was an hour away and the portable <unk> they were bringing took half an hour to <unk> as they were in pieces 
 75 minutes to shutdown temperature 
 our <unk> <unk> all returned about the same time 
 /u/haakon666 and i ran in different directions with <unk> power cables and proceeded to barge into every office we could find and steal their power 
 the people who questioned us were glared at and <unk> told it was an emergency followed shortly by us storming off and looking for the next outlet 
 with the power cabling complete phase 2 was about to begin 
 i don’t know how many fans there were 
 there would have been about 10 people on the fan mission so … a lot 
 we broke the power cables out into power boards plugged in fans and opened both the doors <unk> air down the aisles and along the row to the <unk> 
 a wall of heat <unk> out into the hall 
 it felt like getting hit in the face 
 it was <unk> degrees now 
 we didn’t have much time 
 the building airconditioning in the office and the hall were doing little to stem the flow of hot air and the lobby began to heat up 
 we opened the doors to our office to every other office and when they started to heat up too the fire escape 
 unfortunately this did little to stem the flow 
 the hot air that the one remaining ac was sucking back in was getting hotter and in turn it became less and less effective 
 /u/haakon666 and i dedicated what little time we had remaining to helping the larger customers determine what they could safely shut off and unplug anything redundant 
 the heat was <unk> <unk> 
 we took turns in the room as long as we could stand it before <unk> out and taking a rest to <unk> 
 i thought i was going to throw up 
 he looked somehow pale and overheated at the same time 
 55 degrees 
 the servers would be reaching failure temperature soon but there was nothing more we could do we sat and watched the fans spin <unk> 
 all we had left was the waiting game and the waiting game sucks 
 at that moment four airconditioning techs ran through the open doors each pushing a <unk> portable <unk> 
 i’d never been so happy to see anyone in my life 
 they plugged into the waiting power outlets and with a <unk> they sprung to life 
 heat exhaust <unk> two feet wide <unk> their way down the aisles and out the door 
 and for the first time in what seemed like forever the temperature began to drop 
 we were saved but this was a temporary measure the units had buckets in them that needed to be emptied frequently so we took turns emptying them down the sink 
 the other ac team had gotten to work shifting our new <unk> unit in and they were all hands on deck for as long as they had to be to get it online 
 the temperature had dropped to a <unk> but totally <unk> 28 degrees 
 no hard drives crashed 
 only two servers hit thermal max and they shut down gracefully in response 
 i went home early that day 
 <unk> exhausted and 100 % out of fucks i was no longer of use to anyone 
 someone asked why i was leaving 
 all i could manage was one word 
 “no” 
 <unk> be <unk> promised something nice for <unk> so here it is : & amp nbsp i work for a small it company that manages big law firms and car <unk> 
 we still cater to our older home users not wanting to toss them away now that we 've gotten a bit larger 
 & amp nbsp one of these people are very old 80 's to 90 's and he usually <unk> about without any issue 
 when he calls us it 's like a train hitting a wall going 90 <unk> 
 for instance one time he called and screamed at me as i could not escalate his call - it was very busy and he wanted to <unk> us about cryptowall as seen on the sunday <unk> 
 yes we know about that we were dealing with two <unk> of <unk> as he called funny enough 
 but that 's not the point here ... & amp nbsp the point here is that this man always tries to be helpful but has absolutely no idea what he is doing 
 but at his age and still being able to function on his own with his computer 
 sounds good to me 
 & amp nbsp one day he calls us as he is having an issue with <unk> 
 something happened and then he found he could n't use his mouse 
 he sets down the phone and <unk> under the desk and then you can hear him audibly groan from a distance before he comes back and tells us that he 's unplugged everything by accident 
 & amp nbsp so this requires an on-site visit 
 they 're expensive but he does n't seem to mind 
 and it is way better than him being on the floor at his age 
 we get an appointment set up for him but i 'm told by hr that the day chosen was actually his birthday 
 & amp nbsp fast forward to that day and i 've bought the <unk> card i could find and had everyone in the office sign it 
 i sent my tech on his way and it went like this : & amp nbsp & gt tech hands $ user the bill for that day 's appointment as he was n't able to <unk> the agreement 
 & gt $ user signs bill 
 & gt tech takes bill back and smiles and then pulls the card out from wherever he was hiding it 
 & gt $ user takes the card <unk> hugs my tech and then calls us in the office 
 & amp nbsp this user is as stated old 
 he repeated a few times about how happy he was and about how all of his friends were dead along with his family and that no one would have known it was his birthday 
 he cried to me on the phone shouted a big thank you to all of the techs that i had listening in and then offered to beat up any older clients if they ever gave us any lip 
 & amp nbsp it was undoubtedly the most adorable thing i 've ever had happen at work 
 & amp nbsp *on a side note he called us the next day to tell us the speakers were n't plugged in 
 as a courtesy we went back free of charge only to find he had n't turned on his speakers despite clearly laughing and scoffing at the idea and saying what do you think i 'm an idiot 
 of course they 're on 
 he felt silly but we still love him anyway 
 * **edit : thank you all for helping me get this formatted correctly 
 u **i work for health insurance company on the east coast and have been part of the tech <unk> group for going on 7 years now and this is my first are you <unk> me '' tech support moment that i felt like posting ... this story takes place on a warm sunny saturday morning we were working all week on upgrading the vpn software on the new wave of laptops we just got 
 my boss we will call him barney as to protect his real name just <unk> any of my fellow people find me on reddit gave us a list of things to troubleshoot while setting up said computers 
 well barney was in a meeting with the ceo and a bunch of the other directors and they all wanted the first wave of new laptops 
 all of them were setup and working for each user as of friday afternoon when i left at noon 
 they were going to be picking them up before they left for the day ... <unk> so i thought saturday morning roles around and i am woken up to the sound of my phone going off at 6am 
 after answering the phone it was barney <unk> 
 i tried to calm him down to find out what was wrong but barney was in full panic mode freaking out and sounding like he was going to have a heart attack 
 i talked to him for about 10 minutes until i figured out the issue ... .and it was a big one ... the new laptops were not working at all the <unk> wouldnt let them log in and the directors had no idea why 
 so i called our ceo i didnt volunteer i was basically told to because barney was having a break down 
 after speaking to our ceo i will call him hermin hermin was no help at all after almost 20 minutes of trying to ask him what the problem was 
 he just kept repeating it wont connect i am really disappointed '' 
 i tried to walk him through the setup and he keeps saying that the computer is asking for a windows key ... so right there i know something isnt right 
 then hermin just begins getting really mad and then he slips out the words god dammit obama '' ... <unk> i am holding back my laughter with all of my strength and tell him i will make my way to the office 
 ok so now at this point i drive into the office which is 45 minutes away 
 so i dont even get dressed just jump in the car and drive off to the office 
 when i get there i finally get to the 5th floor and find my way to my work area and then i see it ... the 6 laptops sitting on the tech cart with a giant sign that says directors laptops '' and each was boxed with the different directors name on a label on both sides and top of the box so it was easy to read ... <unk> didnt take the correct laptops ... <unk> when it gets good ... .i then have to call hermin back and explain to him what the problem is 
 that basically whoever grabbed the laptops gave them the wrong ones 
 i say im sorry for this <unk> and tell them that they have to switch them out 
 the ones they have arent even setup with windows yet hence the windows key screen ... 
 hermin then begins to get really mad at me and below i have laid out the <unk> for you : hermin : well i am the one that grabbed these so you are saying i took the wrong ones 
 how am i suppose to know which ones are the right ones '' 
 me : where did you take them from 
 we had them on the tech cart in the support area with a sign on them 
 they had each directors name on the box because we set them up based on how you wanted them '' hermin : this is ridiculous where was that cart 
 i dont know where the tech support area is '' 
 me : but you said you grabbed the laptops your self so where did you take them from '' 
 hermin : dont get smart with me '' 
 me : sir i am only trying to figure out how to correct this mistake please dont think i am insulting you in anyway 
 i just want to know which ones you took '' hermin : well we are all without working computers now this is entirely your fault '' me : barney is in charge of this project not me so please talk to him regarding this '' hermin : you need to bring us these laptop asap 
 otherwise the directors will be unable to answer emails or contact clients '' <unk> is false as each one has a work phone which has access to their <unk> me : ok where are you 
 do you want to come into the office so i can give you the correct laptops and show you how to connect to the network '' 
 hermin : we are in atlantic city '' me : thats a 7 hour drive for me ... '' hermin : start <unk> '' *click* at this point i call barney back and flip out i am not driving 7 hours to give <unk> laptops because our ceo is a moron 
 barney is begging me to do it and i tell him that this is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard 
 after screaming at barney for another 30 minutes i hear my phone ringing its hermin 
 hermin : are you going to drive them to us '' 
 me : are you joking sir 
 i understand you need the laptops but thats 7 hours of driving all because you took the wrong ones 
 this is ridiculous of you to demand this and i just cant do that '' hermin : so you arent going to do this then 
 we need them 
 if you dont do this on monday we will have a meeting about this with all of the directors '' 
 me : that is fine with me i will explain to them what i explained to you '' hermin : see you monday and if they all agree with me we will be letting you go that after noon '' *click* monday rolls around and at this point im ready to lose my job because our ceo is a fool 
 my manager barney is really upset and freaking out as we walk into the conference room 
 all of the directors and the ceo are in the room and hermin is at the head of the table ready to yell 
 we sit down and he starts saying that this situation could have been avoided 
 after listening to the garbage roll out of his mouth i stand up and say the following : me : ok let me start off by saying that we took an entire week to do this last minute upgrade for you 
 we spent many hours setting up your laptops and upgrading your vpn systems with the help of the networking team 
 with that said i would like to say sorry but not for myself but for our ceo '' 
 hermin : what did you say '' 
 me : since you are so hell bent on firing me i would atleast like to explain this situation to everyone in the room so please allow me to do that '' hermin : ok fine '' 
 me : we setup your 6 specific laptops and <unk> checked that they all worked before we were ready to give them to you 
 we also put them on a cart in our area with a bright yellow sigh that said these were your laptops as well as <unk> each one of them based on the user 
 then we left them in the middle of the room so they would be easy to find 
 i got called at 6am because someone grabbed the wrong laptops 
 this is not my fault then i was blamed for this and told to drive to atlantic city where the conference was that you all attended to give you the <unk> which to me is unacceptable 
 you do not pay me enough to drive that far out of my way because of someone else screw up '' 
 at this point hermin 's face is turning bright red with anger but he holds back until i finish 
 me : '' i have pictures of the tech support area that day as well as access to the cameras for that floor 
 after further review it shows hermin going into the tech support closet and taking out fresh unopened laptops which didnt even have an os on them he told me on the phone he didnt know where the tech support area was but the camera 's show him walking right past the main room to our closet 
 he then threatened to fire me over his own ignorance '' 
 hermin : how dare you '' 
 just as i was getting ready to be thrown out of the building one of the other directors stands up and says this is not your fault this is <unk> '' ... like the voice of an <unk> ... hermin : these pictures have to be false there is no way i missed them '' me : you did and i also have you on our call system saying you had no idea where the tech support area is if you like i can play that back for you '' director 1 : its fine this is clearly not your issue and we will let it go 
 sorry about the confusion '' 
 me : thank you for understanding but just so you are all aware this ill be going to hr before the end of the day '' hermin : how dare you '' i walked out of the room sent an email to hr and had a meeting that day 
 by the end of that week i had a formal apology letter form the ceo as well as the directors all of which saying that i did an excellent job 
 point of the story : stupid ceo took wrong laptops blamed me blamed obama and wanted me to drive to atlantic city with 6 laptops 
 edit : sorry everyone for the really terrible typing i sent this from my phone so there is a lot of fail in <unk> the story is still there 
 i am entirely way to lazy to go back and edit this to sound like an adult typed this rather then a <unk> but ... <unk> is a hell of a drug previous <unk> redcheery and i finally got her wound cleaned up and started packing away the equipment 
 & gt angryf : oh for f* % $ <unk> sake 
 the shout rang out over the entire office 
 everyone stopped working i wondered <unk> then i realized he’d sworn 
 loudly 
 & gt redcheer : huh looks like our famous designer is having trouble 
 & gt me : famous 
 i went back to packing away the equipment everyone else was still frozen 
 & gt angryf : tech - man 
 get over here 
 it took a kick from redcheery to get me to pay attention i normally don’t respond to <unk> <unk> 
 i walked over to the angry man he was in a rage over his computer 
 & gt angryf : its not f* % $ ing <unk> the red headed lady had followed me over and cut angryfamous off in the middle of the sentence 
 & gt redcheer : swearing 
 especially at people that are trying to help will not make your computer work 
 & gt angryf : well its not doing what i need it to do 
 i looked down at the machine it had completely frozen 
 & gt me : mmmm looks like we’ll have to try a restart 
 & gt angryf : wont work this f* $ … 
 the red headed lady gave angryfamous a sharp look 
 he corrected 
 & gt angryf : i mean this… bad computer has stalled like three times today 
 & gt redcheer : oh doesn’t matter 
 its got a red sticker 
 that means it’s one of the ones that’s about to be replaced with those new ones 
 the red cheery lady pointed over to the new machines that had just been upgraded with water pumps 
 & gt angryf : oh sweet lets go get one 
 as a group we made our way over to the desktops all lined up on a random desk 
 angryfamous picked up one of the machines 
 & gt redcheer : no not that one 
 that’s my one 
 & gt angryf : i like this one and i’m pretty busy i need to get back to work 
 angry famous started walking back to his desk with the computer 
 & gt redcheer : but i’ve bonded with that one 
 i’ve bleed into it 
 & gt angryf : i don’t care 
 tech-man come help me plug everything in 
 it was at this point i realized famous hadn’t even bothered asking my name 
 i wasn’t keen on him 
 i looked over at my red haired helper she did seem genuinely upset about losing her bonded pc 
 & gt me : don’t worry redcheer it’s just a computer 
 & gt redcheer : but… i bleed into that one 
 we had a bond 
 & gt me : well it was only a little bit of <unk> <unk> the crashing sound was of a brand new computer being dead dropped from a standing position 
 & gt angryf : awww yuck it **actually** has blood inside it 
 & gt me : well no 
 it’s been <unk> 
 we do n't just leave blood in a computer 
 & gt angryf : oh… angry didn’t seem to know what to say after that 
 he walked over to the desk of pc’s and looked at the others 
 i walked over to the pc on the ground 
 no visible damage 
 i picked it up off the floor 
 & gt me : okay lets go get this setup for you 
 & gt angryf : no… i don’t think i like that one anymore 
 & gt me : why not 
 & gt angryf : i don’t really want a dropped one 
 just… the worst kind of person 
 next an old story from my frontline days 
 i was still really new maybe two months in 
 & gt bytewave : welcome to technical support my name is bytewave how may i help you '' 
 customer introduces himself and i make the id 
 very polite older gentleman with what i recognize as a south african accent 
 & gt mr. opoku : i 'm sorry to trouble you this used to be so fast but the internet is slow now ... quite slow 
 is there a problem these last few weeks '' 
 i 'm already running <unk> no loss <unk> pings pretty clear his connection is fine 
 speed test just to be sure ... & gt bytewave : please open your browser we 'll go run a speed test to make sure there 's no issue on our end '' 
 he agrees and there 's a long silence 
 & gt bytewave : okay in the address bar i need you to type www ... & gt mr. opoku : <unk> but there 's no address bar yet 
 it 's ... slow now 
 used to be fast 
 it will take longer for this to open '' 
 i chuckle on mute 
 normally support ends pretty much here but he 's nice 
 it 's his first call to us ever 
 and his account dates to the days canada was <unk> south african refugees at the height of <unk> 
 i feel like keeping going a little bit 
 & gt bytewave : do you know which version of windows you 're running '' 
 & gt mr. opoku : <unk> ... windows me '' 
 this may be the only call i remember where the user ran <unk> while his problem had nothing to do with the os 
 i err a guess ... & gt bytewave : double click on my computer tell me how many drives you see '' 
 yep ... takes awhile for that to open too 
 & gt mr. opoku : <unk> local disk and cd-rom '' 
 & gt bytewave : local disk 
 right click it properties tell me the size limit and how much is used '' 
 i swear we had to wait for the context menu to show up at all 
 & gt mr. opoku : <unk> megabytes ... '' & gt bytewave : that 's your size limit '' 
 & gt mr. opoku : <unk> but also the used space i believe '' 
 & gt bytewave : ... sir your hard disk is simply full which is causing your entire computer to function very slowly 
 it 's not a problem on our end 
 should have a friend help you free up some space and your computer will be fast again '' 
 & gt mr. opoku : is there ... any way you could suggest to me how to do it <unk> 
 do n't have many friends here ... '' & gt bytewave : we 're not supposed to help with issues unrelated to our service please understand if you call again with similar issues the agent will not help you but ... lets try emptying your recycle bin in case there 's something there '' 
 & gt mr. opoku : there 's a slow progress bar ... very slow ... oh 
 this is fast now 
 you fixed it 
 the internet works '' 
 he sounds so genuinely happy like i magically repaired his <unk> internet 
 still being a newbie was kinda happy for a little win 
 & gt mr. opoku : there 's ... quite a bit of space left now 
 why was my recycle bin taking so much space on the drive '' 
 ... i quickly explain there were deleted files that had not been <unk> form the disk and he thanks me profusely 
 end of call 
 three days later my manager wants to talk to me and mentions the customer by name 
 yeah obviously i 'm about to get an earful about the support limit ... but as i walk in his office he hands me a brown envelope ... <unk> with beautiful <unk> on <unk> paper my first customer appreciation letter with all sorts of praise you could see it meant a lot to him 
 delivered in a 8 1/4 by 11 sized envelope so it would n't be folded 
 there was also money in the envelope which we 'd have to return 
 my boss asked me if i wanted it 'on the billboard but i said no - we 're not putting pins in this 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 today i discovered that in my companies upstairs department there is one individual who arrives early and turns all of the computers on and logs them in 
 she keeps everyone 's passwords on a piece of paper in her draw 
 i found this out as the individual in question was away 
 turns out that nobody knows their own password ... ugh 
 edit : i thankfully do not work in it so this whole shitstorm is not going to backfire on me 
 the biggest problem would be that we have one it person for the entire company and if you ca n't find him <unk> tough 
 hello techies of all <unk> 
 just a short one that happened today that i just wanted to facepalm so hard at 
 so <unk> a walks briefly in to our office today and this is what goes down user a : hey guys so i left my laptop at home today and i ca n't seem to get my pc to start as i was going to use that instead '' fairly normal question but unusual that the user has both a laptop and pc in our place 
 colleague : so when was the last time you used your pc '' 
 user a : about a year ago '' so in my mind i 'm thinking it 's a password sync issue and a easy fix 
 so i get up and walk to user a 's desk and she points to the monitor and says : so i try to switch the monitor on but nothing is turning on '' 
 well shit 
 all i can see on the table is a docking station that 's linked up to the monitor 
 i proceeded to refrain from calling her an idiot and advised her she 'll have to work from home or collect her laptop 
 this reddit is my job 
 and most likely yours edit : <unk> is dave 's story 
 name has been changed to protect the ignorant it was a quiet thursday afternoon at the support desk 
 i was in the middle of <unk> my action figures when the phone rang 
 it 's not printing '' said the voice on the other end 
 i 'm sorry '' 
 i replied as i glanced at the caller id 
 it was the dave the company 's director of purchasing 
 my printer 
 it 's not printing '' 
 okay '' i say 
 i 'll be up as soon as i finish what i 'm doing 
 for right now just use the shared printer in the bull pen '' 
 no 
 i ca n't do that 
 i need you to fix it now '' 
 click 
 he hung up on me 
 it 's not my favorite way to end a conversation but it happens often enough that it does n't <unk> me 
 i finish <unk> my action figures and make my way upstairs 
 i must have surprised dave 
 he still had his facebook games on his screen 
 he opened an empty spreadsheet and turned to watch me 
 i go through the basic steps 
 cables are secure 
 link light is on 
 the display reads tray 2 empty '' 
 everything is normal 
 wait 
 tray 2 empty '' 
 did he really just call me because he was out of paper 
 i opened the paper tray 
 i looked at dave 
 dave looked at the paper tray 
 dave looked at me 
 i looked at the paper tray 
 dave looked at the paper tray 
 i looked at dave 
 dave looked at the floor 
 i walk across the hall to the supply closet and get a ream of paper 
 i cross back over to his office and load the paper into his printer 
 it <unk> to life when i close the tray and i hand him his document 
 he was making a <unk> <unk> tale happens back in the mid 90s a time of joy sadness and dial-up isps 
 i worked for one and once <unk> that i could run someone through windows95 dial up networking setup with my eyes closed 
 my <unk> thought i was lying and proceeded to bet me $ 10 i could n't 
 i ca n't and i 've been here longer than you '' 
 he said 
 i know i can 
 in fact i 'll <unk> myself and do it 
 i will let you know when i 'm on one you can listen in '' 
 he agreed 
 the next morning i showed up with a <unk> to use as the blindfold 
 and as luck would have it my first call was a <unk> <unk> setup call for our service 
 on goes the blindfold and i lean back and walk the caller through the setup all the way from click on the start button '' to his first web page without a glitch 
 i did the <unk> and took off the blindfold 
 no fewer than a half dozen of my fellow techs were watching me do this blindfolded there was chatter on our irc channel about it and my <unk> looked <unk> as all fucking hell at losing the bet 
 he did pay up and i had a nice sandwich for lunch that day 
 tl dr : no really i can do that <unk> bit of backstory : & amp nbsp way back when i was one-man it for a family business 
 in the early days of the <unk> think <unk> dsl and cable when people still <unk> the merits of modems and <unk> <unk> modems were the bane of the existence of many i was tasked with getting us online 
 what to do 
 we had no network and i had no budget 
 cue <unk> <unk> strung about 'cause the equipment was available for cheap back then <unk> was becoming the <unk> but was still expensive and gigabit had just dropped and was <unk> expensive and <unk> much less switches plus stringing cat 5 would be way more costly than <unk> 
 & amp nbsp so now we were all wired up with <unk> to go 
 bless the powers they accepted my explanation as to why a ton of dial-up was not the answer 
 but what then 
 unfortunately the facility was hell and gone from *newdeathstarbabybell* 's nearest co so a t1 was right out of the question 
 <unk> back then were and may still be charged by distance for the physical circuit and access be it voice data etc was separate 
 the quoted loop charges were insane even if i could get access for cheap 
 but this <unk> service called isdn was not subject to a <unk> loop charge 
 for those unfamiliar isdn was sold in many places as 2 <unk> b <unk> channels for data and 1 <unk> d ata channel for <unk> 
 i figured 2 isdn lines or <unk> bandwidth should work 
 & amp nbsp sadly said <unk> 's internet offering was n't very advanced and could n't do <unk> 
 they charged by channel and connect time 
 so that was n't gon na fly 
 plus this was a bit of a <unk> area and <unk> was thin on the ground 
 i somehow managed to talk a local isp into leasing us a spanking new cisco 1720 with two isdn cards for cheap and rolling that into monthly dedicated bonded service 
 they were primarily a consumer dial-up isp first in town with 56k which is why they could also offer isdn and in the evenings <unk> definitely dropped but when we needed the bandwidth it was there 
 & amp nbsp for a year or so this was ok. but then flash started becoming a thing web pages were becoming more image <unk> and <unk> was growing popular 
 none were core business functions but what the powers want the powers get 
 and the powers wanted bandwidth 
 this was perfect timing $ isp was getting commercially shaky and the service grew <unk> <unk> 
 meanwhile *newdeathstarbabybell* had recently started offering frame relay dedicated access in our area significantly more cheaply 
 so out went one 1720 and in came another 
 this time we had to supply the router and i had to configure it 
 so i learned a little ios 
 this will become important later 
 but for now bandwidth was quadrupled our users <unk> and we carried on 
 & amp nbsp another year and a half down the road and the screaming begins <unk> over the slowness 
 by this time we 've got servers and printers and devices galore hung to hell and gone 
 so it is decided that we 'll do it right this time and the <unk> begins 
 but our contract with *newdeathstarbabybell* does n't run out for six months so while we can redo all the infrastructure and be ready to move we ca n't actually switch until then and we 'll have to have both running for about a month 
 they wanted <unk> <unk> so all was <unk> 
 & amp nbsp **at long last we get to the story : ** *yellowrunfastshortdistance* telco was mounting a big push in the area to gain customers and had been by to see about picking up our dedicated voice business about a month prior we did a metric <unk> of inbound <unk> 800 service 
 & amp nbsp i called the <unk> and said if we got a deal on a <unk> circuit i might be amenable to switching things up when our voice contract came up in about a year 
 she came back with a price that was equal to what *newdeathstarbabybell* would 've wanted for the t1 loops alone and threw in a shiny new cisco <unk> think it was a <unk> 
 to handle it all 
 they were going to handle provisioning install everything and the router was their problem 
 so they said 
 & amp nbsp problem : *yellowrunfastshortdistance* was n't very good at provisioning and had a bad working relationship with *newdeathstarbabybell* 
 i wish i 'd known that earlier 
 two weeks before the planned <unk> i still did n't have an install date for the circuits even though the router had already been installed and mounted and was merrily blinking away into the nothingness not connected to a damn thing 
 this will also be important later 
 & amp nbsp increasingly impatient calls to the network implementation team '' and my implementation specialist '' were met with platitudes and insistence that all was on track 
 the name of the implementation specialist 
 **i kid you not : think military term for a toilet with an a <unk> 
 ** from here on out she shall be military toilet 
 & amp nbsp so finally finally *newdeathstarbabybell* install tech shows up 
 i know these guys well i love these guys they love me 
 i frequently send them home with <unk> and have cellphone numbers for <unk> all 
 chubby sheriff c is the one that shows up today 
 & amp nbsp i call him that 'cause he kinda looks and sounds like a fat <unk> <unk> 
 c has a serious <unk> <unk> deep <unk> <unk> voice with a <unk> to match full <unk> beard and an <unk> <unk> moustache with no <unk> required 
 & amp nbsp & gt c : ok amigo i <unk> fur a t-span teh them <unk> 
 <unk> take them anyhow 
 & gt me : offer i could n't refuse you guys were $ $ $ $ more a month and they threw in the router 
 & gt c : <unk> 
 welp we <unk> pay fur all us <unk> techs like this prime <unk> <unk> right here <unk> his stomach which continues <unk> for a longer time than expected 
 & gt me : <unk> sheriff did you say <unk> t-span 
 & gt c : <unk> ... wun <unk> <unk> fresh 'n made <unk> order 
 & gt me : <unk> that 's supposed to be four there amigo 
 i ordered <unk> so if this ai n't it i 'm <unk> 
 & amp nbsp c calls in and <unk> the order is correct 
 i whip out my trusty <unk> <unk> and whistle up military toilet mt 
 & amp nbsp & gt mt : *yellowrunfastshortdistance* network <unk> this military toilet 
 & gt me : mt we have a serious problem 
 *newdeathstarbabybell* is here and they have an order for one circuit 
 not four one 
 & gt mt : <unk> jus calm down you know we been <unk> bout 'dis <unk> weeks 'n <unk> <unk> ordahs jus get put in <unk> wrong 
 imma check 
 & gt me : the 
 orders 
 get 
 put 
 in 
 wrong 
 are n't you the one that enters the order 
 & gt mt : aw <unk> we <unk> uh carrier <unk> <unk> <unk> team dat does dat 
 y'all in uh *newdeathstarbabybell* area 'n i <unk> n't put in dem ordahs 
 <unk> & gt mt : <unk> it <unk> jus one 
 imma call dem 
 <unk> 
 <unk> { ... calls so clear you can hear a pin drop ... } & gt me : muttered <unk> 
 & gt c : son looks like <unk> 's <unk> <unk> <unk> fur 
 & gt me : <unk> we have really big sharp <unk> around here how much do you like that beard 
 & gt c : laughing uh huh yer <unk> off fat ass and who 's <unk> 
 & gt mt : { ... and with our fast <unk> } <unk> i done <unk> <unk> 'n they say ya only need wun <unk> 
 & gt me : **what 
 ** a t1 line is <unk> megabits a second 
 the contract is for 6 megabits 
 & gt mt : <unk> dis is new we <unk> this <unk> called a smart jack 
 so it do it all wit one 
 & gt me : ... stunned silence ... & gt me : did i hear you correctly 
 a t1 can carry 96 channels of bandwidth because you use a <unk> <unk> 
 & gt c : doubles over laughing <unk> & gt mt : i don know <unk> 'bout no channels 'dis ai n't cable 
 & gt me : ... so no other orders exist 
 & gt mt : <unk> dat 's all ya need 
 & amp nbsp now the sales rep had brought her regional manager along for the call and he 'd given me his card 
 thankfully i remembered this right about now and rushed military toilet off the phone 
 as a rule i never give techs or fellow support people hell 
 sales people do not get this courtesy when things go wrong 
 sales people are frequently the source of things going wrong 
 called regional manager up and raised utter hell 
 & amp nbsp & gt rm : <unk> 
 & gt me : this is <unk> with redacted get me someone in engineering <unk> or whatever the **f & amp <unk> you people call it that knows what the **f & amp <unk> they 're doing because military toilet whom you assigned me and assured me was <unk> just tried to tell me a t1 can carry 6 <unk> 'cause it uses a are you ready for this smart jack 
 we only have one circuit being installed 
 & gt c : loses it and quite literally <unk> & gt rm : <unk> & amp nbsp so chubby sheriff <unk> from laughing at me installs our lone circuit and graciously <unk> the <unk> demarcation point where telco hands the circuit off to you to the network room 
 & amp nbsp to be continued if anyone actually reads this **tl dr : til <unk> make <unk> go to <unk> edit : formatting and second <unk> is now ** here just happened today when i was out for some emergency field work 
 it all started with one call from one of our beloved clients we call him $ drb 
 & gt ** $ me : ** hello techsupport you 're talking to $ <unk> '' 
 & gt ** $ drb : ** <unk> 
 $ drb here 
 i got problems with this damn f*cking pc again 
 i need someone to fix it as soon as possible 
 send someone here please '' 
 and yep he really started shouting in the middle of the sentence stopped and yelled again 
 he always does that 
 he is not that bad with it in general but sometimes especially when he gets really angry he does n't know how to close a task 
 & gt ** $ drb : ** if you wo n't send anyone i 'll toss every thing in here out of the window 
 i am sick of nothing working here as it should 
 i swear i will rip everything apart '' 
 he 's always like this so his screaming is easy to ignore 
 and he swears a lot more but otherwise it would n't be sfw 
 so after confirming that it was n't something simple as that the pc wo n't react even after restarting and unplugging it i get my toolbox ready and took off 
 gladly he <unk> just a few miles away so when i entered his office a few minutes later he seemed to have calmed down a bit 
 he showed me the pc and i looked at its backside 
 then i turned on the power switch 
 and it <unk> just fine and works perfectly normal 
 when i looked at $ drb he just shook his head and thanked me 
 & gt ** $ drb : ** and that was everything 
 just this '' 
 i nodded and he started laughing still shaking his head 
 once i returned i got mail from $ drb 
 & gt <unk> for fixing my problem 
 just one question : is it okay to shut the pc down or do you have to come again 
 * the time i needed to fix the problem : <unk> seconds 
 guess that 's a new personal <unk> opens ticket annoyed that her computer keeps getting automatically restarted while she want to work ... she says this is very limiting to her 
 <unk> allows you to <unk> updates until eventually it forces you to install them and restarts you computer in <unk> no cancel button apparently she complained about this in the past and someone showed her how she can limit the <unk> to times outside of her business hours 
 so she set updates to never install from <unk> ... only problem : she leaves at 5pm and turns off her pc ... every single day ... so <unk> no updates get installed and eventually the computer gets rebooted while shes working ... now shes complaining that the setting isnt working ... tl dr : user want the computer to install updates while its turned off 
 this happened sometime in <unk> the characters : don = me 
 $ mom = my mom 
 $ gfmom = my gf 's mom 
 $ gf = my gf at the time 
 it was a bright saturday morning 
 i was in the basement rag chewing with some of my friends on 75 meters when my mom called down the stairs : & gt $ mom : don $ gfmom is on the phone 
 she wants to talk to you '' <unk> 
 i can think of many reasons for $ gfmom to call me most of them bad 
 run up the stairs and take the phone 
 & gt don : hello '' & gt $ gfmom hi don '' & gt don : hi ... ... '' & gt $ gfmom my stove is talking and singing '' & gt don : what '' 
 & gt gfmom : my stove is talking and singing and $ gf said you might know what is going on '' whew 
 & gt don : what is it saying '' 
 & gt $ gfmom : i ca n't tell 
 i know its talking and singing but i ca n't make out what they are saying '' 
 & gt don : i 'll be over soon '' & gt $ gfmom to $ gf : $ gf why do n't you take the t-bird and pickup don '' 
 & gt $ gf to $ gfmom enthusiastically : sure '' 
 hangs up phone 
 i figured that this might be a technical issue so i grabbed my toolbox and went outside to wait for t-bird and $ gf 
 got to $ gf 's house and $ gfmom immediately leads me to the kitchen 
 & gt $ gfmom : it is only the right-rear burner and only for a few minutes after i first turn it on 
 then it stops and does n't happen again til i turn it off and it <unk> down '' 
 i turned right-rear burner on and sure enough it starts playing music 
 it was really distorted but what was coming out of the burner was obviously a commercial <unk> 
 it was a <unk> station 
 the audio faded out as the burner got hot so i turned it off to let it cool down 
 asked $ gf if she had an am radio which she did 
 turned it on and started at the low end of the <unk> band comparing each station with the sound from the stove 
 this was a slow process since we had to wait for the burner to cool every 2 minutes or so 
 <unk> did n't bother $ gf or me because $ gfmom left us <unk> kept <unk> till i got to <unk> am and we almost got blasted out of the kitchen by audio that was synchronized with the noise coming out of the stove 
 that signal was <unk> 
 called the station and the tech there said that they had recently <unk> their power from <unk> to <unk> 
 the <unk> towers were just across the <unk> from $ gf 's house 
 with that amount of power almost any slightly poor connection could act as a detector for am radio if it had any excuse for an antenna in this case the ac power line when the burner was switched on 
 after the burner cooled down i unplugged the stove and checked the connections to the right-rear burner 
 sure enough one of them was just a little loose 
 when it warmed up it <unk> up enough to stop the crystal set <unk> '' 
 one quarter turn of the loose screw and the talking and singing were silenced 
 when $ gfmom returned i demonstrated the silent stove 
 she was happy and insisted that i stay for a <unk> dinner 
 since she was an excellent italian cook that was an offer i could n't refuse 
 tl dr silenced a talking and singing stove 
 got to spend <unk> day with $ gf mostly alone 
 $ gfmom said <unk> '' 
 don ate a lot of great <unk> 
 after thought : i later heard that in $ gf 's neighborhood people had talking bathtub and sink <unk> <unk> light fixtures and singing furniture 
 i never did find out how they fixed those problems but i 'm sure that all of them were <unk> crystal sets '' just like the stove 
 editing : <unk> recently posted a few old tales about spam issues at my telco from the early <unk> when i was still working frontline 
 a huge spike in spam occurred because a single angry employee was able to steal a full list of every single email address we provided and sold it to <unk> 
 he just had to plug in a thumbdrive and accessed our billing database and copied everything easy as pie 
 in the wake of the crisis administrative rules came down demanding that unauthorized staff refrain from plugging in <unk> phones and such to company boxes 
 of course a security policy enforced by internal it would have been more effective than an administrative <unk> n't do it but let 's not go crazy 
 <unk> are the rule not the exception here 
 people did n't mind much it made sense and those with reasons to be <unk> were easily <unk> 
 people started charging their cellphones in power outlets instead of usb and everybody moved on 
 often literally 
 unionized employees in senior positions stick around for a long time but both frontline and lower level management have relatively high turnover rates 
 administrative rules gets twisted over time as their intent and the reasons why they were originally implemented are forgotten through the years as staff <unk> 
 many years later a new floor director started cracking down on <unk> cellphones at work at all* now calling it <unk> <unk> 
 the cost to charge cellphones is trivial and people regularly use their personal phones for purposes that ultimately benefit the company like tests so that looked like <unk> new grounds in the art of being insanely cheap 
 we 've since learned that this happened merely because the new director thought preventing electricity theft '' was the original intent behind the rule 
 at the time staff was more than a little unhappy to be told they were n't supposed to charge their phones at work over this misunderstanding though 
 the notion of electricity theft '' had some employees blowing a fuse and getting into heated arguments 
 someone who was quitting told hr and the union in a mandatory meeting that it was one of the reasons he felt <unk> as an employee and that the company no longer deserved his services - but that still did n't change anything 
 awhile later i was taking an escalation call from an employee trying to troubleshoot a caller id issue 
 all our business lines have confidential numbers so the usual way to test a customer 's caller id is to call them with a cellphone 
 i made a joke about it during a call that some people took more seriously than i intended 
 & gt frontline tech : so the customer 's caller id was n't working 
 like you asked i tried pushing the service profile to value added services server again so i guess now we just need to test it to see if it works '' 
 & gt bytewave - sarcastically : oh i see 
 this is a situation where you ca n't test our caller id fix because you 'd need to use your cellphone but your battery is dead and we ca n't do it with our business lines 
 we 'll have to tell the customer we ca n't test whether our solution worked because you 're not allowed to charge your phone here anymore as that would be 'electricity theft '' 
 the frontline tech knew i was kidding and laughed - his phone was fine - but several other escalation techs around my desk turned their heads towards me grinning 
 i already knew the fix was successful but i did n't realize my joke would get <unk> 
 the frontline tech was amused but may have been the only one to understand i was kidding 
 he used his phone for the test and confirmed all was well now 
 but fellow senior staff around me thought i was giving them a loud hint about how to push back against the 'electricity theft nonsense 
 they started using every excuse they could to <unk> on recorded lines that something could n't be done because there was no way to charge a phone 
 i was often working remotely at the time and did n't realize that was now a thing 
 within a few weeks word had spread far enough that a manager went to see the 'electricity theft floor director saying it seemed like a major issue that techs could n't charge their phones anymore because of his strict directive 
 apparently they discussed various solutions like having some lab test lines switched to open ids specifically for this - but the number of locations we operate in including contractors made this a fair bit of trouble and got the floor director to instead escalate the issue to the division 's vp who then issued a <unk> directive ... ... <unk> the entire policy 
 the way it was explained to him it was just about saving a few dollars off power costs and it did n't seem worth it anymore 
 having completely forgotten it was originally intended for security purposes he wrote it off 
 right now everybody is allowed to plug in their phone or a usb stick in their workstation for any reason and could be a few clicks away from copying whatever <unk> information they want 
 people were happy to be able to charge their phones again and so far nobody <unk> it but things like this make me wonder whether the whole company is just secretly recording us for a comedy show 
 not only was the initial 'fix utterly insufficient but they failed to remember it 's purpose ... and then rolled it back because a few people decided to joke about it 
 you ca n't make this stuff up 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 i receive at ticket saying the above but had something i needed to do so i called afterwards 
 please note its around 4:30pm on a friday afternoon before easter weekend 
 i call the landline which keeps ringing and finally <unk> to her cellphone 
 i hear someone pick up and there 's loud music and the person yelling ... & gt user : hello 
 i ca n't hear you & gt me : hi this is <unk> from <unk> calling about the ticket you submitted a few minutes ago 
 & gt user : i really ca n't hear y ... oh i 've left the building already 
 can i call you back 
 im on the plane and im about to go under *click* ... ..i 'm sorry you 're about to go under 
 on a plane 
 should i call someone 
 maybe 911 sorry if this is n't strictly tech support but seeing as it plays a large factor i thought it was relevant 
 **background** : i 'm still in college 
 my soon to be husband is graduating ahead of me and since my credits oddly transfer to whatever communication program exists in the world i 'm looking for jobs for both of us somewhere out of the american south 
 i 've worked tech support for my dad 's consulting business and all his clients since i was knee high and while i 've never been it it was what everyone called me 
 i freelance in social media marketing to help put myself through school which is about as difficult as you 'd think it is as in not really at all 
 older computer illiterate people just do n't understand the internet but can really be getting into a younger market with a little bit of help 
 i have a rate that turns out at about $ <unk> $ <unk> depending on how much of my help they need 
 because i work in a lot of really <unk> businesses i often help the owners fix computers and set up their phones on the side 
 i 'm very <unk> to genuinely confused clients and bosses 
 today a small marketing firm out of a major new <unk> city called me for a phone interview 
 everything had been going really well and i had spoken to them several times 
 we even had a time set up for an <unk> interview in march when i would be in town 
 the employees i 'd dealt with were super nice and there had been no red flags up to this point 
 i 'd actually become rather close with a specific guy who i 'd talked to and emailed multiple times over the last few weeks and who i know is a redditor 
 we 'll call him geoff '' 
 i had his extension number and his personal email address 
 the person on the other end for the interview was significantly older than anyone else i 'd dealt with 
 he sounded like a late 50 's <unk> who would have been better suited for a manufacturing plant 
 he starts giving me <unk> asking how i 'd respond to them 
 really weird things like if one of our clients made cupcakes that killed one out of every three customers how you would respond to that '' 
 every time after the second sentence of my response he cuts me off saying ok that 's enough <unk> '' 
 after about 20 minutes of this he suddenly asks do you know anything about resetting wireless routers 
 we really need someone to do that 
 we just had to fire our it guy because he kept messing up 
 lying bastard anyway would always clear his internet history 
 you do n't do that do you 
 because only liars do that '' 
 i spent a couple of seconds in complete silence wondering what the hell i just heard 
 i eventually said yes i do know a good bit about networking setups 
 what seems to be the issue '' 
 he then details how he tried to install this browser tracking and keylogging software on the network so that he knew his employees were n't liars 
 he had also installed security cameras so that he could see how much they were taking breaks 
 i needed to be ok with that 
 i also helped him install a wireless mouse 
 now he was speaking really loud 
 i had to turn down the volume all the way on my phone and still had to hold it away from my ear 
 by now i was sort of scared that the employees did n't know about any of this 
 i decided to <unk> telling him that was going to have to talk to my fiance and see if the dates lined up for when he first needed me 
 i obviously was n't taking the job 
 he wanted me to start as soon as possible 
 i got off the phone and immediately called geoff 
 i asked him if he 'd heard any of that 
 he confirmed that he had heard everything and that no one had been aware of what was going on 
 he 'd checked his processes and there it was a <unk> as well as some other random software installed that dumped everything he 'd done during the entire day into a file on his boss 's pc 
 he told me he 'd call me back 
 he had to call a lawyer then quit 
 he called me back later and told me the entire office did just that 
 25 people 
 they 're starting their own firm and have invited me to join once they get on their feet 
 the owner had died a year or so ago and this guy had bought the business 
 his previous job 
 head of sales for a <unk> making company 
 **tl dr - big brother is revealed in a phone interview entire office <unk> 
 ** **edit** just got a text again from geoff 
 though he did n't give me any information on how his boss was doing it apparently he was recording every phone conversation in the place and saving it without <unk> anyone including the person on the other end 
 there had also been some discrepancies with pay with half an hour being taken off somehow or being made to work an hour longer 
 apparently even though most were <unk> he had been docking their checks for every minute spent on <unk> activities 
 they 're hoping they can sue him just on the phone conversations alone 
 *previous tales from dishonest used car dealership* & gt ”so why is it that the red one is so much slower ” mr. ferrari one of our <unk> was in my office at dishonest used car dealership attempting once again to get me to fix something that wasn’t broken 
 & gt mf : “i drove both the red one and the grey one over the weekend and the red one is just <unk> much slower 
 there’s no way i can sell it with how slow it is 
 it’s not even <unk> he was on a tirade about our <unk> 
 as you may remember from the story where one made a <unk> on me we would buy <unk> <unk> vw <unk> at auto auctions and then spend nearly $ 10,000 in parts and labor swapping in vw <unk> <unk> into them 
 this had the side effect of making them even slower with the benefit of them getting exactly the same <unk> fuel economy as before 
 in fact slow does not even being to describe it 
 they were positively <unk> 
 & gt me : “look you submitted a trouble ticket this morning i gave both the grey one and the red one a drive and i can’t tell the difference 
 they’re both <unk> - all of ‘em <unk> & gt mf : “i don’t understand why this is so difficult 
 it’s pretty clear to me what the problem is 
 the grey one has a turbo and the red one <unk> & gt me : <unk> both have tdi engines in them 
 they’re both turbocharged 
 all <unk> are turbocharged that’s what the t in tdi stands for 
 now if there’s something wrong with the red one it might not be building boost pressure and it would feel <unk> 
 i can have a tech troubleshoot it but we’ll have to bill for it.” & gt mf : “no you’re not going to charge us a f*cking thing because whatever tech put the tdi in the red one just forgot to put the turbo on it and that’s <unk> fault not <unk> before i had a chance to <unk> the bizarre <unk> he was operating under he marched out 
 now to people who don’t know cars turbochargers must seem like magical devices 
 i suspect people who don’t know how they work think they’re like a lightning bolt sticker or something that you just stick to the side of the engine block 
 <unk> you are now officially turbocharged 
 this <unk> <unk> the right to make more <unk> they’re actually very simple and clever devices turbochargers - instead of routing the engine’s exhaust directly out the exhaust pipe it’s made to spin an impeller first <unk> energy from the exhaust 
 that impeller spins a compressor which <unk> air into the engine’s intake more air than the engine can otherwise draw on its own 
 more air means you can <unk> more fuel and more fuel means more power 
 but because the turbocharger is mounted directly to the exhaust manifold between it and the exhaust pipe it’s not really possible to just <unk> to put it on 
 <unk> be a big hole there 
 you’d notice 
 i wrote up a repair order and gave it to lord salisbury one of the techs to take a look at 
 *** & gt ”i say i’ll be damned if i can tell what he’s on about.” lord salisbury thunked the repair order onto my desk 
 & gt ls : “it builds boost pressure just fine 
 i get 1 bar of pressure at full <unk> right within spec 
 i put a scope in the manifold - you know those early <unk> like to <unk> up their intake <unk> - but it’s clean enough 
 near as i can tell it’s just as slow as those <unk> ever are but no slower 
 i had a run down the <unk> with the grey one and i’ll be damned if i can tell the <unk> & gt me : <unk> i’ll bill sales for wasting your <unk> & gt ls : <unk> me know what <unk> lord salisbury wandered back to the bay and i paged mr ferrari who appeared immediately from the sales office 
 i tossed him the vanagon key 
 & gt me : <unk> it a drive tell me what you <unk> he took off in the vanagon only to <unk> less than 5 minutes later 
 & gt mf : <unk> you did to it it’s even worse than before 
 i couldn’t even get on the <unk> it’s so slow 
 this is not acceptable 
 i don’t get what the problem is here just quit f*cking around and put a turbo on it ” for <unk> sake 
 i paged lord salisbury and had him bring the grey vanagon around and park it next to the red one 
 we popped open the engine covers on both 
 i indicated to the two of them a <unk> object buried in the engine bay on the grey one 
 & gt me : <unk> salisbury would you agree that this is a turbocharger ” & gt ls : “i <unk> i pointed to the same object on the red one 
 & gt me : “and would you agree this also is a turbocharger ” & gt ls : <unk> & gt me : “so would you agree it is reasonable to say that both of these engines are turbocharged ” & gt ls : “i would <unk> mr. ferrari did not have a pleasant look on his face 
 & gt mf : “i don’t know what the point of this <unk> <unk> bullsh t is but it’s clear to me you two just don’t want to fix what’s wrong with the red one 
 get off your lazy asses put a f # cking turbo on it and <unk> wasting my f # cking time 
 *” and with that he <unk> back into his office 
 lord salisbury rolled his eyes and slammed closed the engine covers 
 we stood out in the lot for a bit trying to figure out our game plan 
 at a certain point mr. ferrari would get fed up enough that he would go to rom and the amazon and the two of them were a whole order of magnitude more insane and unreasonable than he 
 we stood <unk> the two <unk> for a bit just thinking about how we were going to solve this <unk> problem 
 a moment later miami vice my new <unk> stepped out of the office to see what was going on 
 he was a smart kid and a hard worker but he didn’t know much about cars 
 & gt mv : <unk> going on guys ” & gt me : “oh mr. ferrari is a dipsh t 
 he’s got himself all in a <unk> about the red van not being turbocharged or <unk> & gt mv : “well it isn’t is it ” lord salisbury and i gave a <unk> look 
 miami vice explained his reasoning 
 the moment he said it it was <unk> obvious 
 *** & gt <unk> dude can you get me a quote on a new turbocharger for an early tdi 
 2000 <unk> ought to work.” i was on the phone with my contact at the old volkswagen dealership i used to work at 
 he was a <unk> old man who knew these cars inside and out 
 he was grumpy <unk> and <unk> to pain <unk> 
 he was great 
 & gt him : <unk> not cheap 
 you have one blow on you 
 you know it’s usually not the turbo on these it’s often the <unk> <unk> sticking or a clogged <unk> & gt me : “no no i just need a price on a turbo 
 it’s a long <unk> he laughed 
 he had been around long enough to know what was going on 
 & gt him : <unk> like with your discount it’s $ <unk> & gt me : <unk> 
 hey do you have part number <unk> in stock ” & gt him : <unk> like i’ve got three 
 you want it on your weekly delivery or you want it rushed ” & gt me : <unk> 
 this afternoon if i can have it.” & gt him : “you got it 
 you want that turbocharger on the truck too ” & gt me : “uh ... yeah i guess why not ” *** later that afternoon a white van bearing the vw logo pulled into the driveway 
 the driver tossed me a box with a turbocharger and a small envelope inside and drove off 
 i summoned lord salisbury to the red vanagon 
 & gt me : “you wan na do the honors or shall i ” & gt ls : “oh i suppose i can muster up the strength to do it.” i handed over the envelope and from it lord salisbury pulled out a part 
 he cleaned off a spot on the lower right of the back of the van and with all the <unk> he could muster placed the part in its new home 
 he stood back and admired his handiwork 
 there on the back of the vanagon shone in all its glory a little chrome badge that read “turbo” 
 we had previously stuck a turbo badge on the grey one just as a joke since it was so <unk> slow and now the two matched 
 this was miami <unk> great insight 
 the grey one said “turbo” and it had a turbo 
 the red one did not say turbo '' <unk> it must not have one 
 brilliant right 
 undoubtedly at some point the lack of a badge on the red one had registered somewhere in mr. <unk> primitive lizard brain and now it was <unk> at least <unk> his perception of the <unk> performance 
 lord salisbury <unk> off his hands and went back to work on his other projects for the remainder of the afternoon 
 as for me i summoned mr. ferrari who appeared in a moment from his office 
 & gt me : “i had lord salisbury do a bunch of work to the engine today including <unk> on a brand new turbocharger from <unk> & gt mf : “oh good you even got the little badge on <unk> good he noticed 
 & gt me : “what i’d like you to do is drive the grey one first then the red one and tell me whether you think they drive about the same 
 sound like a plan ” mr. ferrari climbed into the grey vanagon and went off on his test drive 
 a half hour later having driven both he came into my office positively beaming 
 according to him the red one drove like a brand new car and it was easily the fastest vanagon we had 
 in fact he had half the office staff give it a drive and everyone agreed it was a speed demon by vanagon standards 
 from then on we added a turbo badge to every diesel vanagon we built 
 it was never an issue again 
 oh and the repair order 
 somehow someone accidentally billed sales for a $ 1200 turbo replacement rather than a $ 20 badge 
 lord salisbury somehow got paid 6 hours of labor to stick a badge on the back and an extra tdi turbocharger somehow wound up in inventory but i don’t know anything about all of <unk> call of the day 
 it 's short but good for a chuckle 
 & gt person : can you fix my email 
 mine is pink and the other person 's is yellow 
 mine needs to look like hers 
 my manager and i took a few turns asking questions to try to narrow it down until we just decided to have them send us a picture 
 turns out they were using different applications 
 file this one under <unk> local town does a massive new years <unk> party where they have a massive band stage and get a concert going and fireworks and its a real show 
 being <unk> we know how to drink a lot and being home with parents i went out with a few old mates from school 
 so there we go i drink a lot and we go to the concert - allowed in and we are there <unk> then this small guy comes up to me : $ smallguy : <unk> <unk> from school who was awesome with computers right ” $ me : <unk> who are you again ” $ smallguy : “i was in the year <unk> you anyway can you do us a massive favour seeing i organised this all and were having a issue with the <unk> $ me : “whats the issue ” $ smallguy : “the computer is not working that control is all - the team can not get it to start and i thought you could - seeing you did a few cool things - could you get this to <unk> i just look at him and think “really they want me to go to a wet football ground and get a computer to work and take me away from <unk> i just said “no i can not do <unk> $ smallguy : “but you work for $ <unk> right ” $ me : <unk> but what that has to do with it ” $ smallguy : you do work for $ <unk> 
 your obliged to do this work ” i know i can not do work as i’m drunk as i’m out of office and off call and i just say : $ me : <unk> them i can not do anything ” this guy just walks of and at midnight i pulled my phone out to record the fireworks and the event and the countdown ends and the small guy comes on stage saying t : <unk> are delayed because $ me and $ <unk> are useless and refuse to get this fixed 
 $ me - the smart kid from school is here and he has refused to do anything as he so full of him <unk> i just get this abuse thrown at me while i’m recording in front of a few thousand <unk> we just walked off into a bar and i just emailed the clip to my boss telling him to have a look at it 
 the fireworks did go off in the end when the guy turned up about a hour later $ smallguy called him after me 
 i get an email back from my boss the next day thanking me and that he had spoken to the company about it and that he was in disciplinary and i also got a email from one of the top <unk> i been told that they are going to do a personal apology to me and the company in a local news paper and i know from the email thread that they almost lost a contract over that… tldr : i refuse to do work as i was drunk and wouldn’t be <unk> or anything - me and the company gets called out in front of everyone as <unk> previous two 
 it takes more then one meeting to plan a christmas party 
 apparently 
 i sat down in the executive floor waiting for my fellow christmas party <unk> to arrive 
 nice arrived at the office almost the exact same time i got up to fetch a coffee 
 & gt nice : no don’t go 
 sorry i’m running a little late 
 i looked over at the coffee machine then back to nice 
 & gt me : just going to get a err… 
 & gt nice : errrr… 
 i looked into her eyes they seemed hurt i was trying to leave 
 & gt me : no 
 nothing 
 & gt nice : oh good 
 so next up we need to decide on colors 
 & gt me : colors 
 & gt nice : for the <unk> and balloons 
 & gt me : i don’t think they have balloons at a christmas party 
 i think that 's birthdays 
 & gt nice : a <unk> 
 without balloons 
 & gt me : christmas is more <unk> and <unk> lights 
 & gt nice : hahaha nice try 
 she smiled wide 
 i think she thought i was joking 
 doesn’t matter 
 balloons are nice right 
 & gt me : so colors 
 & gt nice : when i think it i think grey black 
 & gt me : that 's depressing 
 her smile lost some of its edge 
 i felt bad 
 the edge was nice 
 & gt me : err maybe whites and silver 
 white black and silver go together right 
 & gt nice : grey too 
 excellent 
 so what costume are you going to wear 
 & gt me : errr… i hadn’t given it a thought <unk> a costume that always holds a mug of coffee though 
 & gt nice : i want to color match with you 
 & gt me : so kinda like going together 
 the thought was interrupted by the new security manager arriving at the meeting room 
 & gt hsec : hey airz i was told since its your year to manage the christmas party and you where head of security for most of the year it should be a joint security and it christmas party 
 & gt me : errr… & gt hsec : don’t worry i won’t get in your way just anything you need come get me okay 
 i thought it was odd how awfully nice he was being 
 must be the lack of coffee in the room 
 & gt me : oh thanks hsec 
 hsec gave me a smile then turned to look over at nice 
 & gt hsec : oh hey nice you know since we’re organising this <unk> 
 & gt nice : mmm 
 & gt hsec : perhaps we should go together 
 <unk> next hi again tfts 
 i am delighted to report that my favorite users to date have made first contact 
 you can find the original story here : i arrive at my desk tuesday morning and sit at my desk for probably the first time in february i 've been dragged from site to site and am excited to stay in my office and work on some remote administration for a change 
 i open our ticketing system to get the lay of the land and notice two tickets from this morning 
 they are from someone named jake working at the same address as the two diesel <unk> who had so impressed me with their <unk> to read manuals on their computers before using them 
 the tickets are like nothing i have seen before 
 instead of it 's broken '' or come fix <unk> '' or even someone put porn on my google '' i am looking at a block of text all capital letters too but i 'll spare you that reads something like this : computer inventory number <unk> : computer powers on but does not successfully power on self test 
 computer at no time reaches windows boot screen 
 computer instead beeps in a pattern consistent with $ mobo user guide 's description of a ram hardware failure 
 need technician to confirm and/or replace 
 i am floored by this ticket 
 as i am reading the second one a third pops up 
 since i am the only person in our office right now i lock up and drive across town to the garage 
 on arriving i find my way back to the room where i left the <unk> previously and let myself in 
 inside a kid of maybe 20 is seated at a laptop with a <unk> at each shoulder 
 they are both holding <unk> and barking orders at the kid who i presume is jake 
 my two favorite users positively beam and greet me in turn 
 one of them turns to the <unk> and tells him to get his ass back in the garage 
 he <unk> his hat off the desk and <unk> out of the office looking a bit <unk> 
 they have 4 machines with problems 
 one they have diagnosed with hardware issues and the other 3 are having problems with product keys or <unk> software 
 i am impressed by their work but i am curious as to how they figured out some of these issues i inquire into this and they tell me that jake had told them about something called internet search engines '' 
 on discovering that navigating the internet required the use of a keyboard they had forced jake to do all of their searches this had apparently started on friday of the previous week ticketing and emails 
 they successfully figured out using some kind of <unk> google-fu that the motherboard was the part that was beeping and that it had a manual that spelled out exactly what its complaint was 
 they then <unk> every single problem to the best of their ability and started submitting tickets first thing this morning 
 i was very impressed 
 i boxed up the problematic machines and told them to expect replacements later that day 
 i drove them back and dropped them at the it <unk> to be fixed up and placed an order for 4 *new* machines to be sent back 
 the head tech and i agreed it was time for us to treat these guys so the tech office started a pool and bought them a fairly nice bottle of whiskey to be delivered with the laptops 
 when i dropped everything off they were delighted 
 they told me i should bring my fellow techies over on friday after work to drink and talk shop 
 and for probably the first time in my life i am looking forward to spending time with my users 
 tl dr : somewhere far far away a kid looks over his shoulder before pulling out his smartphone 
 previous why do all good offices get ruined eventually 
 a new ticket review system had recently been set up 
 it allowed users to give feedback on completed tickets 
 it was tedious 
 i sat down at my computer 
 the business consultant walked into the office 
 & gt con : so we need to go over the reviews for the last few days 
 i looked down at the list of reviews i couldn’t think of a worse way to spend an afternoon 
 & gt me : yes i’ve already taken a look… the business consultant started smiling 
 it was weird 
 & gt con : oh but you haven’t been through it with me yet 
 & gt me : alas i have been without your valuable insights perhaps you read through these and i’ll go fix some … 
 <unk> then we can pool our thoughts at the end 
 & gt con : what needs fixing 
 coffee wasn’t around for ideas 
 & gt me : errrr… 
 & gt con : plus we never get any alone time it’ll be good to go through this together 
 & gt me : oh 
 i need to wash out that smelling laptop… & gt con : hahaha hardly urgent 
 okay open up the first review 
 i stared down at the computer finger hovering over the enter key 
 might as well get this over with 
 *click* & gt <unk> it i loved the <unk> 
 everything was back-up in under 15 minutes 
 thanks again — finance <unk> & gt me : <unk> 
 & gt con : oh my looks like someone loves it 
 not much we can get outta that one 
 next 
 *click* & gt <unk> again for the loaner laptop this one didn’t smell 
 i hear you got a bad one in the batch now 
 : still keep up the good work 
 — sales <unk> i stared at the screen what was happening 
 & gt con : another positive review good god airz and here i thought i was the only one here that liked you 
 & gt me : sorry… what 
 & gt con : <unk> 
 *click* & gt **i give you <unk> 
 everything was done as expected 
 — <unk> three good reviews in a row 
 & gt con : eight out of ten 
 yes 
 write that down somewhere 
 room for improvement it seems 
 & gt me : yes 
 eight out of ten 
 *click* i started reading the first line of the review it was glowing 
 i was interrupted from going further by the business consultant 
 & gt con : i think that’s probably enough for today 
 don’t want to stop you from the laptop 
 i smiled without coffee around 
 it felt good 
 & gt me : oh its hardly <unk> 
 & gt con : no no i think perhaps this needs some tweaking 
 tweaking 
 dangerous word 
 very dangerous indeed 
 next a end-user who read too many things online about new technologies to extend battery life convinced himself that there were already working phones on the market that <unk> not need to be recharged at all* and insisted so much they convinced one of our <unk> out in the field 
 salesman then called tech support frontline asking about that technology and which brand of our magic phones we should sell him 
 as tech senior staff i get escalations from frontline employees who do not know what to answer 
 all too often incredibly silly stuff gets to my desk but that day i was n't being called about magic batteries just listening to the call for mandatory evaluation as the salesman <unk> to management after being told we had no magic <unk> ... about a minute into that call ... & gt auggie - the frontline tech : no i assure you we 're not currently selling any phones that do not need to be recharged and though some experiments are in progress and documented on the internet about <unk> from the radio frequency spectrum to extend battery life no such device is <unk> anywhere 
 your customer got worked up over something that basically does n't exist yet - but i can tell you which of our high-end smartphones have the <unk> battery life '' 
 & gt salesman : no no the customer showed me all about it online on his phone we have phones now that do n't need to be charged anymore 
 maybe we 're not selling them ourselves but they 're out there 
 if you do n't know about it please escalate immediately i 'll hold '' 
 frontline 's purpose is precisely to ensure that escalation staff has to handle the least amount of frivolous calls as possible 
 they 're there to filter the insanity and though they sometimes fail to i liked auggie 's <unk> a lot 
 & gt auggie : no 
 i 'm sorry but i have enough relevant information and knowledge already on this topic 
 i 'm paid precisely so that i filter calls where no additional input is needed so that their much smaller department does n't have to spend time on trivial issues so i would be not doing my job 
 what your customer wants is n't commercially available 
 since i 'm 100 % sure of that i will not escalate '' 
 & gt salesman : give me your supervisor 's name and phone number now '' 
 auggie gave him that information as he was supposed to - but then the salesman still insisted to hear from tsss so he very politely hung up 
 <unk> work 
 i looked at other logs and confirmed he had no issue escalating real issues to us he just knew this one was n't worth our time and said no 
 when his supervisor got a call from the salesman a minute later the supervisor also confirmed it was proper policy to refuse to escalate if a tech is certain he knows the right answer already and then did what they have to do per procedure anytime someone complains about something technical - have my department listen to the call 
 that 's why i was listening to this whole thing 
 frankly i love it when everything went just right despite a complaint and everyone followed procedure like this it takes my mind off all the times things get screwed up spectacularly 
 since the salesman who was easily convinced magic batteries are available was n't tech staff let 's say that part does n't count 
 but what about the meat of the story the issue of magic batteries that do not need to be recharged 
 well it 's not wholly made up 
 there 's a lot of money being spent to extend battery life and it does n't just boil down to packing in more <unk> and making displays more <unk> 
 these are the ways devices <unk> maximize battery life but there really are some serious research efforts out there <unk> for better solutions 
 such as a <unk> for a phone case which <unk> lost power back from the device 's radio frequency <unk> to give a limited boost to battery life 
 for a few years there have been studies and experiments about wirelessly harvesting power from the rf spectrum at large and other sources to reduce - and some hopeful say eventually eliminate - the need for manual battery recharge on efficient <unk> devices 
 energy harvesting in general is fun to read about 
 but it 's nothing <unk> when it comes to mobile phones right now 
 there may well come a day when we can commercially sell phones that only have to be recharged if you used the screen extensively thanks to these efforts 
 but today is not that day 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 yesterday afternoon i received a call from my former boss 
 my company was recently purchased by a larger company and he decided to stay with the part of the company that was n't part of the purchase 
 we have a <unk> in place so i get calls from time to time to help out 
 when they built out their network they did their best to mirror what was in place before so they bought all the same equipment and configured it pretty much exactly the same 
 they are trying to setup their new network and he asked if he could take a look at things since they could n't get authentication to work 
 it 's been going on for two weeks and they just ca n't figure it out 
 sure not a problem 
 i 'm a juniper engineer but i 've <unk> with ad before and i have no problem giving a hand to the guy that hired me for this gig 
 we go through the <unk> and everything looks good 
 i found a couple issues but once we got those <unk> away it should have worked 
 it was close to <unk> so he told me he 'd do some testing in the morning and we parted ways 
 this morning my phone rang and it 's my old boss again 
 <unk> we still ca n't get authentication to work right 
 can you take a look at this '' 
 we fire up a <unk> and he starts logging into the dc through the <unk> when i notice that the time on the server is the same as the time on his laptop 
 i also know that the server he 's logging into is a <unk> away from where he is 
 i asked him when they moved that server to the home office and he said the had n't but wanted to know why i asked 
 well i see that the time is in central time 
 i thought that server was in the eastern time zone '' 
 & gt * '' yeah i got tired of being confused about the time zone difference so i just set the clock back an hour 
 * & gt '' oh so you just changed the time zone '' 
 & gt * '' nah i just rolled it back 
 * & gt '' that 's weird ... ntp should n't allow you to do that '' 
 & gt * '' i disabled ntp 
 it kept fixing the time 
 every time i 'd log in it would be back to eastern time and it was pissing me off 
 * i was n't sure what i should say at this point 
 i was actually kinda dumbfounded 
 i calmly explained that <unk> has <unk> strict time controls and that when he changed the clock the way he did he broke everything 
 & gt * '' that ca n't be it 
 the time on the laptop and the server are the same 
 it 's within that 5 minute limit you 're talking about 
 * again i explain that because he left the server time zone set to eastern and the laptop was set to central there was actually an hour difference 
 i told him to <unk> ntp and try again 
 & gt * '' that 's not going to work 
 * & gt '' please just humor me on this one '' 
 ntp gets enabled and he goes to do his test and all i hear come across the phone was ... & gt * '' well i 'll be damned ... thanks <unk> i 've got ta run 
 * click 
 i decided to forgo that other cup of coffee for my blood pressure medicine after this incident but i thought you guys would get a kick out of it 
 read my second story in /r/talesfromtechsupport & gt <unk> ticket <unk> & gt i ca n't enter call data into the customer service page it just sits there when i click save 
 i call the user up and get remoted into the users computer i instantly see the problem 
 it 's happened rather frequently the past week or so so i instantly close out all of her open browser windows and head to control panel 
 remove the coupon commander ask toolbar yahoo toolbar aol toolbar ... .. 20 minutes later during a reboot she finally asks ... & gt user : we 're those causing all of the issues with call data 
 & gt me : yeah any browser <unk> can mess with the customer service app 
 & gt user : well how did all that stuff get installed 
 & gt me : you had to install them at some point it 's pretty hard for them to get installed without someone <unk> the install 
 & gt user : well i never installed that stuff it must have been on the computer when i got it 
 i do n't respond not worth the effort to fight with her over this on a short day before a holiday 
 her computer comes back up i have her log in and she enters the calls perfectly 
 & gt user : thanks that fixed it can i show you something else that 's wrong 
 & gt me : sure i 'm still connected 
 she opens her downloads and i see a row of ask toolbar installers 11 copies of the adobe reader installer various other installers for stuff that she really should not install on her work computer 
 & gt user : when i install this it does n't work and i am one of those coupon queens it would be great if you could fix it 
 & gt me : ma'am you have 17 copies of ask toolbar installer various other apps where did those come from ... & gt user : well it came up and said it would improve my internet experience if i installed it and the internet is kind of slow sometimes so i thought it would help 
 & gt me : so you installed the toolbars 
 & gt user : i installed these toolbars but they improve the internet not slow it down 
 & gt me : those toolbars are the things that were causing the problem with the call data it was preventing you from working 
 & gt user : no those improve the internet not stop it from working 
 & gt me : ok i 'm going to make a few more changes to your system 
 i removed her power user rights and deleted all her <unk> improving applications she had downloaded 
 i sent her the computer use policy to review and resign highlighting the parts where she is not allowed to install any <unk> related applications on company equipment and i cc 'd her boss 
 *** <unk> instantly replied that his people have to be able to install software and i shoot him back a copy of the chat log from the remote session 
 i tell him if he can convince her that installing things that break work related things is bad she was n't getting install rights back 
 he elevated to his boss and his boss told him to train his staff better 
 i 'm a very calm & amp reasonable person 
 i can count on one hand the number of times i 've raised my voice in a professional setting and this was one of them 
 many years ago i worked for an msp that supported a large corporate office 
 my team was responsible for the usual desktop support - hardware issues software installs etc 
 one day i get a ticket that a machine wo n't boot so i head on over there to check it out 
 when i roll up on this desk i 'm greeted with the sight of the pc completely disassembled 
 and i mean completely - every component is out and spread out very neatly on the desk all the way down to the mb 
 what 's um ... what 's going on '' 
 i had never encountered an end-user tearing down their machine so i was n't quite sure how to process this 
 the user looks over and says oh good are you here to put my computer back together 
 the other guy said he 'd send someone '' 
 who 's the other guy '' 
 you know the new guy 
 he said he 'd fix it for me '' 
 i have other tickets piling up so i figure i 'll figure out mystery guy later 
 i <unk> everything turn the machine on and i see right away that it 's not booting because someone left a floppy disk in the drive 
 i pop it out and everything is fine 
 after things slow down i go on a hunt & amp eventually piece together what happened 
 another department outside of it had hired an engineering student as an intern 
 he was good with computers '' so they asked him to look at this machine & amp see if he could fix it 
 he took it apart to look for problems '' and then could n't remember how it all went back together panicked and called it into the helpdesk as <unk> wo n't boot 
 i 'd love to say that he got canned for that but turns out he was the son of someone important in the company 
 he tried an internship with engineering but could n't keep up so they shifted him over to the business unit rep team interface between users & amp it 
 this was apparently the second machine he had completely <unk> so i had some rather harsh words with him about where his responsibility ended which i clearly defined as anything short of physically touching a pc 
 he was there for another 6 months before he went back to school where rumor has it he eventually failed out 
 i still imagine he 's out there somewhere randomly taking machines apart as his first troubleshooting step 
 previous a good coffee sat on my desk a smile on my face 
 it was a good day 
 i looked down at my to - do list 
 it said : & gt <unk> <unk> <unk> & gt <unk> <unk> so essentially empty 
 lovely 
 a knock at the door <unk> my peace 
 it was the head of security 
 & gt hsec : airz have you got a minute 
 i looked down at my coffee 
 i took a sip 
 tasted like danger 
 & gt me : sure come in hsec 
 & gt hsec : hey is that coffee 
 & gt me : yeah 
 i took another sip 
 & gt hsec : could we talk away from it 
 & gt me : from the coffee 
 & gt hsec : yeah we can talk in the break room 
 & gt me : but why 
 the head of security gave me a worried expression but reminded silent 
 & gt me : fine lets compromise ill just finish this cup 
 i downed the whole coffee 
 tasted like a mini victory 
 & gt hsec : so i was doing my weekly security <unk> & gt me : woah you do a weekly security audit 
 & gt hsec : how else do you know if everything is secure 
 & gt me : i had a check list when i was security head 
 & gt hsec : oh a checklist of items 
 do you still have a copy 
 i smiled it was easy to smile with a belly full of coffee 
 & gt me : not on paper 
 i can tell you it though… my checklist was & gt <unk> stuff stolen : <unk> & gt hsec : errrrr… 
 how <unk> 
 & gt me : worked for me 
 the smile felt like <unk> on my face 
 & gt hsec : anyway on one of my weekly audits i realized i didn’t actually have keys to any of the it rooms 
 & gt me : no you wouldn’t 
 & gt hsec : can i get the keys off you 
 so i can get copies made 
 my smile left didn’t even say goodbye 
 time to get serious 
 & gt me : unfortunately due to an incident involving a security member taking home it equipment security doesn’t have access to it rooms anymore 
 & gt hsec : but we need the keys to all the rooms 
 & gt me : why 
 nothing inside those rooms needs securing 
 & gt hsec : okay airz i understand you <unk> security after that incident but the security guard who stole obviously isn’t still working here 
 & gt me : actually… 
 & gt hsec : seriously 
 okay which guard is it i have to go see human resources 
 & gt me : oh no he’s working down here in it 
 the stare and silence i managed to receive after that sentence was almost endless 
 & gt hsec : so … 
 are you insane 
 weird thing was i didn’t know anymore 
 <unk> next this is another tale from the late <unk> 
 let me set the scene 
 i had a rich uncle he was a senior partner in a major civil engineering firm who had an even richer neighbor played the <unk> in <unk> <unk> 
 the neighbor had one of the original really expensive garage door <unk> 
 expensive but very cheaply built 
 no remote just <unk> your <unk> to <unk> the door 
 his problem was that the door would activate randomly even in total quiet 
 my uncle told him that i was pretty good with electronics '' so he called me and offered me $ 100.00 if i could fix it as it was driving him crazy 
 that was a small fortune to a teenager in the late 1950 's so i hopped on my <unk> and got there as fast as i could 
 when i got there i checked out the electronics and found that it used a microphone obviously a <unk> audio <unk> strange <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pentode section for <unk> and a <unk> section for detection and relay activation ending with a sensitive <unk> relay <unk> 
 while i was there it activated and put the door down 
 i did n't hear anything so i started thinking about sneak signal paths power line noise etc 
 i went home got a pair of <unk> headphones and my homework and returned 
 i attached the headphones to the input of the detector and could hear myself making minute noises that were being picked up by the microphone 
 this was a good sign 
 whatever was activating the system would be audible in the headphones 
 i started doing my homework while listening to the headphones 
 & gt '' <unk> tower this is <unk> 123 '' <unk> was the name of the major international airport in new <unk> city later <unk> to <unk> 
 we were nearly under the approach to one of the <unk> 
 * up went the garage door 
 the cable to the microphone was about 1/4 <unk> at 120 <unk> <unk> to the <unk> right in the middle of the aviation band 
 back to the <unk> got a <unk> <unk> capacitor and soldering kit 
 connected the capacitor from the pentode 's grid to ground and closed the garage door 
 finished my homework with no further garage door <unk> collected my $ 100.00 and an <unk> of the latest play the neighbor was performing in and went home 
 another happy ending : happy neighbor proud uncle and much much richer <unk> used to work for a website hosting company 
 it was actually a call center for 3 later 4 hosting companies with various names that all were owned by the same company and run in the same datacenter 
 it 's a slow day 
 i take this call from some guy and he 's super pissed about a <unk> that was making traffic to his server screech to a halt 
 admins were <unk> traffic and getting it under control it would probably be resolved within 30 minutes or so but he wanted an instant fix which i could n't guarantee 
 he got pissed off and said he 's <unk> his hosting account then hangs up the phone 
 next call i get ... it 's the exact same dude 
 but he called one of the other <unk> 
 he did n't recognize my voice somehow 
 we had talked literally five maybe ten minutes prior 
 obviously he did n't do any research on hosts and just searched for a rate plan he liked 
 he rages that he 's super pissed with <unk> brand* and wants to switch to *our main brand* because he 's sick of their crappy support and wants help <unk> his data to this new account he created 
 by the end of the call he told me my service was great and he was really looking forward to working with our support team as he migrated his data 
 yeah ... same support even the same agent in this case 
 lol same equipment same datacenter literally the same everything except the color scheme in the account management software 
 i did n't correct him 
 if he was too dumb to research any of the alternative options he had and this information was so easy to find then i did n't pity him at all 
 i remember stumbling across his account like two or three years later and there was an email from him thanking us for our amazing service and switching to that company was the best thing he had ever done 
 lol ... his data maybe moved like 50 feet to another row of servers 
 and that new '' server his data moved to was older and had lower performance <unk> part 1 here 
 first off i love you guys all you guys : p *** i quickly set the <unk> app to notify me when the employee changed his status from in office to meeting 
 then i went in the cold room and got one of the spare laptops pulled the drive and dropped it into a hdd cradle 
 a few seconds later i had a blank hard in hand as i was heading up the hallway towards no it land 
 as i turned the corner i see the employee heading into the developer manager 's office and i see the door close 
 i look around nonchalantly and see the hallway is empty so i let myself into the employee 's office 
 i step around to his laptop push the power button until it powers down and then whip out the <unk> 
 i flip the laptop over and i remove two screws a few seconds later another flip and i push the power button 
 i watch as it begins to post a small grin at the missing operating system '' message and then i head back to my cave 
 once i get back to my office i drop his drive into my hdd cradle then i start it <unk> it to an image file 
 i tab around doing a few things while the drive is imaging and smile at the new mail *ding* i tab over and find 
 i got him out of his office for 10 minutes i could n't think of anything to keep him out of his office any longer 
 was that enough time 
 i start to reply to his message when my phone rings 
 & gt me : hello you got it how can i help you today 
 & gt employee : hey yeah this is buck over in development 
 i came back to my computer and it says missing operating system that 's bad right 
 & gt me : yeah that 's bad what 's the tag number on your machine 
 & gt buck : <unk> it 's a <unk> laptop we got them about six months ago 
 did i lose all of my data 
 & gt me : well it sounds like something is wrong with your disk 
 *i tab over and see that the drive is about halfway done imaging 
 * i 'll come up in a second let me send this email 
 & gt buck : ok thanks i 'll be here in my office 
 i tab over to the email reply to developer manager 
 he has a hardware issue i 'm going up to see what is going on exactly 
 i grin at that and head up towards buck 's office the developer manager is at his door with a very pale <unk> 
 & gt devman : what happened why does his computer not have an operating system 
 & gt me : i do n't know i 've not had a chance to look at his laptop 
 i can give you an update once i 've had a chance to look at it 
 & gt devman : that man has stuff that has to be completed on time you better not have done something to cause him to miss a deadline 
 i do n't think i 've ever wanted to <unk> slap a man and tell him to slow his roll more than at that point 
 & gt buck : he did n't do anything to the laptop yet i just called him 
 & gt devman : i know what he does around here i just want it fixed 
 buck actually looks more uncomfortable about the situation than i am with developer managers attitude 
 & gt me : i 'll update you once i look at his laptop it might be something simple 
 i 'll come by your office *i point down the hall at his <unk> and tell you what i find out 
 developer manager stares at my finger for an uncomfortably long time then turns away with a huff and heads towards his office 
 buck and i share a <unk> and he moves aside so i can get at the laptop 
 i do the once over checking for thumb drives disks in the dvd drive and then i force a reboot and go into cmos 
 & gt me : well it see 's the hard drive and the boot order is set right 
 & gt buck : so the drive is just suddenly blank 
 & gt me : not sure at this point i 'm going to take it back to our area and test it i 'll give you a call when i have an idea about whats going on with it 
 when do you normally clock out for the day 
 & gt buck : 5pm then i 'm gone until monday 
 & gt me : long weekends are nice 
 & gt buck : son is getting married his fiance 's parents are paying for most of it so that means we have to go out of state 
 i unplug his power adapter keyboard mouse and speakers then stand 
 & gt me : well congratulations i 'll try to get back to you asap 
 & gt buck : thanks to be honest i 'm kind of hoping you do n't get it fixed 
 *laugh* & gt me : well i 'm found of those <unk> chips in the <unk> machine 
 *laugh* it 's probably something simple i 'll call you back shortly it will either be a quick fix or a few hours of replacement parts 
 i head out of his office and turn towards the developer managers office 
 i knock on the door frame and see another <unk> about to come out of him 
 i decide i 've heard enough 
 & gt me : wait do n't say a word or before this is over what did you say exactly was it i 'm going to have your head '' 
 he does n't say anything but i can tell he is thinking <unk> awful things about me 
 & gt me : not a word ... .i 'll have his laptop fixed in about <unk> mins well before the time he normally leaves the office 
 and you feel the need to show your butt like that again after dragging me into a world of lies then the next meeting with hr wo n't be about your inability to submit a form 
 he looks about ready to pop i give him another finger the <unk> in a hold on gesture 
 & gt me : if you 'd submitted the form when you first started this mess i would have done this while he was at lunch three hours ago 
 any stress this is causing you is your fault and i will not be verbally abused because you are stressed about something 
 i smile and turn to leave his office i figure that one will come back around to bite me but that 's fine wo n't be the first time he 's cried about something i said 
 *** back at my desk the drive is almost done imaging so i turn his laptop over and pull the tray to remove the blank drive 
 i stick a sticky note on it with the word bad drive <unk> warranty <unk> 
 his drive finishes imaging and then i mount the image to check it has what appears to be proper file structure which it does 
 i plug his drive back into his laptop replace the cover and turn it on windows loading screen pops up and i go to the cold room to get a power adapter 
 on the way back to my office supervisor comes in with a frown on his face 
 & gt supervisor : did you threaten to harm the developer manager 
 & gt me : maybe here you listen to what i said 
 *i toss him my phone* while he listens i go back the laptop and get the power adapter hooked up windows has a message up about improper shutdown and not to do that again 
 i look through the drive and it seems to be ok i shutdown the laptop properly and close the lid 
 & gt supervisor : did he really say 'i 'm going to have your head '' 
 & gt me : in an email want to see it 
 & gt supervisor : no just do n't <unk> that pot anymore than you need to ok 
 & gt me : *laugh* ok did you listen to the one prior to that recording 
 with a deep sigh supervisor hands me the phone and turns to leave shaking his head in what i take to be resignation 
 first things first i head back to buck 's office and offer him a repair hard drive 
 i let him know that i re-seated the drive and ran <unk> it seems to have fixed the issue 
 he seems happy when the laptop comes up to the windows screen and even more delighted when he does n't appear to be missing any files 
 i remind him to send a help ticket about his hard drive issue and wish him a safe journey out of state 
 i go down to the developer manager 's office but the door is closed and i hear some heated conversation coming from inside his office 
 i decide i will let him know everything is green with an email and head back to start the investigation 
 *** i send developer manager an email letting him know that buck 's laptop is repaired and back in his <unk> 
 i then drop the 'bad drive in the cradle and start to image the file to the disk 
 i go to the cold room and grab the spare laptop missing it 's 'bad drive 
 back in my office i am delighted to see that buck did send the help ticket as requested 
 developer manager 's response to my email is a short and somehow <unk> <unk> 
 i close out some help tickets while waiting on the drive to finish imaging once it is done i plug it into the laptop 
 windows boots up i get a machine name conflict and quickly disable the wlan adapter 
 i get it plugged into a router to hide it from the rest of the network but allow me to get to the internet 
 got ta be able to read reddit while all this crap runs right 
 i start by scanning his computer for files out of place we generally look for <unk> etc ... occasionally you find a huge stash of music on computers which is n't necessarily a bad thing unless they are clearly downloaded <unk> 
 it 's amazing how many times people claim they ripped a music cd down to a folder named <unk> <unk> <unk> it 's just said to see a guy set a boat on fire to fix the leak in it while he 's headed for a waterfall 
 sometimes we find things in strange locations ... <unk> kid had 100 <unk> hidden in his <unk> folder for some strange reason 
 i start filling in the check boxes and getting rather frustrated that this did indeed seem to be a <unk> hunt 
 this guy has nothing on his laptop that would be considered improper 
 program and features is clean he does n't even have solitaire installed 
 i copy his firefox profile over and set it to launch by default and open up firefox 
 his browsing history is extremely boring the only thing i find that 's not work related is a tendency to listen to various sermons on youtube 
 he 's got dropbox installed and he 's saved his password in his browser i peek but there is nothing there as well 
 i open up the training site and i see he 's been spending a ton of time on the training for the next wave of software 
 but he 's a developer maybe he is reviewing the documentation before it 's <unk> to the customers 
 i log his internet activity i attach a report of the past 28 days from the proxy server and the data report from the firewall 
 i run a file type report and save it to the investigation form as well he does n't have enough media files to break the line on the pie chart 
 i am really beginning to think this is a waste of time 
 i open up <unk> i see he has a nook someplace i got back to see if i overlooked some <unk> i find about a dozen 
 mostly web <unk> books one <unk> <unk> 
 i add that to the report i <unk> the file type report to include <unk> files not enough to change the pie chart 
 i save a screen shot of <unk> it does n't have anything that screams look at me 
 i decide to take a break and head over to supervisors office 
 & gt me : hey i 've not found anything worth trouble on his hard drive 
 there was nothing in the logs before he seems to be a super boring person as far as his computer use goes 
 & gt supervisor : really 
 well when you get the job done let me know and i will take it to developer manager 
 i do not think he wants to hear how boring this guy is and i do n't want you taking <unk> head from them 
 even if he only seems to use it to hold up his hat sometimes 
 i laugh and wave as i head out of his office i run by the software testing guys and replace a fuser in a laser printer they 've been working it pretty heavy printing stuff recently 
 i get back to my desk and finish up the snoop job 
 i run <unk> and save that report yet another boring list of boring files opened by a boring guy 
 i finally go back and archive his user folder his browser profiles and save a copy of the disk image file 
 i type up my report in the form and send it to supervisor for review 
 i head home and forget it about it to the best of my ability 
 *** i 'm up and about early the next morning thinking that maybe i got a <unk> issue figured out 
 that or i had a very strange nightmare involved workflow loops 
 i get a call on my way into the office 
 & gt me : hey this is me let me know what this call is about 
 & gt supervisor : hey do n't explode on me but i got ta ask 
 did you do a thorough job on investigating buck 's pc 
 & gt me : yes ... & gt supervisor : why do i feel like i 'm in physical danger 
 you are n't in the building yet are you 
 & gt me : i would n't hurt you i know you 're just doing your job 
 but yes i did as much investigation as the job required 
 the guy is super boring he has no activity that would cause use to report him for it to his manager or hr 
 the worst he had was a bunch of random religious sermons in his browser history 
 & gt supervisor : how are religious sermons bad 
 & gt me : they are n't 
 but that 's the worst he had 
 i 'm telling you the guy 's machine was clean his web reports are clean he does have a ton of traffic to the training site but that may be work related 
 & gt supervisor : ok i 'm meeting with developer manager in a few minutes i just wanted to make sure 
 & gt me : alright talk to you later 
 i get to the office and spend a good 20 minutes answering email questions about store membership card spam 
 no matter how many times you tell them someone always wants to get their free points to a store they 've never been to before 
 i 'm working on a mean green <unk> and watching some reports process when i get a visitor 
 & gt devman : i need you to go over that laptop again you missed something 
 & gt me : i did n't miss anything there was nothing there to find i can look again but the report will be the same 
 & gt devman : ok then i want access to check it myself 
 i stand up and grab the laptop i offer it to him he looks surprised 
 & gt devman : so i can look at his computer to see why he 's having trouble meeting deadlines 
 & gt me : sure have at it i would n't get to excited though it 's not exactly his computer at this point 
 it 's a copy of his computer but it 's a clone of what he left with yesterday 
 & gt devman : oh ok i will give you a call if i need help 
 & gt me : you do that you can login as an administrator to the laptop and look until the <unk> come home 
 you might have trouble connecting to some things on the domain 
 & gt devman : i can get to the internet on it <unk> right 
 surely he is n't this dumb ... & gt me : yes you can get to the internet but you will have trouble running internal apps or accessing some of the servers 
 but the internet should work fine 
 & gt devman : ok thanks 
 he turns to leave and i turn to send an email 
 this is a notice that developer manager has the cloned machine to do a personal review of the activity of the user 
 i sent it to supervisor hr devman and developer director 
 i went back to the reports sending them off to their destinations and wondering why devman had it in for buck 
 i get curious ... i log into the project server and i run a report on buck 's assigned jobs i do n't see a single missed deadline 
 i do n't see any outstanding deadlines either which is odd 
 he is the only developer that does n't have anything <unk> 
 one of the new hires appears to have <unk> part of bucks normal responsibility and he is missing deadlines pretty consistently 
 i print this stuff to pdf and go back to finish up my reports 
 soon i 'm visited by supervisor and hr who both look a bit nervous standing in my doorway 
 & gt me : did one of you spill the milk again 
 & gt hr : no but why did you send that email 
 & gt supervisor : yes are you trying to cause trouble 
 & gt me : devman came in and wanted me to look again to find something on his employee i told him there was nothing to find 
 he then requested to look himself and he seemed very interested in getting to the internet on that laptop 
 & gt supervisor : surely you do n't think he 's going to fake up something and get us to find it on another pass 
 & gt me : i do n't think he 's going to fake something up i 'm sure enough that i already put a c note on it 
 amazing what vegas <unk> will accept a bet on these days 
 <unk> <unk> the side door is going <unk> today 
 supervisor laughs and hr looks more confused 
 & gt hr : so he 's going to browse something non work related get you guys to find it and then ... .what 's he trying to accomplish 
 i tell them about the project server and i <unk> that he 's wanting to get rid of buck for some reason 
 i point out how the new guy is doing the training data and how nothing new has been assigned to buck recently 
 hr <unk> up his hands mumbles something and goes stomping off leaving supervisor standing in the door mouth <unk> 
 & gt supervisor : seriously 
 & gt me : <unk> devman wanting to do a snoop job without the form on a guy that has n't missed a single deadline and who apparently has a brother than eats four whole chickens for lunch 
 & gt supervisor : four whole chickens 
 & gt me : it 's a <unk> brothers joke one of the brothers eats plain white toast while the other brother eats four whole chickens 
 & gt supervisor : oh because he 's a boring computer person right 
 i nod and go back to my <unk> workflow supervisor tells me to keep him informed and heads back to his office 
 *** read part 3 <unk> had that odd smell of glue about it that’s how i knew it was that time of year again 
 compliance time 
 & gt me : seriously though what is a compliance department 
 & gt comliguy : for the hundredth time we keep the workplace safe 
 now can we <unk> get on with this just select the sticker you think works best 
 he’d delivered a lot of stickers 
 piles of them 
 i wondered how anyone could even bother making this many different types 
 & gt me : why 
 again 
 & gt comliguy : seriously 
 look these stickers are going to be placed on everyone’s computer case 
 warning them that if they’re not a trained technician they should not open the computer 
 how is this that hard for you to understand 
 most of the stickers had a big warning exclamation mark 
 my personal favorite was the sticker that had a skull and cross <unk> with the warning <unk> <unk> 
 i’d already tried to select it but alas it was apparently too shocking 
 “the right sticker for the right <unk> i was told 
 & gt me : i’ve worked in it for years 
 very few people ever try and actually <unk> a computer 
 & gt comliguy : <unk> <unk> 
 so you admit some try 
 these stickers are for those <unk> safety 
 & gt me : couldn’t we just ... you know ... let them try 
 compliance department <unk> seemed oddly attached to the idea of putting stickers on everything 
 recently they’d placed stickers on all the doors encouraging people to remember that doors are pinch <unk> 
 & gt comliguy : let them try 
 they could get <unk> 
 & gt me : so they’re getting a free lesson in electrical safety 
 bonus 
 i could tell the compliance guy was getting increasingly irate about my lack of enthusiasm for the stickers 
 & gt comliguy : how can you be so flippant about employee safety 
 & gt me : i think i enjoy the <unk> spirit of an untrained employee blindly opening up a computer 
 & gt comliguy : you ... like it 
 it’s so dangerous 
 they’re untrained they’ll probably be doing more damage than they fix 
 <unk> eyes scanned the room i could tell he’d noticed my door did not have a pinch hazard sticker 
 i’d <unk> it off 
 it was ugly 
 & gt me : i’ve an idea 
 & gt comliguy : an idea for ... the stickers 
 clearly stickers were the only thing on this guy’s mind 
 i started to question his sanity 
 & gt me : why don’t we just hire smarter employees 
 you know ones that wouldn’t get a hand trapped in a door 
 or ones that wouldn’t try and pry open a computer when it isn’t working ... & gt comliguy : you don’t have to be dumb for <unk> to happen 
 & gt me : so the stickers help ... how 
 compliance guy almost completely lost it 
 his love for stickers could not take my <unk> 
 & gt comliguy : placing stickers over the case will be another barrier of entry for people trying to open them 
 they’ll read the sticker before breaking it which would tell them they should be calling it 
 this will save you time 
 how are you not getting this 
 & gt me : i guess i just find it hard to believe that someone who has gone out of their way to find a screwdriver take out any screws in the case and attempt to pry it open would be stopped by a sticker 
 in fact i’m surprised you think people even read the things 
 & gt comliguy : we’re just trying to make the workplace safe 
 we need people to just read the directions 
 comliguy clearly had enough of me not accepting his one true love 
 stickers 
 he grabbed the pile of stickers off my desk and walked to the door 
 he reached out and gave it a push 
 the door wasn’t opening 
 he struggled with it for a few moments 
 then he gave the door a mighty kick 
 it swung <unk> with great force and <unk> off the wall behind it hitting him as he made his way out and managing to knock his pile stickers onto the floor 
 & gt me : perhaps we need a sticker for that ... 
 don’t open the doors with too much force no no ... don’t kick doors ... .. or maybe ... <unk> door hazard 
 i looked over at the compliance guy madly scrambling after the stickers he’d dropped 
 i began to feel a bit bad 
 but then i noticed the pinch hazard sticker <unk> on my door 
 he’d stuck it on well 
 <unk> texts come <unk> all texts are from one of my managers 
 <unk> : one of the exam rooms is down 
 unable to get on the network '' <unk> : please come look @ exam room 1 '' <unk> : i hope you arent working on the firewall because there are patients coming in today '' 
 <unk> : cable possibly broken '' **i leave to go check the exam room 
 ** <unk> sees me walking to the <unk> manager : don '' t touch it 
 we just got it to barely work '' 
 jess me : i 'm it i have to touch it '' 
 **i walk into exam room 
 she has the power cable to the monitor taped to the monitor and the cable is barely pushed in 
 ** **i push in the power cable all the <unk> jess me : all fixed '' 
 manager : thank goodness 
 i was afraid you were working on the firewall during <unk> '' 
 jess me : no of course not 
 have a good day 
 we used an old web filter that was managed by the suppliers 
 we had to email them to allow a site to become unblocked because software = ai and did n't get everything perfectly correct 
 corporate admin sent round an email stating that the company had an account with a well known ticket provider for national <unk> services and we were to use that with the supplied login to book travel tickets and check timetables if required 
 first call of the day : & gt customer : i need adding to the adult content group on the web filter 
 & gt me : why 
 <unk> was n't an unusual request as some services had access for <unk> & gt customer : i 'm trying to access a website and it states that it 's blocked for adult content 
 & gt me : what 's the site address and i 'll check 
 if it is incorrectly classified i 'll raise a ticket for this and we 'll get it sorted 
 *i had access to all sites for this <unk> & gt customer : www dot new train ticketing <unk> & gt me : are you sure 
 i remote to his machine and he is correct 
 his browser is displaying the blocked for <unk> adult content '' 
 i check the site out on my machine and there is no adult content 
 i then log the call and raise it with the supplier 
 before they 've had an opportunity to look at it there are 20 more calls for this 
 same site same issue 
 it manager wo n't allow access to the adult content filter to everyone because obvious reasons 
 finally we get a resolution form the suppliers 
 they are unable to <unk> the site no explanation other than it 's a technical issue and not a policy issue so it stays blocked 
 one can only suspect the level of adult content that is <unk> in a train <unk> 
 <unk> on patches <unk> crazy tales : ** one column ... just one ... 
 ah another saga from my past 
 so here i am ... three inches of hard copy bug reports and i noticed there was one coming up again and again 
 one regional office was complaining that a sales report was taking 45 minutes to run 
 this was originally designed to run at close so run time was never an issue 
 however during sales pushes upper management asked for hourly updates - which would lock the pos while this report ran 
 i asked $ itspaz who have been there for awhile 
 & gt $ itspaz : the customer is lying 
 it does n't take 45 minutes 
 & gt $ me : oh 
 how so 
 & gt $ itspaz : we ran it on the test machine and it only takes 5 minutes 
 now for those who know sql 5 minutes is still ridiculously long for a query 
 however why would a customer repeatedly escalate to the director that the queries took 45 minutes 
 i personally think that customer perception can be <unk> but there usually is an issue if the customer is reporting something this specific 
 so i decided to take a look at the test machine 
 about to date myself big time here 
 it was a <unk> 64 meg ... totally state of the art 
 that would be fine except the regional offices ran <unk> with 2 meg ... huge difference 
 i gave the order to dismantle the top of the line machine and turn it into a workstation somewhere 
 i wanted a test machine that was identical to the regional office 
 & gt $ itspaz : but the report will run slower 
 & gt $ me : really 
 i am shocked 
 i finally got a legit test machine 
 another thing i noticed was $ itspaz was only testing a single day worth of data instead of a month aggregate 
 after the store closed that night i created an exact duplicate of their system and ran it on the test machine 
 45 minutes ... <unk> 
 quick review of the code for some reason it deleted the indexes and rebuilt them before processing the numbers 
 there was no legit reason to do this as indexes were automatically rebuilt any time the system was rebooted 
 there were some other issues going on in the code building <unk> instead of a properly written select but nothing i was n't able to cleanup 
 the policy of corporate was i had to choose a random store for each software push and wait a week for it to soak before rolling out another version 
 i randomly '' chose the store that had been complaining about the report the loudest 
 amazing how that worked 
 code was pushed out and ready to be tested 
 i ran the report remotely on their system before they opened up and knew it would exceed expectations 
 late morning when store opens i called the $ manager 
 & gt $ manager : oh my god 
 no 
 i ca n't run the report right now 
 i have a line out the door and i ca n't risk locking up the register for that long 
 & gt $ me : all right i understand 
 i know you do n't know me and my group does n't exactly have the best reputation with you 
 when you are ready to test please call me back <unk> you push the button 
 i would like to be on the phone when it runs 
 & gt $ manager : ok but it wo n't be for awhile 
 two hours later ... i get the call 
 & gt $ manager : this better not lock up my register for another 45 minutes 
 & gt $ me : i need you to trust me 
 push the button 
 & gt $ manager : all right 
 here i go ... & gt $ manager : & gt & gt <unk> <unk> & lt & lt & gt & gt sound of printer in background & lt & lt she called her director who called my director to explain that i managed to get the run time down to <unk> that is you push the button it prints 
 this is how any sql based report should run if properly written in my opinion 
 i used that strategy for all of my test locations '' and amazingly turned around corporate opinion about my group in a very short period of time 
 they even had an expose about me in the company <unk> 
 that created its own amusing <unk> <unk> $ intern opens ticket 
 $ intern sends ticket to server team for work to be done 
 server team <unk> work adds notes sends it back to $ intern 
 $ intern sends it back to server team 
 server team sends it back to $ intern 
 $ intern sends it back to server team 
 server team sends it back to $ intern 
 $ intern closes call 
 $ intern <unk> call 
 $ intern sends to server team 
 server team collectively has a <unk> 
 server team sends it back to me and team lead 
 $ intern gets talked to 
 $ intern understands now 
 $ intern does it again 
 <unk> so my dad gets a new laptop no problem right 
 he boots it up usual complaints of windows 8 etc etc dad : hey $ <unk> why is the internet so slow and why does it look different 
 me : it 's because you 're using internet explorer 
 i 'll just install chrome 
 dad : no do n't do that 
 as soon as you installed chrome on my old one i noticed how slow internet explorer was 
 me : yeah that 's because chrome is faster dad : no chrome just downloads a <unk> virus to slow down internet explorer i 'm not installing that 
 in the end i just installed chrome and used the internet explorer icon for <unk> and sweet ... i work with around 400 users - but as you all know you usually get around 12 <unk> as i call them 
 hey % user % whats up today '' deal 
 11 are pleasant and just sometimes need confirmation they are doing things correctly cute and annoying 
 1 however is an arse 
 do this do that '' ... he regularly phones and complains that i am not fast enough in sorting issues out ten minutes after a ticket opens is not fast enough no toilet for me 
 he is always deleting files by mistake trying to send emails around 50mb ... give me all permissions i dont need ... etc etc ... '' it stops me doing my job '' attitude 
 so ... ... one day he phones me up in panic mode 
 i have sent an email and the person is on leave so wo n't get it can you delete <unk> it before he gets back from leave '' ... you can hear its not just a sensitive email situation where figures or the like have been sent to the wrong person 
 so i go and see the email he has sent 
 he is <unk> his boss and cc 's him in the email 
 can you get my email back '' ... .no i didnt hear from him after that and got a user delete request from my boss 
 shame 
 **edit : i know you can recall emails yourself on exchange you know this ... but he didnt 
 **i wanted to share this story because the sweet taste of justice 
 the problem is this is not exactly it related and i do n't know if this is the right channel but we hear about sewing machines lawsuits and dishonest car shops so i 'll give this a go 
 this story happened <unk> years ago and is mainly about by dad 
 my dad was a great business man and had build a great company that sold advanced cable monitoring systems and safety system for large <unk> specifically those with highly automated assembly lines 
 i did tech support for my father during those years and we always talked about large events around the dinner table 
 so one night my dad looked really puzzled 
 we did n't really have <unk> subjects in my family so i inquired : & gt $ me : hey what 's up 
 & gt $ dad : i do n't really know 
 i got this lawsuit today but i ca n't remember this order or project at all 
 & gt $ mom : where is it from 
 **my mom remembers everything 
 ** & gt $ dad : from pissed off company 
 & gt $ mom : i do n't remember that either 
 let 's figure it out after dinner 
 we lived right next to the office which was just a house out in the country so they went to work after dinner and i went to my room to fix my computer 
 now my dad sold his company some years back before this story <unk> to a business friend in a different country and was <unk> as the acting ceo of basically the same company he sold 
 good money and a good position 
 at this time my father was 50 years old and at some point he might retire 
 this move was great because it was easier to leave the company and his employees would still have work security 
 in total the company was in 4 countries with one head office which meant 4 acting ceo 's and one to rule them all 
 some days later my parents found out more about the order and had contacted the company that did the lawsuit to get some more details because they could not remember doing the order at all 
 and this was a close to 2 digit million dollar order 
 those were rare and was something you would remember 
 they requested a copy from the contract they received 
 when they got the contract it just became weird 
 my fathers signature was on the contract 
 no one in my fathers company could remember a thing about this 
 so my father <unk> me into browsing their system for any clue i could find 
 i collected everything i could from the project and gave it to my father as i could only find the information but not really understand the <unk> of it 
 a week later i came home from school and i could hear my father yelling 
 loudly 
 like i have never heard before 
 i learned some interesting profanities that day and i found out why 
 they have been piecing through the stuff i found 
 apparently the ceo 's from the other countries thought that the order was really good to get from pissed of company 
 but they also knew that the <unk> of failing was high 
 so to protect them <unk> they made the contract in my fathers name found a digital copy of my fathers signature and used it on the contract so he was responsible without telling him 
 being my father he would not stand for that sort of abuse 
 he called his lawyer a damn good one and the day after a resignation was sent out 
 but my father has worked hard to get a lot of agreements from different vendors to make his company the sole distributor of products in his country and these contract were worth millions of dollars each year 
 and my dad wanted to start a new company and he wanted those contracts 
 now the law here stated that an employee may not use information from previous workplace to start a new one 
 an nda is normally in place for <unk> years 
 my dad went to court and got the nda <unk> 
 the company location was in a building that my father owned so he terminated the contract immediately almost throwing them out in the street 
 he sent job offers the all the employees to work with him at his new startup everyone accepted 
 last i saw the old company they only had one guy working in a <unk> office in the city and had lost millions the following years because my dad took all the contracts and customers 
 that day he went to court he came driving home <unk> celebrating and flashing his lights when he reached our house 
 we went out to eat a very nice dinner and then went drinking dancing and playing dart 
 i remember some young girls next to us playing <unk> as well while my father was dancing asking : & gt $ girls : <unk> ... do you know him 
 & gt $ me : yep that is my dad 
 i said proudly & gt $ girls : awesome 
 i never knew what happened to pissed off company contract but my gut tells me my dad made a new contract with them that was successful 
 tl dr : company uses fraud against dad 
 its ineffective 
 dad destroys company and goes drinking 
 edit : the usual suspects <unk> <unk> 2 : there seems to be some confusion as to how the company was structured 
 the company has offices in 4 countries and those offices were sort of independent from the others but shared the same product catalog with some exceptions 
 kinda like a franchise 
 hope that cleared things <unk> company that i work at requires documentation for issues as i 'm sure the <unk> you all work for do as well 
 when documenting a ticket what do we call these folks 
 usually either customers users or clients depending on where we work what we do and who we help right 
 well i work in a place where the people i help are my co-workers some higher some lower but all co-workers none the same 
 here was a call from a while back ... *ring ring ... ring ring ... * **me -** robot here do n't give me a reason to open the <unk> on a tuesday morning what 's broken 
 **luser -** hi 
 how are you 
 good 
 great 
 so i am trying to access my co-workers mailbox through outlook and it says folder can not be expanded '' when i try to open it and i need to help them because they are out on pto 
 **me -** alright 
 what is the users email address so i can check their permissions on the exchange server 
 **luser -** what 
 **me -** the user you are calling about 
 the one you need access to their mailbox while they are on pto 
 **luser -** they are n't a user ... **me -** they do n't work for <unk> 
 **luser -** they do ... they just are n't a user 
 **me -** do they not use our computer systems or network 
 **luser -** they do but they are n't a user 
 we drug test when we hire they do n't use 
 <unk> it all 
 <unk> the <unk> drinking commence 
 **user : i do n't have any of my network drives 
 me : ok let 's start with a reboot 
 user : 5 seconds later ok done now what 
 me : you rebooted your machine that fast 
 user : yeah it 's one of the newer ones so it 's pretty fast 
 me : sir computers do not reboot that fast please start with a reboot so that we can see if that fixes the issue 
 user : i told you i already did that 
 me : ok hang on a second 
 at this point i just sent a shutdown over the network user : what 's going on my computer just turned off 
 me : the first step of the process is to start with a reboot and since there seemed to be a problem with the one you just did i just forced another one just to be sure 
 user : if that was actually gon na fix it i would have rebooted it but i already know that wo n't do anything 
 i have had this problem before and there is something you have to do to the server to fix it there is nothing wrong with my machine 
 mind you we have about 80 servers me : ok when the pc comes back up please login 
 user : after about minute fine whatever now what 
 me : are your network drives back now 
 user : yeah they 're there see i told you all you had to do was fix the server 
 thanks bye 
 - quick hang up <unk> fucking <unk> <unk> time poster long time lurker 
 i 'm not in it but i 'm <unk> with computers* '' so i get called over to help a lot of users with computer issues that usually end up being some simple fix 
 i also see a lot of posts here about these simple fixes and i thought hey would n't it be cool if there was a vigilante tech support hero who instead of <unk> the <unk> problems <unk> the easiest 
 would n't it much more interesting to share these simple fix tales of mine if i were cast as a hero 
 so i bring you a <unk> over tale of one such simple fix 
 in the world of t1 tech support ... there is a <unk> 
 a vigilante hero 
 operating outside of it 
 a man whose only powers are : turning it off and on again stating the obvious and <unk> good with computers* '' he is the two minute fix & gt ** $ user : ** help my emails are n't coming through '' 
 & gt ** $ twominutefix : ** i 'll save you '' 
 *whooshes office chair to $ user 's desk* & gt ** $ twominutefix : ** aha 
 it appears you have set your outlook to filter oldest emails on top just click here and ... .. done 
 your emails are now back ''

 & gt ** $ twominutefix : ** my job here is done '' 
 *whooshes away on office chair* edit : bonus comic thanks <unk> previous the vp looked up from his desk as i opened the door 
 he gave me a smile 
 why a smile 
 i wasn’t happy 
 & gt vp : come in airz sit down 
 coffee in hand i accepted the seat i could see the vp’s secretary outside the door she mouthed <unk> at me 
 i tried 
 & gt vp : you know why you’re here 
 i knew no one down in it had done any tickets for almost a day 
 i didn’t feel like saying that out loud though 
 & gt me : complaints 
 the vp’s smile got even <unk> 
 & gt vp : yes many 
 want to go through them all now 
 or explain yourself 
 & gt me : i err… 
 i looked down at my coffee its depths were murky 
 i looked over at the vp’s secretary she just looked scared 
 something felt wrong 
 & gt me : i don’t feel that great right now 
 the vp looked me up and down 
 i <unk> over at the bathroom longingly 
 & gt vp : you look alright to me… & gt me : i feel really sick i think i’m about to throw up 
 & gt vp : no you’re not sick 
 we need to get back on topic the complaints 
 & gt me : oh 
 yes 
 & gt vp : well 
 what do you have to say about them 
 i looked down at my coffee again it was swirling 
 i don’t remember stirring it 
 & gt me : i <unk> heard what they are 
 & gt vp : you don’t sound like you care very much 
 & gt me : i feel sick 
 & gt vp : you’re 
 not 
 sick 
 okay how about we change tactics a little <unk> & gt me : okay 
 my head started pounding 
 & gt vp : lets look at the current ticket queue see how big it is 
 i’d dumped all the tickets from the ghost account into the normal queue the queue was <unk> & gt vp : normally <unk> 20 tickets on the open queue on a normal day right 
 my ears started ringing 
 & gt me : yeah so listen i feel really sick 
 my ears are now ringing 
 & gt vp : that 's because everywhere is ringing what the hell is going on 
 the vp’s secretary opened the office door 
 & gt vpsec : vp since you asked us to <unk> all the systems a fire drill has been <unk> 
 remember you’re the fire marshal you need to be outside organizing everything 
 & gt vp : a fire drill 
 now 
 i’m the fire marshal why wasn’t i told about this 
 & gt vpsec : well it wouldn’t be a good drill if you knew it was coming 
 & gt vp : call it off 
 i need to manage this it situation 
 & gt vpsec : we can’t turn off a fire drill mid drill 
 & gt vp : yes you can 
 get the security manager on the phone get him to call it off 
 the vp’s secretary gave me a look 
 i was too busy avoiding <unk> on the carpet to see what it was 
 & gt vpsec : i can’t 
 remember the phones aren’t working like you said before… i’ll have to run that message down to him 
 the vp looked angry 
 mad even 
 & gt vp : the phones are fine 
 just call him 
 & gt vpsec : if they’re fine why couldn’t we use them to send a message to airz before 
 & gt vp : because he needed to be escorted up here… how are you not … you know what… fine 
 i’ll deal with this 
 the vp picked up his office phone i could hear the rage from my chair 
 ring 
 ring 
 ring 
 & gt vp : he’s not f* % $ ing answering 
 & gt me : its been ten <unk> he’s probably <unk> 
 & gt vp : fine 
 we’re going outside 
 i looked over at the bathroom i really wanted some water on my face 
 & gt me : i should <unk> 
 & gt vp : no 
 you stay in sight 
 after this is over we’re coming back here and finishing this 
 next again i am supporting the professors using classroom technology at a large university 
 a little background : our interfaces on the instructor 's podium include an hdmi cable a vga cable and an ethernet cable so that you can hook up to the projector and get on the internet if your wi-fi is n't working 
 a professor calls me and says she is having trouble getting her mac to show on the projector 
 no problem we get these calls all the time she probably just needs an adapter since apple would never include a common video interface on one of its laptops 
 me : are you using a vga or hdmi <unk> '' 
 her : i do n't think i am using an adapter i 've got it hooked up already its obviously the projector that is broken since i cant see it on the screen '' 
 me : what cable did you use to hook it up without an adapter 
 how old is the computer '' 
 i am wondering if this is some kind of new mac that i have n't heard of that has an hdmi port her : oh i used the modem cable it was the only one that fit '' me : modem cable 
 what do you mean 
 there are only three cables on the podium and none of them are ... '' her interrupting me : its the one that looks like it goes in a modem 
 see i do n't really understand all this new technology that 's why i got a mac it 's easier than a computer '' 
 she 's referring to the ethernet cable as a modem cable and thinks that will carry video to the projector automatically 
 me : i see well unfortunately that 's not going to work 
 you will need an adapter to hook up your mac to the <unk> system 
 you can come by our office anytime to pick one up '' her : i do n't have time for all that i have to give this presentation right now 
 i 'll just use the modem cable '' me : good luck '' 
 it concerns me that this woman drives a car on the same road as me alright i 'm not actually it support but a <unk> at night to fund college 
 few days ago i got the following mail & gt '' due to recent events <unk> handles the <unk> and fire alarm is no longer allowed to work in the server rooms <unk> please call <unk> whenever their employees need to work on <unk> '' turns out their service guy turned off some of the ac systems in the server rooms because he was cold '' 
 it also turns out that calling the emergency ac guys at 3am on a sunday morning because of critical temperature in the server room is n't exactly cheap 
 no matter how trivial the solution is 
 & gt '' have you tried plugging it in '' here 's the context i used to work tier 1 tech support in a corporate office you know intern stuff 
 you all also know there 's always that one problematic user that no matter what you do you ca n't <unk> 
 they just exist to make your life difficult 
 well this time things were different because you see it was my last day 
 we 'll pick up from where the ticket begins & gt luser 's ticket : i cant get to $ <unk> no additional info no <unk> no error messages great 
 alright sounds like a compatibility issue to me lets give them a ring and gather more information you know as in do my job 
 & gt yci : hello im calling regards towards the ticket you put in are you still experiencing the issue at this time and has anyone followed up with you today 
 & gt luser : seriously youre calling me to ask that 
 how should i know if im still experiencing the issue 
 did you guys do anything at all before calling to ask me this 
 & gt yci : im sorry its just the other techs are n't at their desk and the ticket has n't been updated so i figured i 'd follow up with you 
 can you try and reach the site now 
 & gt luser : i 'm not going to try i dont have time just fix it 
 alright cool looks like i 'm taking a trip to the users workstation to fix it manually i know the site works i could reach it just fine 
 & gt luser : what so you come over here 
 im busy and you need to fix the issue 
 why are you here 
 i did n't want you to come and i dont have time for this 
 just do your job and go reboot the server that runs this stuff 
 even i must know more about it than you if even i know it needs a reboot 
 & gt yci : im sorry its just policy this is how we always resolve issues that we cant close over the phone 
 thats fine though i 'll just go close the ticket do n't worry about it 
 & gt luser : so why did you even come over here then if youre going to go to your desk and fix it and just close the ticket 
 see this is why i told them to stop sending you over you do n't know what youre doing at all 
 i 'll be sure to let your manager know how much of my time you 've wasted 
 & gt yci : oh im not fixing the issue im just closing the ticket 
 when you email me an apology with my boss cced since you were being rude and threatening me over my following of company policy then i will 
 & gt luser : you ca n't say that to me 
 dont you understand im $ <unk> 
 i will see to it youre fired 
 & gt yci : dont you understand <unk> my last day 
 what 'll you do fire me 
 i 'll see to it someone fixes your computer it just wont be me 
 hopefully you <unk> with them 
 in the mean time ill be waiting on that apology 
 i 'm really not normally that bad its just this one user 
 i 've avoided them like the plague since the day i started to the point where i would push tickets to other techs 
 of course they push them back though because i was the lowest on the <unk> pole and they wanted to avoid the <unk> 
 but what ever happened 
 well i sat back down at my desk knowing that entire encounter was worthless that user will of course never be <unk> and that i wasted my time 
 by the way the fix they needed was just for me to add the site to the compatibility list it takes less than 30 seconds and had they not been difficult i <unk> had it done promptly 
 but for once i got to tell a user to get it together and that was all i 've ever wanted 
 previous tuesday morning 
 today marks the first day of the security audit it is a bleak time in it 
 as it leader i <unk> it being free from these <unk> checks 
 free to fix computers and fix them well 
 i looked over at the entrance to our department 
 <unk> the door 
 ** i realise suddenly 
 being a leader of action i walk over to lock it’s door 
 & gt me : this will keep security out 
 the rest of the it staff look at me <unk> 
 & gt solitaire : why <unk> you <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 & gt me : security 
 <unk> raise security to fight the <unk> & gt solitaire : <unk> locking the door will just get in our way 
 & gt me : <unk> as a department need to be free from the injustice of the security <unk> security can’t audit us if they can not even enter 
 it was in shock 
 the department door was always open 
 change to the long established way of doing things had the department <unk> 
 & gt redcheer : keeping people physically out is <unk> job 
 we just need to stop hackers 
 right 
 redcheer looked around the room for support 
 many were nodding in agreement i felt the urge to crush this <unk> quickly 
 i attempted to <unk> the it staff with reason 
 & gt me : it’s easier to keep people out of our systems if they can not physically access them 
 i tried to smile at the it staff but they seemed to be surrounding me in an <unk> manner 
 colourblind put down his tea 
 it was at that point i realized i had perhaps pushed it too far 
 & gt colourblind : no 
 they could do as much damage from any computer connected to the network then from these ones 
 the server room is locked 
 my grasp on the situation seemed out of hand 
 a knock from the opposite side of the locked door distracted everyone 
 & gt headsec : hello 
 this door seems to be <unk> solitaire walked over and unlocked the door for the head of security 
 who i could oddly only hear in a french accent 
 & gt headsec : who locked this door 
 the room turned to stare at me 
 i realized it had somehow <unk> themselves with who i thought was our common <unk> security 
 & gt headsec : it’s a fire hazard to lock this door you know 
 & gt me : oh 
 defeat 
 next i work as senior staff at tech support for a big telco where tech work is neatly <unk> between multiple departments 
 being technically able to fix something yourself does n't mean you 're allowed to if it falls outside your department 's job description 
 because too many things are broken we do skirt those rules on the <unk> when we deem it critical i 've defended that at times - and even wrote tales about it - but for routine tasks and problems we tend to respect the rules 
 our internal tools are handled by a dedicated internal it department called systems in my tales 
 that day our manual provisioning tool - key backup tool given how many issues <unk> everyday with regular provisioning - was down 
 i knew it pretty well given i worked on improving some of it 's features ten years before when assigned to a different position 
 it 's a <unk> but it 's aging software with a few quirks and sometimes it needs attention 
 wrote a quick ticket to systems explaining the issue and practically <unk> them through it 
 & gt bytewave - ticket to systems : manual provisioning is down - all tasks sent by tsss are on <unk> hold 
 that 's usually the task queue crashing should clear up if you run the script that <unk> tasks 
 please make a new task to check if it gets processed or not reboot server if issue persists 
 i assumed that could be done pretty quickly 
 awhile later i get a ticket alert from systems assumed it was a <unk> entry until i saw it was an <unk> 
 <unk> your priority ticket to ticket manager - systems <unk> has been escalated to <unk> 
 ** ... probably a <unk> when filing in ticket resolution 
 no 
 no it was n't 
 minute later i 'm on the phone with the ticker manager at systems who handled my ticket 
 & gt systems : yeah i could n't do it myself frontline at systems do n't have access to these scripts nor physical access to that server we need to escalate this whenever this occurs '' 
 our internal it has grown so large that it 's plagued with an issue that normally only customers have to deal with everywhere 
 to <unk> costs the corporation has reduced internal it to a <unk> department where people taking calls and dealing with tickets are paid to filter out simple issues and escalate real problems to people with reasonable access levels and technical knowledge 
 basically management added frontline script-monkeys even internally 
 & gt bytewave : right 
 but that 's not me i never even worked at systems 
 i 'm from tsss i deal with the escalated issues of our external customers not our internal systems 
 and i sent you the ticket so how did it make sense <unk> '' & gt systems : you 're the listed backup for this system and unfortunately the three admins who normally take care of it are unavailable 
 one is on his weekend one on vacation and one <unk> sick 
 protocol is that the ticket be escalated to the backup and it 's you '' 
 ... i was speechless for a second 
 i 'm not formally allowed to do any kind of maintenance on this yet i 'm still somehow listed as a backup admin for the system because i helped with some overdue updates 10 years before 
 on top of that it seems sane procedure to send someone from another department his own support ticket back and tell him to try to fix it himself 
 & gt systems : well i assumed you could do it yourself since you 're listed as backup - might still have a valid login to the remote tool too right 
 you guys at tech support are union staff you get away with pretty much anything right nothing to lose 
 .. but if you ca n't you can send it back and i guess it 'll be put on hold until one of the regular admins can deal with it - probably tomorrow '' 
 yes i still remembered that old login and could have broken the rules to fix it myself 
 we do that kind of thing to keep critical operations running sometimes but i had a bad feeling here 
 the whole thing sounded like he knew i could be convinced to do it myself even though he knew i 'm supposed not to 
 felt like i was being pushed to break the rules so they would n't have to bother handling a real issue that clearly fell under their department - and that 's not how i operate 
 i do n't like to enable terrible policies or be <unk> into someone else 's workload nor setting <unk> like this 
 my tone got a little <unk> right the second i decided what to do about this mess 
 & gt bytewave : i 'm not allowed to perform this task myself at this time company and union rules hence why you 've been sent the ticket 
 i 'm afraid the delay you 're suggesting is unacceptable as manual provisioning is rated as critical internal infrastructure one of the regular admins will look at the issue asap 
 the service level agreement is 90 minutes <unk> '' 
 & gt systems : well like i said there 's nobody who can do it today '' 
 & gt bytewave : no what you said is that one of them was on <unk> and another was sick - hr is not allowed to call either of those 
 the third you said is on his weekend 
 and therefore <unk> for emergency overtime 
 i 'm writing to hr-logistics and my boss to say a ticket for critical internal infrastructure i 'm not allowed to act upon myself has been sent back to me due to lack of critical escalation personnel - at which point they 'll simply have to call him in on ot due to the sla 
 i 'm sure he 'll take it '' 
 & gt systems : emergency ot rates are crazy that 's going to cost like 2 days worth of normal escalation pay you 're sure that 's worth it 
 for running a script '' 
 & gt bytewave : email 's already sent i 'm afraid 
 also asked to be taken off the list as backup escalation for this tool as it 's unfortunately outside my current job description 
 thank you for your help '' 
 & gt systems : err ... 
 sure '' 
 <unk> <unk> half an hour later the single admin eligible for overtime it was a friday and he worked sunday to thursday logged in remotely from his telework station and ran the simple script that i knew would fix the issue with the task queue 
 everything returned to normal 
 he was indeed <unk> quite ridiculously for such a simple thing but some situations make me think the company deserve to just pay up 
 when management hear about this kind of thing and see there are real costs bad tools or policies actually tend to improve for the long haul 
 if we just hide the dirt under the carpet they remain broken forever 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 there are days where i 'd rather be wrestling a couple great whites in their natural <unk> while an <unk> volcano was going off <unk> to <unk> 
 this was one of those days ... the software we support uses the sql database engine 
 the installer has a batch file that runs the sql express installation with the default settings our software requires 
 at times it fails due to windows updates permissions microsoft sucking etc 
 i can walk somebody through an sql install and it 's not too painful 
 as long as they follow my instructions the manual install does n't take too much time but like i said the <unk> of this not taking too much time requires the customer to follow my instructions 
 a remote session failed so i was not getting into this guy 's computer 
 an hour went by no progress 
 **me : ** are you sure you do n't see that folder in the temp folder 
 **customer : ** oh sorry i closed it 
 this is pretty much the story of this case 
 however the <unk> were kind to me as something glorious and slightly majestic happened : he yelled at his son 
 **customer : ** no i do n't want you to take that 
 unplug your computer from the tv 
 i do n't know how you did that 
 my gears start turning 
 this kid is probably running an hdmi connection from his computer into the television 
 this requires him to change the default sound settings and sometimes visual settings 
 it 's a gamble but i 'm bald and do n't have any hair to rip out to ease my pain 
 i began to engage in small talk 
 **customer : ** sorry about hearing me yell at him **me : ** no problem 
 how old is he 
 **customer : ** he 's about <unk> he 's pretty savvy with windows 
 you guys play command and <unk> red alert 
 remember <unk> 
 remember how she 'd go in a somewhat <unk> voice cha <unk> 
 this happened 
 **me : ** oh 
 you think he 'd be able to help us 
 **customer : ** meh maybe 
 this is no longer up for debate **me : ** may i talk to your son please 
 **customer : ** oh sure 
 jake 
 come here and talk to the nice tech guy 
 note we 're about an hour and a half into this 
 i get his son 
 **me : ** hey jake 
 i need you to follow my instructions exactly as i say them 
 if you have questions feel free to ask 
 this should take us about twenty minutes 
 <unk> : ** oh okay cool 
 i was wrong 
 it took 15 minutes 
 so thank you customer 's son for being the light at the end of that issue 's tunnel 
 no there was no bacon at the end of that tunnel as i was wanting 
 but whatever 
 edit : spelled <unk> wrong 
 sue <unk> work as escalation tech staff at a telco 
 like everybody else we offer the standard array of <unk> products including hardlines voip and mobile 
 which of course means we also offer voicemail 
 & gt bytewave : senior line bytewave you may send me your ticket '' & gt frontline : i have the <unk> voicemail tool issue here 
 customer just had their hardline number <unk> to mobile 
 that went fine 
 but they locked themselves out of their voicemail shortly <unk> by putting the wrong pin four times and the tools to fix it wo n't work 
 i tried all the ways i could still would n't work 
 tried sales senior staff as they know tricks with the voicemail but no <unk> 
 so i called switchboards and.. '' & gt bytewave : i have to interrupt right there we at tech support 's senior staff should always be your first contact point for escalation per procedure '' 
 not to mention sales have less than zero to do with this 
 & gt frontline : i know but your line was soo busy ... '' there we go 
 productivity metrics interfering with real work yet again 
 he saw we had many calls waiting due to a regional outage we were in the process of documenting so to avoid damaging his statistics by waiting 10 minutes he started dialing randomly 
 i hate that but the pressure management puts on frontline techs to solve 7 issues per hour leads precisely to this <unk> 
 & gt bytewave : back to the issue at hand 
 portability to wireless caused your customer to switch voicemail systems as you know were still running a separate one for mobile users until they 're merged later this year '' 
 yeah that 'll happen 
 maybe next year at best but i like to use the official timetables 
 reminds everybody nothing is ever done on time here 
 & gt frontline : yeah i know 
 that 's why he locked himself out 
 he was n't told or did n't hear when we told him his pin would reset to default after portability '' 
 ... default pin is <unk> when switching voicemail systems but ... & gt bytewave : in that case the issue is resolved we already know what his pin is and there 's no need for our tools 
 the reason your tool to reset is n't working is because the switch had n't been processed yet by the billing system which this unfortunately relies on 
 we <unk> '' & gt frontline : got it i explain to the customer i 'll call him back tomorrow and <unk> i 'll be able to unlock his voicemail '' 
 & gt bytewave : not quite 
 you ask him not to touch it for 30 minutes and then try again with the default pin '' 
 & gt frontline : ... oh 
 you want to wait out the <unk> ... '' at this point i 'd have been happier to learn he had never been told that these security <unk> only last 20 minutes or that the voicemail was using a default pin but clearly he already had all that information 
 given he tried calling three escalation departments i looked at the timestamps for when his current inbound call got in.. nearly 45 minutes 
 & gt bytewave : actually try it right now with the default pin please '' 
 ... & gt frontline : oh 
 you fixed it '' 
 ... all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 a few years ago i was working tech support in it 
 my client a large <unk> and barge company in my state had called in reporting that their head office had just lost power 
 i told them to let me know when their power is restored so i can check all their servers are online and accessible 
 a few hours later one of the staff called me and it went like this : me : hi welcome to it company this is <unk> how can i help client : hi this is sarah from tugboatco i was told by management to give you guys a call when our office power was restored 
 me : no worries so your office has power now 
 client : ummm i 'm not sure 
 me : you 're not sure if your office has power 
 client : no i 'm not actually sure sorry 
 me : are there lights on 
 can you see people working on their computer again 
 client : hmm i do n't know 
 me : i do n't understand you can or ca n't see lights on 
 client : i 'm not sure i 'll have to have my manager call you i 'm not too good with the technical stuff me : ok no <unk> 
 a few mins later the manager of the tugboatco called and explained that they now have power and he was confused that sarah could n't tell if they had power as they have a large open plan office with not that many windows it would have been very dark in there when they did n't have power 
 tl : dr : sometimes people ca n't even see if a light is on in front of them 
 the auditor looked down at me 
 & gt audit : hello airz just doing a quick audit of the department 
 nothing to worry about 
 i stare back up at him 
 i <unk> with my hands till they find the coffee mug 
 i take a sip 
 tastes like a lie 
 & gt audit : oh coffee 
 you couldn’t knock me up a quick tea could you 
 not coffee 
 i hate him already 
 & gt me : i’ll just go get it now 
 i walk into the break room and the auditor follows 
 <unk> in the cup 
 & gt audit : so how many employee’s do you have in the it dept 
 & gt me : maybe like 7 
 & gt audit : so seven 
 grab the milk out of the fridge 
 & gt me : <unk> 
 the auditor chuckled 
 it was weird to see a chuckle 
 & gt audit : don’t you know 
 & gt me : to be honest 
 no 
 we’ve a half security half computer <unk> walking about does he count 
 & gt audit : that’s my nephew 
 & gt me : oh… the kettle 
 i forgot to put on the kettle 
 next older stories i worked blackberry tech support for major wireless provider several years ago right as they were being bought out by other major wireless provider we 'll call it spring '' 
 one of the two worst calls i received was regarding that very <unk> 
 i gave my overly long introduction got the customer 's full information it took approximately 2 minutes of us demanding information before we were allowed to ask what the customer 's issue was or we would be <unk> for not following the script and asked what the problem was 
 me : and how may i assist you today ma'am '' 
 customer : well first let me start by saying that i am not at all racist '' 
 me : of course not ma'am '' 
 at this point i 'm recounting how the most racist <unk> things i 've ever heard were <unk> by those eleven words 
 customer : well you guys just got bought out by spring wireless right '' 
 me : we uh technically <unk> with spring so now we are the same company '' 
 customer : used to be when someone would call my phone before ringing they would hear 'please wait while the original company customer is being found '' 
 me : yes ... '' customer : well now it says 'please wait while the spring customer is being found 
 ... but then it repeats it ... in spanish '' 
 me : yes ma'am because our customer base is very <unk> we find that it is best to <unk> '' customer : well i do not want people to think i would ever ever associate with someone who would speak spanish 
 i 'm not going to support those <unk> '' 
 me : but ... it 's just a recording '' 
 customer : well you better change the damn recording 
 i do n't want people to think i have anything to do with them '' 
 me : you do n't understand ... i do not have the ability to <unk> the message that goes out to several million <unk> myself 
 customer : you will change the message or i will cancel my account today '' 
 me : okay ma'am '' i responded exasperated 
 but i just do n't seem to understand why it is such an issue '' 
 customer : because if those little people want to <unk> over here in those little <unk> and steal our jobs and ruin our economy then they damn well better learn our language 
 now you send me to <unk> so i can switch to a company that has some <unk> '' 
 at this point my supervisor has come over to listen to the call and is doing everything he can not to fall out of his chair laughing 
 the lady has four phones on her account and is just a few months from the end of her contract -- meaning she will still get hit with $ 800 in <unk> fees because she ca n't accept the fact that other languages exist 
 my supervisor comes over and <unk> my phone 
 let me handle this '' he says with a grin 
 he hits conference '' on the phone 
 this puts the customer on hold and opens another line 
 he types in a number that i <unk> recognize but just ca n't place 
 he hits conference '' again right before the line picks up 
 the phone is muted from our side but he has just connected the customer to this other department who starts to give their intro 
 i ca n't believe what i heard 
 my <unk> supervisor transferred my racist customer to the <unk> helpdesk 
 edit : anonymized '' company name to spring '' instead of its real name as per reddit <unk> lurking i realised some of you might enjoy this short and literally sweet tale 
 i usually would n't warn y'all about formatting because i 'm brutal about making it perfect but posting on this new mobile site is confusing as heck so sorry 
 also i 'll probably forget to reply to comments because i 'm never logged in 
 i used to stay with an older woman and since my new house is near hers i still visit from time to time 
 i also help her learn how to use a laptop when i 'm free 
 to give you an idea of how inexperienced she is i ca n't show her how to use the backspace button because she was taught to use delete '' and it 's too confusing to use both 
 she 's a lovely person and did n't go to school so it 's more cute than annoying 
 today i went over and she tried showing me a video of her friend in the hospital 
 she complains that it 's always hard to find and i notice that it 's because it 's lost amongst a bunch of imessages 
 being the good <unk> i am i teach her how to save the video and she 's so excited about this that i 'm <unk> to help her around her phone 
 after a bit of gentle instruction she 's able to send text messages by herself using the greek keyboard instead of making do with using the english one for greek letters 
 she was so excited that she texted random stuff to all of her grandchildren 
 the amount of <unk> she had in herself made me smile and she said something like my grandchildren always tried to teach me but i always thought i could n't do it '' 
 i do n't know that was badly written but i hope you all enjoyed that as much as i did 
 makes me feel a tad better about the fact that with the degree i 'm studying for i 'm probably going to spend most of my life dealing with incompetent users 
 edit : ok so i totally warned everyone that i 'd forget about this post but i was n't expecting so many <unk> and gold 
 i think i 'm gon na have to start logging in to reddit after i post things : p now to enjoy the random stories in the <unk> would imagine most people here have a story similar to mine if you worked with <unk> support 
 this one however stood out to me 
 late in my shift i got a call for an angry elderly customer who demanded to speak to my boss 
 as standard i <unk> to call before transferring to the boss '' and this was his story 
 for several months he had been in contact with my colleague nora '' danish girl name but she had n't responded to his last two emails and he was furious 
 here is the kicker we only had ~20 people working there and i knew all of them none of them had a name even close to nora 
 the clever ones here already figured this out but like i said it was late in my shift 
 i asked him what email he was emailing us from and went to town on our mailing system nope no mails from the last two months actually no mails at all 
 i asked him to forward the last reply from nora '' to me so i could identify her thinking by now it might have been a phishing email 
 lo and behold he had been emailing us for quite some time always being answered by my colleague <unk> @ company <unk> 
 i spend the next five minutes calmly god bless the mute button to stifle laughter explaining who nora '' really was trying not to hurt his feelings too <unk> came and went another month slipped by unnoticed 
 a new support manager had appeared 
 young new and inexperienced his often <unk> decision making seemed <unk> of angie’s <unk> and brutal idea of management though it seemed driven by <unk> rather than <unk> 
 we continued to exist in the knowledge that there was nobody who would be like our first its manager 
 but thankfully nobody like angie either 
 i had two major projects after angie’s departure 
 i was in the midst of successfully <unk> the laptops complete with fully working software 
 however it became apparent in the days subsequent to her finding out that angie had opened administrative access to ad to the entire helpdesk 
 as you can well expect our <unk> and carefully maintained ad structure now had <unk> group policies login scripts which went nowhere and more <unk> accounts and objects than i think we would ever finally sort out 
 it was if angie had left me a parting gift a final <unk> you” from the queen of <unk> 
 it’s <unk> effect seemed <unk> given her ineptitude 
 but it had <unk> on every single user in the company as their login times grew <unk> together with seemingly random permission sets which denied sometimes even the most basic of privileges 
 it was getting to be the <unk> summer i’ve ever known in britain 
 i still hadn’t taken time out to wash my <unk> it’s recent costly repair bill had left a bitter taste in my mouth 
 the grime that lay <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> seemed an <unk> punishment for <unk> me of yet another wage check 
 arriving back to the office from a <unk> summer pub lunch i walked towards the building across the car park 
 as i passed a familiar jaguar <unk> a <unk> spot in the car park 
 sleek and shiny its black finish shone in the midday sun freshly polished and lovingly detailed 
 its <unk> seemed <unk> by the fact that angie had once owned a car like this her angry face refusing to even make eye contact as she stared over the leather steering wheel 
 i had finished replacing a dead hard disk in an optiplex and was delivering it to a damsel in distress 
 particularly this was one of the sales guys <unk> in distress 
 as i connected the machine back up he came out of his <unk> office for a chat 
 <unk> you see your ex manager is <unk> he <unk> 
 i knew what he meant this man had been trained to smile and lie for a living 
 the news that angie was back seemed <unk> 
 <unk> angie ” i questioned 
 <unk> got sacked didn’t she ” the sales manager shook his head with a learned look 
 <unk> like that don’t get sacked ” he explained 
 i hung on his every word as if this was the most important lesson i would ever receiving in my life 
 “when someone like that is put into a particular position it’s usually because someone recommended her for it 
 someone put her there jon6 
 if she had done well the person who recommended her would have gotten a nice pat on the back 
 but if she <unk> it up there’s no way they’re going to turf her out 
 whoever recommended her would have their nuts in a <unk> for recommending such a <unk> nobody would ever take them seriously ever <unk> he continued “when people like that in such positions of power make a fantastic fuck up like that they get paid off 
 they get promoted with a golden handshake just so someone above her can save face with the board 
 admitting failure isn’t even on the menu ” <unk> the obvious truth to his words i had to probe deeper <unk> who got the blame for all that then ” “well bhit of course 
 he was so close to retirement and he didn’t really make much noise anyway 
 people forgot he was there 
 it was either him or you guys really ” i looked up from over the desk partition 
 across the <unk> office i could just about see the familiar twisted frame of angie as she stormed with intent around a small section of desks her shrill and piercing tone somehow breaking through the human noise over the sound of printers phones and chatter 
 another hapless team of underlings were getting it from her both <unk> 
 i turned eager to continue this discourse however the sales manager had already retreated to his office 
 he held his phone to his head as he clicked the door closed 
 as the optiplex spun into life the windows xp splash screen <unk> as if to stand testament to the <unk> 
 who had really won here 
 well nobody it seems 
 as i struggled to think for a moral to the story i was interrupted by the returning damsel 
 she thanked me for my time turning back to her work our brief moment of temporary friendship now at an end <unk> and <unk> <unk> with the completion of my task the only remaining duty being the closing of the support ticket

 i 'm doing short engagement at a large distributor 
 a part of the job is to figure out all the important data <unk> 
 a core system accepts orders as some form of <unk> and sucks it up into a massive sql database 
 other processes then pull out orders by manufacturer supplier or warehouse to place orders or ship products 
 it 's an order <unk> and a day 's downtime would be very very expensive 
 like hundreds of millions of dollars expensive 
 this engagement is n't really a security exercise 
 i 'm involved since there 's a gap of a few days in my schedule and i 'm pretty good at the interviewing and writing stuff 
 but i ca n't look at anything without contemplating how to break it 
 i 'm interviewing a systems <unk> to understand how this monster works 
 me : '' so i 'm an end user and i want to place an order for 10 units of $ product 
 walk me through the process '' sa : '' an individual location either uses our application or generates their own csv 
 it gets sent to us through the application or an alternate method '' me : '' how does the application do it '' 
 sa : '' me : '' and the alternate methods '' 
 sa : '' they can email to a special email address or use sftp 
 the internal apps and database have no route to the outside world so we 're pretty well <unk> off '' 
 me : '' and once it 's in your system what happens '' 
 sa : '' it 's dropped to a folder 
 a script watches it and it 's <unk> using sql '' me : '' what kind of filtering or <unk> do you use '' 
 sa : '' uh none 
 if it 's not compatible the scripts <unk> it and generate an exception '' me : '' so no <unk> for control characters '' 
 sa : '' no '' 
 me : '' what about spam to that email address '' 
 sa : '' if it 's not a csv the script rejects it 
 the email address is n't obvious 
 why are you so interested '' 
 me : '' well this is a critical system right '' 
 sa chuckling : '' oh yeah '' me : '' and what if i place or email an order for fifty units of <unk> <unk> 
 sa : looking at me blankly : '' uh 
 hmmm 
 who would 
 hmmm 
 yeah 
 shit '' 
 me : '' you see where i 'm going right '' 
 sa : '' ok. now i have to figure out how to fix it and get it through change control '' me : '' well how many products do you have that have <unk> in the product name '' 
 sa : '' not bad '' 
 me : '' i 'm all about the value add '' hello again tfts 
 now that my laughing and crying has stopped i figured i would share the tale of the last call i had this morning 
 end user informed me that he was trying to install windows 7 on his personal computer 
 after informing him we do not support personal computers i decided i would be nice and give a little advice ... that 's when the details of his problem came out 
 & gt kupholder : thank you for calling employer how can i help you today 
 & gt eu : yeah i am trying to install windows 7 on my computer but i keep getting errors while trying to activate 
 & gt kupholder : sadly we do not support personal computers but if you do n't mind me asking what is the error you are getting 
 & gt eu : it says that my product key is not valid and that i may be a <unk> of software <unk> 
 i purchased this key myself 
 i called microsoft and they informed me that this key is blacklisted and that i need to buy another key 
 however they do not sell windows 7 keys anymore 
 only windows 8 
 & gt kupholder : where did you purchase your product key 
 you will need to contact them if microsoft says the key is blacklisted ... & gt eu : well i purchased from a site called <unk> but they never sent a key so i purchased one from <unk> and they e-mailed me a product key 
 now both of those sites do n't appear to exist ... & gt kupholder : ok you first will want to reach out to your bank and get a new card because those sites are not valid sites to purchase anything <unk> if you still want windows 7 you should go to like a local <unk> or <unk> i strongly advise you to never purchase anything like this again without verifying that the site is a valid <unk> ... & gt eu : ok thanks i will do that 
 goodbye 
 the laughing and crying was so hard my chest hurts ... this is why <unk> is such a <unk> field i 've been working at my particular campus for going on four years now and never had anything truly entertaining to report 
 i 've had plenty of clueless end-users and unbelievably disgusting problems to address but never anything i considered worthy of reporting on this subreddit - until today 
 for the past month one particular departmental supervisor $ sup has been complaining about one specific staff computer 
 the problem was not catastrophic and staff were still able to work so it was very far down on our list of things to address 
 the emails sent were as follows : & gt $ sup : hi guys either there is a ghost living in our staff computer or some wires may be crossed somewhere : 
 staff reported to me last night that the <unk> beeping on the computer is causing numbers to pop up on the screen 
 thoughts 
 the regular troubleshooting methods were applied and the staff members were unable to reproduce the problem so we the it staff <unk> it up to user error and moved on with our lives 
 although the problem seemed to <unk> up at random points and the ghost of the staff computer '' became a running joke 
 after a few more phone calls that led nowhere today i received the following email : & gt $ sup : it appears the ghost is still living in the staff computer 
 yesterday afternoon the computer was beeping for quite some time 
 every time it would beep the numbers <unk> would show up on the screen 
 i 'm hoping this can be solved and is not actually a secret message code we 're supposed to translate ... finally my director $ dir comes into my office : & gt $ dir : can you at least go <unk> at the computer 
 this problem just is n't going away 
 & gt $ me : sure no problem 
 & gt $ dir : i 'm sure it 's nothing but let me know if you find anything 
 i go look and it takes me two seconds to identify the problem 
 an amazingly old legacy barcode scanner long and forgotten was crammed back into the corner behind the desk 
 this old scanner used to be used to scan in <unk> numbers but has long since been made obsolete by electronic rx <unk> 
 it was <unk> in just a way that it was occasionally scanning the serial number barcode on the back of the monitor 
 proof solution : unplugged the scanner 
 miraculously the problem went away 
 i was disappointed that i did n't get to perform an exorcism but i suppose i can take solace in knowing that the ghost in the computer '' jokes will stop 
 i used to work at an ad agency <unk> here 
 the agency was in your typical <unk> office park 
 next park over was the emergency operations center for our local electricity utility 
 ironically the office park had unreliable power which is why we had ups at almost every workstation 
 one morning i know we 're going to have a bad power day when i can hear <unk> coming into and out of the operations center 
 the sysadmin 's not at work yet so i 'm bouncing between powering down servers in a controlled manner and explaining to users that i know your ups is <unk> it 's singing the song of its people '' 
 our phone switch goes down hard since we have n't refreshed the ups battery 
 we had diverted the funds to purchase the latest <unk> for the senior staff 
 one particularly <unk> junior account executive calls me over to her cube 
 her : '' when are we going to have power back - i have a very important call at 10am '' me : '' i really do n't know 
 i 'd recommend making the call on your cell phone '' her : '' this is n't acceptable 
 we pay you and you ca n't even keep the lights on '' me pointing out the window to the operations center : '' they 're clearly scrambling over there at $ <unk> 
 five minutes after power comes back the phones will be working '' 
 her : '' stop making excuses '' 
 me : '' ok. does it look like i have a hard hat '' 
 her : '' it 's just technology make it work '' 
 actually her comment inspired me 
 i went to the art department pulled a recently refreshed heavy duty ups attached to a workstation ... and connected it to the coffee maker 
 this happened a few months ago 
 i wrote and support a <unk> audit system 
 so all the users are doctors 
 one part of the system lets them up load documents or pictures <unk> <unk> doc <unk> pdf and jpg 
 so i get a call from an irate surgeon who is complaining that he desperately needs to upload some images but the system wo n't let him 
 i take a quick look and see that he 's trying to upload <unk> files bmp and not <unk> jpg 
 & gt ah 
 i said 
 i can see the problem 
 you need to save your files as jpg and not bmp then the system will take them 
 an oversight on our part 
 i did n't think that people would want to use bmp files so did n't cater for it 
 i 'll write a fix and upload it during the next maintenance update surgeon thanks me and i closed the call 
 30 minutes later phone rang 
 & gt i 've changed them all to jpg files and <unk> them but the wo n't display 
 fix this shit 
 so i logged onto the database and took a look 
 yup 
 there was <unk> data in the <unk> 
 the file extensions were jpg the tags and filenames look ok. but they would n't display 
 then i looked closer at the <unk> 
 specifically at the first 2 bytes 
 they were <unk> 
 i rang surgeon back and asked how he 'd gotten the files into .jpg format 
 & gt oh i just right clicked on the files and <unk> the extension from <unk> to .jpg <unk> & gt it does n't work that way 
 to put it into medical terms that 's like grabbing a bottle of viagra crossing out viagra and writing <unk> on the bottle and expecting it to relieve pain 
 it wo n't work 
 all you 'll get is a patient in pain with a <unk> 
 then i told him how to open the files in paint save as jpg and upload them 
 problem solved 
 previous & gt defiant : i want do a ticket by myself 
 & gt me : you’ve done a few by yourself already 
 & gt defiant : no i mean 100 % by myself 
 defiant looked at the ticket queue to select his ticket 
 i was happy he was so keen on working 
 i went to get coffee 
 ***** a ten minutes later i walked back into the office 
 defiant was sitting back in his chair happily 
 & gt defiant : i’ve already finished three tickets 
 & gt me : oh… i was surprised he’d completed them so quickly 
 i thought he was just selecting which ones he wanted to do 
 & gt defiant : i’ve done a password reset 
 defiant clicked on the email 
 the reply was very short 
 <unk> - here is your new password * $ @ <unk> 
 please change it asap 
 —it 
 & gt me : how… efficient 
 i made a mental note to send actual instructions on changing your password to that user 
 defiant happily clicked on the second ticket he’d completed 
 <unk> - *i recently got a new screen 
 can i trade it in and get a white bordered screen 
 or could you paint my screens border white 
 black is very distracting 
 * - the vp 
 <unk> email** - <unk> being stupid 
 black is fine its a border 
 * —it 
 & gt me : errr… 
 & gt defiant : right 
 how stupid is he 
 thinking we’d paint a screen 
 my face drained of colour 
 & gt me : defiant… who… do you think the vp is 
 & gt defiant : does it matter 
 a silly request is a silly request 
 the phone on my desk started to ring 
 & gt me : oh perfect ... i picked up the phone 
 & gt vp : what the hell is going **on** in it airz 
 & gt me : err… 
 apologies 
 i think a mistake has been made 
 the vp was furious 
 defiant sat smugly in my chair oblivious 
 & gt vp : i sent a ticket to get rid of these black bordered screens and what do i get in return 
 & gt me : ... defiant had worked out who i was talking to and sat shocked 
 & gt defiant : what are you doing 
 that was the dumbest ticket i’ve ever seen & gt me : defiant… <unk> quiet 
 okay 
 & gt vp : the <unk> most <unk> reply i’ve ever gotten 
 i only asked if a white screen was possible and suddenly i’m getting insulted 
 & gt me : vp 
 apologies 
 it has been having some problems 
 my mind went into overdrive to find a solution 
 with a sip of coffee i found only one 
 lie 
 & gt me : the email client has been causing problems 
 it’s scrambling some of emails 
 we’ll sort it 
 & gt vp : scrambling emails 
 i didn’t feel good lying 
 everything i said sounded fake 
 & gt me : it <unk> words with the <unk> 
 and stuff 
 & gt vp : oh i see 
 & gt me : the email that got <unk> said “you’re so right white is good we’ll sort it '' 
 & gt vp : so i’m getting a white monitor 
 i agreed and quickly hung up the phone 
 & gt me : defiant 
 find some white paint 
 you’ve got some painting to do 
 ***** at that point time i forgot to check that third email 
 probably not important though 
 next just had another house moment : everybody lies '' 
 this reminded me of my first <unk> as a pfy working helpdesk 
 i was making a coffee when account manager snoozy he fell asleep at a company event cornered me 
 & gt **snoozy : ** hey fb my computer is making a ticking sound 
 can you have a look at it '' 
 & gt **me : ** oh dear 
 i am off to a meeting 
 raise a ticket and someone will check it out '' 
 & gt **snoozy : ** uh 
 ok. '' a couple of days later i am in reception * the receptionist was cute * and i get a <unk> from snoozy : & gt **snoozy : ** hey fb 
 it 's still ticking '' 
 & gt **me : ** hey snoozy 
 raised a ticket yet '' 
 & gt **snoozy : ** oh yeah 
 forgot 
 will do '' 
 *** so weeks later i get called into boss 's office and snoozy is there 
 both seem cross 
 & gt **boss : ** now fb 
 snoozy has been greatly <unk> by a hard disk failure that you were supposed to sort out weeks ago '' 
 & gt **me : ** did he raise a helpdesk ticket 
 i asked him to raise a ticket twice 
 i never saw one '' 
 & gt **snoozy : ** * <unk> * i spoke to you twice about it and i was under the impression that you were going to look at it '' 
 the <unk> look they were both giving me was : what do you have to say about that '' 
 & gt **me : ** i can be honest or polite 
 unfortunately this situation prevents me from being both '' 
 the nod and smile from boss told me i could leave the room 
 *** <unk> <unk> *** **edit : ** thanks to <unk> for this idea : & lt desktop & gt **edit : ** thanks to <unk> for doing it in the correct font : & lt desktop & gt a couple weeks ago i told you guys about how you just ca n't save some people today i received much better news 
 i have a long standing policy with people 
 if you really want to learn networking and you 've shown to me that you really want to learn this trade i will make it my mission to help 
 i will provide the hardware for you to learn on 
 when you have racks like this at home you do n't really miss an extra router or switch not only that i will loan you books from my own library to use 
 i will work up <unk> for you to complete 
 i will do what i can to help you learn but you have to be willing to do so 
 about two years ago i had a guy that worked help desk for one of my customers that was extremely interested in what i do 
 whenever i was onsite he 'd follow me around like a <unk> asking questions 
 after a while i asked him why he did n't just get a ccna or something and start doing networking 
 he obviously had the drive to do it ... he told me that his wife was <unk> and stayed home with their <unk> son 
 he just did n't have the extra money to <unk> to hardware or training 
 if there was ever a situation where my policy fit this was it 
 the next time i went onsite i brought a cisco <unk> and a <unk> switch with me 
 i handed him the gear and explained my policy to him 
 i would help him get certified 
 i called my buddy jeremy and got him a full course of computer based training to get his ccna 
 he had full access to my library of books 
 on a thumb drive i had copies of all kinds of routing and switching books which i gave him 
 i moved off that contract not long after this but me and the guy kept in touch 
 i sent him <unk> every other week for him to do 
 i designed labs for him 
 i even shipped him a router that i had intentionally screwed up and told him only to fix it '' starting with logging into it since i did n't give him the passwords 
 for about a year this went on until he stopped responding to emails 
 i thought that i had lost yet another one ... until this morning 
 i received this text from the guy this morning 
 & gt *i just wanted to say thanks 
 i started my new job at & lt - company - & gt yesterday as a network engineer making $ 20k more than before 
 i have you to thank for that 
 what is your mailing address 
 i would like to send you a check for your time and to thank you for everything 
 you have changed my family 's life 
 * rather than text back i just called him 
 he stopped replying to the emails because he felt bad about leaning on me to learn 
 he felt he had a good start and wanted to continue on his own so he did 
 and he did get certified 
 he got his ccna and <unk> 
 for christmas i sent him two <unk> for cisco tests even though we had n't spoken in a few months 
 he used those two <unk> back in march and got certified 
 and yesterday he started his new career in networking at a very large bank 
 it 's an entry level job but his total package including benefits is worth over $ 20k more than his previous job 
 it also has excellent insurance that 's going to help his son 
 i could hear in his voice that he was nearly in tears on the phone 
 i told him to not worry about sending me anything seeing him <unk> was payment enough for me and at that point he was in tears 
 now contrary to what you might think i did n't post this to <unk> my own <unk> or to pat myself on the back 
 i posted it because there 's a lot of us in this sub that have a lot of expertise in what we do 
 we are the masters of the universe because if we all decided to quit our jobs tomorrow the world would n't be able to function 
 who is the assistant marketing director going to call when she opens that .exe file she received from an unknown email address 
 how else will the cfo get his new surface tablet connected to the vpn 
 i think all of the senior folks here need to have a similar policy to mine 
 i issue this challenge : if someone shows you a real interest in what you do especially if that person is young and willing to learn make it your mission to help them in any way you can 
 many of the things that we look at as common knowledge '' probably look like <unk> science to people that do n't do it everyday 
 even something like teaching <unk> conversion and <unk> to someone can open a whole new world to them 
 you 're going to fail pretty often 
 of the 13 different people that i 've tried to help and provided hardware to only 5 of them have gotten a certification and two of those people never put that cert to use 
 although one is now an artist at <unk> and is amazing ... let 's even try to teach users about what we do 
 i 'm not saying that the cfo needs to know what a type 7 <unk> is but he should probably understand why plugging that little netgear switch he picked up online into the wall twice wo n't give him twice the speed and will probably break something in the process 
 well not if you actually configured <unk> tree correctly the first time 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - i 'm getting a lot of pm 's about where people should start if they want to get into networking or which books i suggest for getting your ccna 
 start with cisco press books for your ccna 
 if you want to learn juniper and i kid you not the <unk> for <unk> book is invaluable 
 i have a hard copy close as well as pdfs of my phone ipad and laptop for quick reference 
 for cisco here 's some <unk> to keep an eye out for 
 they are all excellent 
 <unk> <unk> jeremy cioara <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> william <unk> if you want to computer based training jeremy cioara 's <unk> <unk> series is awesome 
 he has a great voice and is very excited about what he does so it makes learning easier 
 not only that but if you work for a company that is a cisco partner there 's a metric <unk> of free training on the partner portal 
 for juniper simply go to <unk> and you can take a free network <unk> <unk> 
 if you pass the <unk> exam on juniper 's site you get a 50 % discount voucher for your certification exam 
 network companies want you certified and they will provide many different ways for you to learn the trade 
 and just remember if does n't matter if you learn cisco juniper hp <unk> extreme networks or whatever 
 routing and switching works the same on all hardware the only difference is the command line syntax and their own proprietary protocols i 'm looking at you cisco ... 
 <unk> has tons of good resources too 
 tools config tips cheat <unk> these are invaluable <unk> notes you name it 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- guys please do n't give me gold for this post 
 if you 're feeling the urge to give something might i suggest giving to wikipedia 
 face it the wiki has saved all of our asses at one time or another 
 if you do n't like wikipedia try the electronic <unk> <unk> child 's play a great <unk> that gives games to sick kids in hospitals first or the <unk> society for every month of gold $ 4 you <unk> to one of those <unk> i 'll match it 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- more pm 's answered and more questions asked 
 many people want advice on getting into networking so i 've made a new post to address those questions 
 the building manager was a <unk> man he <unk> about the building occasionally fixing problems and generally keeping out of the way therefore it was some surprise to me that i found myself facing the <unk> mass 
 & gt buildmang : the ... lifts ... he tried to puff out an entire sentence but failed 
 the building manager slumped into the seat opposite mine and <unk> for air 
 i was mildly concerned for his health 
 & gt me : the lifts aren’t working 
 & gt buildmang : yes ... the sound of his <unk> battling for air continued for a few moments 
 having nothing to say to the man i worked around him 
 after around ten minutes of silent reflection and <unk> by the giant he finally decided to attempt speaking 
 & gt buildmang : you’ve heard nothing from the vp recently 
 & gt me : the vp 
 goodness no 
 the building manager seemed <unk> i wondered if the vp actually had a friend 
 i quickly discarded the thought it was too weird 
 & gt buildmang : you’re in management right 
 & gt me : head of it 
 so ... & gt buildmang : and head of security 
 & gt me : not anymore 
 luckily 
 the nightmares of my time in security had finally started to fade 
 i realized how out of the loop the building manager truely was 
 & gt buildmang : definitely high management though 
 to command two different departments 
 so i was wondering did the vp even mention to you our arrangement 
 & gt me : no ... & gt buildmang : well errr ... not to put too fine a point on it but the lifts don’t run themselves 
 the building manager <unk> <unk> on about all the things in the building that didn’t <unk> <unk> 
 oddly he kept mentioning things like automatic doors and elevators which i had always assumed did run themselves 
 & gt me : ahh and it’s your job to keep these services running 
 & gt buildmang : indeed 
 the pause <unk> out to eternity 
 i looked down at the bumbling man with confusion 
 i couldn’t tell if he was looking for his regular pay or a bit extra 
 the word bribe spun round in my mind 
 & gt me : well if you’d like to head up to accounting ... & gt buildmang : i was thinking more cash 
 those accountants love books a little too much 
 a bribe it was 
 & gt me : i think you’re in the wrong department for that kind of thing 
 perhaps go up to the executive level someone will point you in the right direction 
 i could feel my wallet thanking me from my pocket 
 & gt buildmang : mmm yes but that would take time 
 looking around here at all these heavy computers i can’t help but think it would be a liability not to just sort this out now 
 & gt me : so you’re saying the lifts won’t work till i ... sort *this* out 
 & gt buildmang : the repair of the lifts could take anywhere from a few minutes to weeks 
 having never been asked for such a blatant bribe before i didn’t know the protocol 
 naturally i just stared him down like a bull 
 i silently waited for him to leave 
 he eventually <unk> himself off the chair and ambled to the door 
 & gt buildmang : just trying to speed things up 
 building manager was right carrying computers up <unk> is dangerous 
 opening up my email i decided to send a quick message company wide 
 & gt due to lack of lifts it can no longer move computers between floors 
 all it work will either be fixed on site or postponed until such a time ... i sat back in my chair and wondered who else the vp had agreements <unk> as engineer for a large manufacturing group 
 i discovered the server that controlled all automated sheet metal fabrication <unk> was a stand alone island network and <unk> that fell outside of our secured data center 
 upon asking about this they informed me that the <unk> operators were confident they could handle the responsibility of maintaining this island network of sheet metal computerized machines and the server 
 surprisingly they went years without any issues that affected their production 
 one day they needed a bit of help so i came in 
 never before had i actually seen where this server was 
 under the billing secretary 's desk 
 she said it put off so much heat it kept her warm in their some what <unk> shop office 
 it was connected via a cheap <unk> <unk> along with the most stable of electronics : a space heater and the shop microwave 
 the dell <unk> server was throwing a raid drive fault light 
 i see the audible alarm has been disabled '' i tried to get a response out of the few people watching me look at this dusty <unk> 
 secretary - oh yeah 
 it started beeping and would n't stop '' did you not think to bring that to someone 's attention 
 how long was it doing that '' 
 secretary - since october '' so about a month '' of 2012 '' this server has been beeping at you for two years '' yep '' and this was no cause for concern '' <unk> with all due respect ma'am 
 you 're an idiot '' a very old tale from when i provided in-house it at a <unk> headquarters 
 it was my first job over a decade ago 
 it was an incredibly wasteful place previously featured a few times 
 1 - 2 - 3 at one point we needed to purchase some licenses from microsoft for a few different pieces of software 
 my orders were to purchase a total of over 2000 licenses which seemed fine given that some of them would be used outside headquarters 
 until i looked at the specifics at the request 
 my boss boss had decided to order tons of copies of nearly everything in their catalog - including licenses for an old os we were almost done <unk> out along with the new one and things as <unk> as ms works - along with ms word 
 at a glance i could tell half of these would never be used but he had clearly opted for some sort of package deal 
 when tacking on the costs of premium support the final tally was one of the largest bills i ever signed up for 
 the exact specifics of the package direction wanted had been pointed out to me so really i was just handing down an order but still 
 i thought this concluded the business 
 after all the software we actually needed to use was already part of the win2k ghosts i used all day long as part of the ongoing migration 
 we were n't actually purchasing new products just the rights to use copies we already had and were in the process of updating 
 and several hundred <unk> to cover for future <unk> 
 sometimes later i get a call from my lovely friend at reception 
 & gt emily : bytewave your crates just arrived do i let the delivery people in or you 'll pick them up here '' 
 crates 
 wat 
 & gt bytewave : i do n't believe i 'm expecting a <unk> <unk> '' 
 & gt emily : from microsoft 
 your name is on the order '' 
 i hurry over with an industrial trolley 
 i sign the paperwork and bring them back to the depths of it 's lair 
 the shock when i opened them 
 one was filled with endless copies of <unk> explaining the features of each product we had bought 
 tons and tons of fliers explaining what you can do with <unk> 
 powerpoint 
 basic 
 yeah i have a use for that 
 thankfully at least it was n't one <unk> per license 
 then the cd crates 
 for each license or nearly so by my <unk> we were provided with a hard copy 
 okay it 's the early 00 's which makes it slightly more <unk> than it would be nowadays but i 'm still dumbfounded 
 and they 're not in cd cases but in thick <unk> where they are directly <unk> on top of each other in bulk 
 i looked again at the invoice to make sure i did n't make any mistakes and order hard copies instead of licenses 
 sure enough in the breakdown of the costs there 's a scary line providing for <unk> media costs but it 's really part of the package i was specifically told to get 
 i figure its an oversight as we have no use for all that stuff - hell i 'm not sure where we 're going to store it 
 i tell my boss who quickly runs it up to see if it was unintended 
 i 'm still assuming i 'll be told to ship that back so i 'm not sweating too much just yet 
 my hopes were quickly <unk> 
 & gt first boss : i 'm afraid it was n't unintended 
 they did n't know we 'd get this many but they wanted them just in case 
 we 're keeping them '' 
 & gt bytewave : ... where the hell am i supposed to store this '' 
 we 're on a high floor of the <unk> with the most expensive square foot in the city there are n't that many available corners to stash crates in 
 corners are generally occupied by tons of overpriced printers 
 even the server room is getting pretty crowded it 's really the only place out of sight i have to store stuff beyond the maintenance closet 
 there 's the <unk> room but the lady in charge would kill me if i littered there 
 it had to be <unk> at all times after all important people need paper too sometimes ... & gt first boss : well not <unk> you can take them to the tape backup location 
 and take a dozen or so of each we could actually use and put them in a cd binder would you 
 stash that in the server room 
 oh and while you 're at it bring the tape backups '' 
 and here i am soon after a pfy with a big industrial trolley and heavy crates of utterly useless junk nobody will ever use being slowly pushed through elevators and <unk> and carried by company truck to a set of empty offices above a noisy printing floor 
 i tucked it all in a corner where it 's probably still collecting dust to this day 
 i had a lovely afternoon there digging in these to find the potentially useful disks and slowly filing them into a couple <unk> 
 the win2k ones were ultimately buried at the very bottom under a thick stack of windows me disks 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 i just went into a meeting and happened to be sitting next to the help desk guy who had the <unk> of taking the ticket 
 user reports that she had a <unk> in her office and now she is unable to connect to the network 
 she would like a tech to take a look at her pc to make sure everything is ok with the wires on the back of her pc '' 
 made my friday so much <unk> took place a while ago when i lived in sydney with my gramps he was on holidays with my aunt in brisbane i worked in hospitality and it was an exceptionally busy friday night where i had been non stop serving booze and fixing <unk> slot machines for a few hours now when i get a slight chance to check my phone i noticed my gramps had been calling me non stop for the past 10 minutes and texts me asking to call him as it 's an emergency 
 my old workplace was quite strict on phones you were n't supposed to have your phone on you and you definitely were not supposed to be calling someone mid shift 
 so i tell one of the managers that i need to call him as it was urgent i know i 'm already in trouble as they will <unk> me out for having my phone on me when i get back but he frowns and continues serving people at the bar 
 i rush downstairs and call my gramps at this point i should probably mention that brisbane is roughly <unk> <unk> from sydney 
 **the call : ** **me : ** hello 
 what 's wrong 
 i 'm at work 
 **gramps : ** <unk> tell me what is the wifi password 
 **me : ** ... what 
 **gramps : ** the wifi password quickly tell me what it is i bought a laptop and i need to check my emails **at this point i 'm pissed that he got me in trouble as it certainly was n't an emergency 
 ** **me : ** oh so you 're home 
 that was early 
 **gramps : ** no no i 'm still in brisbane 
 **me : ** <unk> 
 **gramps : ** just tell me the bloody wifi password i 'm in a rush 
 **me : ** so you want the home wifi password 
 **gramps : ** yes 
 **me : ** while you 're in brisbane 
 **gramps : ** yes 
 jesus what is so hard to understand 
 i simply hung up on him and dragged myself upstairs awaiting to be chewed out by the manager for having my phone on me and leaving at the busiest time to make a call 
 my gramps is the least computer <unk> person i have ever come across he is a <unk> for <unk> work as an internal tech support we deal with our office user’s problems and engineers in the field 
 i 'd just made my first coffee of the working day around <unk> when i get a call from $ engineer : & gt $ beefytowers : good morning $ beefytowers speaking 
 & gt $ engineer : oh hi there $ beefytowers : i 've got a problem 
 & gt $ beefytowers : how can i help 
 & gt $ engineer : well it 's this pda in my old age i’m not getting very good with these things 
 i start to prepare for the inevitable i ca n't see the screen how do i turn it on my emails wo n't sync ... & gt $ engineer : well my pda wo n't turn on 
 & gt $ beefytowers : have you charged it up 
 & gt $ engineer : well you see i got up this morning made myself a coffee ... i was n't prepared for a 10 minute <unk> of $ engineers morning routine 
 i glazed over waiting for him to get the bit i need to know 
 & gt $ engineer : ... and i got it out of the microwave and it was n't my porridge ... & gt $ beefytowers : sorry can you repeat that last part 
 & gt $ engineer : well i <unk> my pda 
 i think i need to retire but my wife wo n't let me 
 & gt $ beefytowers : <unk> 
 ** & gt $ engineer : it was only in for a few seconds 
 as you 'd presume i was not expecting this 
 & gt $ beefytowers : urm well wow 
 if at all possible can i have the sim number and asset number 
 & gt $ engineer : well it’s a bit <unk> now give me a minute 
 <unk> sounds of what i presume was a variety of kitchen tools <unk> apart the pda to get to the now buried sim and asset sticker 
 * & gt $ engineer : i found it <unk> it’s a bit lumpy do you still want the number 
 & gt $ beefytowers : yeah i need it so i can transfer your number to this sim 
 & gt $ engineer : okay <unk> 
 please do n't tell <unk> about this 
 & gt $ beefytowers : do n't worry i wo n't report this to your line manager 
 i 'll have a new pda set up and sent out for tomorrow 
 & gt $ engineer : thanks ever so much 
 bye 
 i set up and sent out a new pda with a <unk> not <unk> <unk> note 
 a few days later i got the <unk> pda and it was definitely lumpy some might even say it was like set porridge 
 tl dr : pda 's dont microwave 
 some years ago i found myself on the roof of our building at work early in the evening 
 technically i 'm on the clock but it 's a quiet night at my telco and there 's a blood moon event so some of us decided to just go up there and have a slightly extended union break stargazing 
 after bypassing a locked door with an override security card we 're not really supposed to have i see the roof for the first time 
 great view 
 but we notice the <unk> thing in a corner 
 a <unk> <unk> and a receiver dish facing each other with just a few inches in-between in a <unk> casing to protect them from the weather and eliminate interference with hardened cables connected to each going back in the building on both ends 
 i ca n't fathom a reason for this contraption 
 in theory that 's utterly useless a simple cable would do the same thing and we 're a cable telco 
 we chat about it and are all a bit curious but we do n't have an answer so we just relax and do some <unk> as originally planned 
 next day i look at the building plans - it 's all there in detail for anyone to see amongst the fire drill documents 
 the contraption is documented and it 's actually broadcasting and receiving inches away over the air '' a couple qams which i look up and notice are reserved for public channels including <unk> 
 i go downstairs to the office of the tv product director to get the skinny 
 i skip the part about the stargazing on the clock and tell him i saw this on the plans wondering if he has an explanation 
 & gt tvpd : oh yeah that 
 we only get the full <unk> for broadcasting certain public channels if we do so over the air rather than strictly through a cable network 
 the rules were written by the <unk> at a time most <unk> did n't have cable and they were never updated 
 once we stopped doing real ota here and at every headend we installed a setup like this where we are *technically* broadcasting a couple qams ota and feeding it back inside to the cable network to stay in <unk> compliance '' 
 ... moment of silence while i process this 
 & gt bytewave : that 's <unk> beautiful genius cheating 
 given how arcane these rules are perfectly appropriate 
 it 's also a great story i 'll let the rest of senior staff know about this '' 
 i walk away not sure if i should be stunned or vaguely in awe 
 probably both 
 for clarity the genius part is that after being ota for a <unk> the feed the receiver gets goes on to become the source feed we <unk> for these channels 
 so it 's not a matter of being able to pretend we 're sending *something* over the air but very much that any of our customers watching these channels is actually receiving a feed that was briefly ota 
 that 's what made this <unk> solution <unk> 
 after all there 's nothing that says for *how <unk> the signal has to be ota 
 there 's also nothing that required these dishes to be on the roof at other headends they are all inside but at my work location there was a set outside that could be easily <unk> on the roof with minimal trouble 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 hi may be not exactly support story but related 
 about 6 or 7 years ago i was searching for a new job 
 i was somewhat experienced or so i thought at the time caring for a small ad forest and <unk> based web-hosting for 2 years prior 
 it was december relatively dry time of the year for job hunting so one of the positions left on the local market to choose from was in helpdesk support for some it outsourcing company 
 they claimed that they are very big successful and popular company but i 've never heard about them neither before nor after that 
 during the interview there was an hr lady in the room and head of it <unk> 
 hr asked questions first pretty generic ones like : '' why do want to work here 
 nothing interesting 
 so finally it was time for technical part of the interview <unk> asked some easy technical questions at first but then : & gt **hoit** : please name 3 network protocols from microsoft without which windows xp based network can not function 
 & gt **me** : <unk> is he talking about.. i can name a few protocols developed by ms but none of them are critical for network to work at least without any conditions mentioned to be necessary 
 * & gt **me** : well ... i guess <unk> <unk> even though it 's not from ms and.. i do n't know nothing else related comes to mind and even those are n't really critical for the network 
 & gt **hoit** : sorry but this is an incorrect answer 
 & gt **me** : ok can you give me a correct one 
 & gt **hoit** : sure the answer is : dhcp dns and <unk> & gt **me** : what 
 first of all none of those are developed or belong to ms and second none are required for windows network to function with only slight exception of dns needed for ad to function properly 
 your answer for your own question is completely wrong 
 & gt **hoit** : well ... you are correct but i wanted to hear from you the answer i gave 
 & gt **me** : how am i supposed to correctly guess which incorrect answer to the question you are thinking of 
 & gt **hoit** : yeah <unk> that will be all for today we will send you an e-mail with our decision regarding you 
 about a week later i received an e-mail explaining that my application was declined reason : <unk> 
 **tl dr** : you are correct but i am right 
 credit : <unk> this is one of the more interesting ones around i have witnessed 
 hope you enjoy 
 cast : $ cl = cheery elderly lady that was my intelligent bar client $ <unk> = hardware guy $ me = yours truly & gt $ cl hi 
 how are you 
 & gt $ me fine your self 
 & gt $ cl better if this piece of sh t worked for once & gt $ me well lets see what i can do first whats the problem 
 & gt $ <unk> my grandson was using my mac and now when ever i try turning it on it makes a loud noise and does n't work 
 crap 
 <unk> 
 & gt $ me well lets see this tomfoolery <unk> a <unk> white macbook on the table 
 yep it was screeching for its life 
 also this macbook felt oddly lighter ... & gt $ me uh mam there is n't a battery in this mac 
 & gt $ cl yeah my grandson said that i do n't need it 
 double crap modified 
 i also went to check that there were ram in the slots 
 none 
 hard drive 
 nothing 
 & gt $ me mam there is no ram or hard drive you ca n't use your computer without that 
 & gt $ cl my grandson said i do n't need those either 
 tl dr : grandson thinks he knows everything 
 grandson has to pay her for a new <unk> time readers may remember this old tale where <unk> honest guy was let go ohg had explained in great detail one of my telco 's controversial policies it 's still active today 
 if you have a problem that requires a service call you 'll likely first be serviced twice by a smelly road tech contractor paid by call 
 they <unk> get it done but if your problem is n't obvious and we need to go to your place for a third time we kick into high gear 
 this is what ohg referred to as <unk> a good technician 
 your issue is escalated to senior staff we review your history look at logs of your devices and your node and set up an <unk> service call with recommendations sent to union road techs escalation for review 
 then you get union techs from select crack teams sent your way with solid documentation 
 these guys the best we got and will happily work all day to make sure everything is just perfect - hourly wages 
 furthermore when we send out a 'good technician out a network tech goes along in case anything <unk> is causing part of the issue 
 there is one <unk> 
 because of the chain of escalation the required analysis the fact two escalation teams have to be involved and <unk> people for the job it takes time to set up 
 also deep in the <unk> we do n't always have union people at hand 
 sometimes your 'good technician will be driving for hours to get to your place 
 so we need a <unk> hour delay for these something that some unhappy customers find hard to swallow as we can normally get someone to their place quicker sometimes at 3 hours notice 
 i wrote tales about how customers sometimes react when asked to wait with services down normally frontline techs manage to convince them the short delay is worth it to ensure the problem is fixed for good 
 advanced service calls are thorough with a success rate over 99 % and extensive followup 
 but sometimes a customer just flat out refuses demanding we get someone out there faster 
 several weeks ago a customer in the deep end of nowhere lost tv on a few specific channels for the third time 
 cable box already replaced and wiring redone according to the contractors tickets 
 signal problem on specific qams 
 we were happy to roll out a union team 2 hours away to get it done right 
 frontline thoroughly explained why it was worth to wait for the next morning for our team but customer refused and instead got a <unk> contractor 
 two weeks after that they called again with the same issue *and the exact same thing happened again* 
 two weeks ago the customer calls again for the 5th time same story 
 despite assurances time was required for proper escalation they wanted *any* tech asap 
 the call finally gets escalated to me late afternoon 
 & gt bytewave : just lie 
 tell them that due to <unk> circumstances no technician 's available today and that he 'll have to wait till tomorrow first thing '' 
 i 'm on hold for a bit 
 but after complaining a bit about slow service customer agreed to next am because it <unk> n't be done that day 
 that 's what it 's come to having to lie to the customer to fix their problem 
 ohg would be sad 
 the high-frequency rf issue causing this problem was fixed the next am 
 though nobody else had complained about it and our network tools suggested everything was fine the backup network tech was critical to get it fixed 
 as any contractor could have noticed had they bypassed the customer 's wiring and plugged a cable box at the source 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 hello tfts 
 short story from back around the holidays 
 the company i work at makes <unk> and machine parts 
 a few months ago we were contacted by a major company to get quotes for satellite parts which is a lucrative albeit <unk> market 
 bosses decided we would produce what we could on current equipment contract what we could n't and <unk> our own <unk> <unk> cnc lathe to get more production for ourselves 
 we make cnc anyways so why not a super high-end one for our own shop 
 on the day in question we have a <unk> lathe that will turn small <unk> with incredible accuracy the engineers are excited it might cut to <unk> under a few dozen <unk> of an inch 
 however the machine also has very little in the way of <unk> which i am told get added just before final calibration 
 then over lunch something goes horribly wrong 
 this is the story on our records we may never be 100 % sure 
 the manager of this <unk> his new girlfriend in to impress her with his amazing machine 
 he leads her past several authorized personnel only signs no he is not authorized inside fabrication areas to the new lathe 
 discovering the machine is locked out a lock is in place to stop anyone from turning on power to the machine he finds a pair of bolt cutters and removes the lock 
 he then fires up the attached computer and enters a directory named something like <unk> and launches a program 
 this program brings the lathe to life and starts it in action the lathe proceeds to push the compound tool rest into the chuck of the lathe 
 the manager now panicking at the sight and sound of the machine <unk> itself apart frantically <unk> buttons on the computer before smashing its case with the bolt cutters 
 the lathe eventually hits too much <unk> from cutting itself and the motor driving the chuck catches fire and kicks out 
 the manager and his girlfriend <unk> the scene 
 he later argued that the machine had come to life on its own and that the engineers working on it were responsible 
 he goes on paid leave while the bosses look into the matter 
 they reach the obvious <unk> that the engineers and <unk> had followed company policy in securing the machine and that the manager had not only broken a dozen rules but had also engaged in activity that could be considered sabotage 
 he was fired but i do not know if they actually filed lawsuit 
 tl dr : i know why engineers <unk> did my work experience at company x where i worked in the it department so my jobs involved installing anti-virus fixing phones that employees dropped and making computers for new employees 
 so one day one of the actual it guys gets this call saying that someone 's monitor just randomly went black 
 he thinks it will be an easy fix so he decides to take me along 
 e is employee it is the actual it guy m is me 
 & gt it : so what seems to be the problem '' 
 & gt & gt e : i moved my monitor <unk> so i could see it better and it randomly went black '' i instantly thinks that a cable has fell out 
 checks the back and sure enough the input cable fell out 
 & gt m : the cable fell out 
 *plugs back in and screen lights up* there you go '' & gt & gt it : whoa **m** <unk> <unk> you cant fix it that quick you need to talk for about five minutes so they can get you a cup of tea '' 
 *five minutes and a cup of tea later* & gt it : so **m** do you think you can fix it '' 
 & gt & gt m : well it seems like a cable has fallen out the back let me get it for you *plugs back in* all done '' & gt & gt e : wow 
 thanks so much **m** tfts 
 new here 
 i work for a computer repair company that takes in a ton of strange clients 
 this client in particular happened this past monday 
 lets call her farmlady 
 & gt fl : hi my computer runs really really slow when i 'm on the internet '' 
 & gt me : hello let 's see what we find '' 
 *plugs unit into monitor and <unk> while i am plugging this computer in farmlady talks my ear off on how she loves to play <unk> 1 and 2 and also some zoo game on facebook 
 so much so that she has 3 facebook accounts so she can visit all of them and get more points or whatever 
 & gt me : well taking a look right off the bat i see nothing on this computer that may be causing problems 
 did you get this computer recently 
 **please note : this computer had no data on it whatsoever 
 there was still <unk> tb free space 
 ** & gt fl : oh no 
 i 've had this computer for over a year now 
 how can you tell if it is running defrag 
 because i do n't think it has done that in a while maybe that 's the problem 
 & gt me : well ma'am there is nothing to defrag as you have no data on this <unk> at all 
 let 's see show me how you normally use this computer on a daily basis 
 maybe we can get it to replicate the issue 
 & gt fl : *proceeds to open chrome firefox and ie 
 signs into different facebook accounts ... ... <unk> uses all 
 three 
 browsers 
 at 
 the 
 same 
 time 
 ** **tl dr : ** when you use chrome ie and firefox at the same time you 're gon na have a bad time 
 edit : i wanted to add a little clarification to this post 
 1. she plays 6 instances of <unk> on all three browsers at once 
 2. the reason the hdd space is relevant is because she kept asking me if she needed to defrag her computer 
 and was wanting to know how she could tell that if it was running or not 
 when i told her that she did n't have anything to defrag she was completely baffled 
 but i 'm on it every day '' 
 someone has built and shipped to a user a computer with the hostname set to the local administrator password 
 ping local admin password pinging local admin password <unk> 10.248.123.35 with 32 bytes of data : reply from 10.248.123.35 : <unk> <unk> & lt <unk> <unk> i 'm laughing so hard i 'm crying 
 thats the reason i 'm crying right 
 ... right 
 <unk> ... <unk> <unk> edit : i should point out that computer <unk> are like <unk> - the asset number 
 the local admin password looks a lot more like <unk> : <unk> this is not an easily missed typo ... <unk> nothing like that of course 
 but you get the <unk> happened a very long time ago when i worked for a very large organisation 3rd largest employer on the planet if that is a clue 
 i worked for a national group in this organisation and we had offices in every major city in the country 
 one of the cities had a regional holiday and i had agreed to cover any local calls while the two it support guys took the day off 
 i was not expecting much other than a few senior managers who had to catch up on work 
 no calls had come through until about 9am when a senior member from this remote office telephone number came up 
 “i’ve been trying to print and nothing is appearing in the <unk> he told me 
 “not a <unk> i said “i will remote into your machine and check it out <unk> 
 so i get onto his box and could see that someone had changed his printer to a networked one 
 “you are not printing <unk> “i am sorry” he replied 
 “you are not printing to your local printer it has been changed to a printer on the network” 
 i changed it back to the one on his desk while i explained 
 “you are printing to another printer in the <unk> 
 <unk> he said and hung up really abruptly 
 i did not expect that type of rude behaviour from this guy but then he was a pretty high level person and they could get rude 
 the next call i got was from this young secretary in one of our small offices 
 i did not get support calls from there very often since it was a small office with only 10 staff 
 this girl had started about a month before and this was her first job i think she still lived at home 
 <unk> is this it <unk> 
 she asked 
 “yes it is 
 “my printer has not stopped printing this <unk> i was kind of expecting this call and so i told her not to worry and was about to say i knew where it was coming from when she interrupted me 
 “it won’t stop printing <unk> she exclaimed 
 she had trouble saying the word <unk> as if this was something bad that her parents had told her about 
 “it is pages and pages about <unk> <unk> and their <unk> 
 “i am sorry what is it” i asked 
 <unk> parts and them having difficulty with <unk> 
 she explained 
 <unk> <unk> ” i asked 
 “i am not explaining this any more ” “there are pictures ” “we have been <unk> 
 she yelled at me in quick <unk> 
 i calmed her down and told that i had stopped the <unk> and that we would not be <unk> again 
 i guess the fellow in the other city had been trying to print out suggested solutions to his problem from various medical websites and when the first printout had not appeared he had pressed print several more times 
 he had tried to print over 25 copies of multiple articles 
 the secretary left a short while later stating that she did not feel suitable for this position 
 it seemed to have really <unk> her 
 edit : wow - front page - thanks 
 he was not in a medical profession 
 this stuff was strictly personal 
 he came in on a holiday to surreptitiously print information of a sensitive nature and read it later 
 this was back when folks did not have home broadband 
 i think that he had probably been set up to print to the remote office and then forgot about it until he remembered 
 i never <unk> it up and found out if the local support guys had done this for him 
 i thought the fellow had suffered enough 
 the offices were on opposite sides of the country roughly 50 miles apart 
 the <unk> had left after this but i think other things were also affecting it 
 she was pretty sensitive and did not handle being in a busy office well 
 closeted <unk> to frontline support staff in a busy office is tough for most folks 
 this probably did not help 
 i have no idea what the pictures showed 
 use your <unk> 
 back when i was in high school a couple years ago i was more or less tech support for most of my teachers 
 simple stuff nothing too complicated 
 this is my favorite story among many to tell from back then 
 the bell had just rung 
 i walked into class and sat down like any other day 
 after everyone had arrived and gotten situated my teacher walked to the front of the room to get class started 
 she went to turn on the projector so she could display the powerpoint with the material that she would be <unk> on 
 class had continued on for about 10 minutes or so when all of a sudden the powerpoint was gone 
 the projector had shut off by itself for some reason 
 my teacher not skipping a beat looked up at it with a determined look on her face do n't worry i know how to fix this '' 
 she took an empty chair putting it right under the projector and stood up on it 
 after taking a deep breath she placed her face against the vent on the back and blew with all her might 
 her face was turning red from how hard she was blowing 
 the class was utterly horrified 
 i did my best to contain my laughter managing to let out the words ma'am please do n't put your mouth on the projector '' 
 she turned her head and gave me this sincerely confused look 
 this is what the tech support guys did the last time i called them in here to fix this '' 
 these guys were being paid a salary for this 
 i sighed and asked her politely to get down and she complied 
 i tried to think of what to do to troubleshoot the problem 
 it was pretty obvious to me what it probably was but i wanted to confirm by hunch 
 i turned the projector back on leaving it for a couple minutes and sure enough after a while an error message popped up : check <unk> '' 
 it was overheating 
 naturally to prevent damage to itself after passing a certain temperature threshold it would shut itself off 
 i got up on the chair to see what i could do 
 i fiddled with the vent a bit and the cover popped off without much fuss to reveal a filter 
 sure enough it was totally completely clogged with dust 
 i took the filter to the trash can knocked it on the side a couple times to <unk> the dust and put it back into the projector 
 that should fix it '' i said 
 she clearly did n't believe me based on the look on her face but she <unk> me anyway and went to turn on the projector so she could resume class 
 class ended and the projector had n't <unk> out on us again and things ran smoothly for the rest of semester 
 still got a b in that class though 
 so i 'm in the military and work in tech support so to speak 
 we broadly label it data networking but it entails a huge variety of actual tech jobs 
 sometimes i 'm configuring routers other times i 'm troubleshooting equipment 
 but on this day i was on the help desk for a fairly large field <unk> 
 it can be stressful sometimes because all of the users show up at the same time and it never fails that half of them have the same problems ie 
 initial <unk> setting passwords with proper security stupid stuff like this 
 things finally calmed down for us and i went back to our hide away to relax for a bit 
 well i did n't make it very long when this pissed off <unk> came storming into the room 
 he 's all flustered because he ca n't get to the google 
 i make my way over to his office and ask him to give me a couple minutes to troubleshoot 
 thoughts running through my head initially were the basics is an ethernet cable even connected 
 yes 
 can it ping the default gateway 
 yes 
 and the dns 
 yes 
 i see his ie browser and open it 
 in the web address bar he was literally typing the google '' in and trying to load the page 
 to make my life easier and rather than explain that it does n't work that way i simply saved the page and labeled in the google for him 
 this guy joined the military before i was born and probably saw it go from <unk> mail to email 
 just one of the <unk> of tech support in the military i guess 
 *i have a accent 
 i know i do 
 its not distracting i just had <unk> growing up and then had a <unk> problem when i was younger 
 having said that in no way does my voice equal to = im indian 
 * **me** : thank you for calling bloopbleep '' 
 my name is ray may i please have your ... ... **jane** : oh hell no 
 i do not want to talk to you 
 i want somebody from america 
 **me** : umm well your in luck cause ... ... **jane** : why are you still here 
 transfer me now 
 mind you know i am part of a internal it department 
 i cant be rude no matter what 
 me and her have the same boss 
 normally that 's enough to <unk> people from being jerks but not this time 
 **me** : fine give me one sec and ill transfer you to my manager while i transfer the call i stay online in mute to hear what she is going to tell my boss *ring ring* **manager** : hello this is mr. <unk> how may i assist you today 
 she proceeds to explain that she needed her pst files set up they are stored on her shared network drive and couldnt find them 
 and then states she is in the biggest hurry and can not waste time speaking with <unk> over <unk> who might not understand her 
 my boss being the <unk> <unk> he is - **manager** : not a worry we will take care of this immediately 
 just allow me to transfer you my best agent 
 he will take care of your every need 
 is that okay mam 
 **jane** : omg thank you <unk> much for that 
 im so <unk> 
 **manager** : not a <unk> 
 stay on line and ill transfer you ... *ring ring* **me** : thank you for calling bloopbleep '' 
 my name is ray may i please have your last name 
 **jane** : <unk> ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... sure <unk> for the record im super good at my job 
 my average call handling time is like 7 mins 
 i am a tier 2 tech 
 it makes me mad that because of my slight accent people assume im indian and flat out refuse to speak to me 
 previous the vp arrived at it with a huge smile on his face his arms filled with pda’s 
 & gt vp : they’re here 
 his giddy excitement made some of the it staff turn around 
 & gt me : oh vp you’ve brought the pda’s 
 how… kind 
 i decided not to mention i’d been putting off collecting them from his office for over half a day 
 & gt vp : actually it’s also my birthday today so i thought… why not bring them down to you 
 & gt me : wait wasn’t your birthday <unk> 
 redcheer had walked up and <unk> me hard in the side 
 & gt redcheer : happy birthday vp 
 redcheer whispered something about not being rude 
 i didn’t hear what she said i was too busy trying to remember when the vp’s birthday actually was 
 & gt vp : thanks 
 er… <unk> red … anyway since i brought the <unk> the vp gestured to his arms filled with pda’s 
 & gt vp : hopefully you guys brought the cake 
 i looked around to make sure i was still actually in it not a cake store 
 yep 
 no <unk> 
 & gt me : <unk> didn’t realize you’d chosen to celebrate with us 
 & gt vp : don’t worry 
 just send someone out 
 we can celebrate together 
 i send pantsuit off to get a cake 
 the rest of it gathered awkwardly in <unk> of the vp’s birthday 
 & gt vp : actually i also need to thank the student that <unk> up my computer 
 it’s much faster now 
 where is <unk> i decided not to worry about if it actually *was* the vp’s birthday 
 i finally got to work out who was in the vp’s office 
 i gathered the it students and waited for the outcome 
 the vp looked between the three assembled students 
 & gt vp : where’s the other one 
 & gt me : other one 
 & gt vp : he’s … round 
 slight moustache 
 i looked at the three students assembled 
 nope 
 & gt vp : the one that fixed my computer… & gt defiant : <unk> 
 slight moustache … 
 the vp was nodding his head wildly 
 the three students started <unk> 
 & gt defiant : that’s <unk> 
 he works in <unk> & gt vp : a cleaner 
 & gt badshirt : ya he picked cleaning staff because of that tv show scrubs 
 apparently the janitor gets “a key to <unk> & gt vp : my office was <unk> by a … 
 <unk> 
 ** i was worried 
 a faster computer can never spell good news 
 however before i could voice that opinion pantsuit arrived back with a cake 
 it looked delightful 
 an awkward happy birthday song started 
 it forced the vp to calm slightly 
 & gt me : happy birthday vp 
 here’s some <unk> & gt vp : it does look nice 
 what a lovely birthday i get cake and a new pda 
 the cake tasted awful it looked nice but it wasn’t very useful for <unk> 
 much like something else that had just arrived in it 
 next <unk> : <unk> technician 
 main duties were building the computer to the requested specs and delivering to the end user or to the machinery it was used to run 
 <unk> : <unk> green <unk> maker 
 we had around 7 various buildings with different it equipment in them but the one that everyone dreaded <unk> into was the foundry 
 if you 've never been in a foundry they tend to involve a lot of activities like this and this needless to say this was not our most favorite place to <unk> anything 
 the one redeeming factor there were the people 
 they fixed and <unk> with whatever they had for as long as possible to help us out and we appreciated it 
 when they called for hardware they needed it 
 there was never a complaint from us about them requesting too many things as they used things to the last shred of <unk> was gone and then they called us 
 one of these fine people was <unk> aka the mad russian 
 alex was really a fun fun guy 
 got work done but when things went wrong due to ineptitude or bad planning on someone else 's part he let it be known 
 he also had the pull to make things difficult for anyone who crossed him so we usually went out of our way to keep him happy 
 usually 
 this is a story of what happened when we did n't 
 i was driving in the foundry to drop a computer off for a small office located just next to one of the hotter holes of hell located in the foundry 
 i make my drop hook up and confirm it connects 
 all is good and grab the <unk> to leave and head back to that air <unk> office 
 i can see the door at the other end but then notice a <unk> bald <unk> russian standing directly in the middle of the inside driveway 
 no no for most people but not for him 
 hell who would tell him to move 
 the following exchange occured : **alex : ** derp we need to talk 
 **derp : ** sure how can i help 
 **alex : ** where is my printer 
 **derp : ** <unk> this is n't the regular happy <unk> i 'm ... not sure i know 
 i do n't handle the printers really 
 **alex : ** <unk> with my lack of <unk> the printer i requested 3 weeks ago 
 ours broke beyond patching and we need it 
 quickly 
 please find out and get back to me asap 
 i agree and speed back to the nerd cave we have on the other end of the site 
 i approach one of the more senior techs about this 
 he <unk> me he knows and is trying to do what he can to get it and that he will contact alex 
 he does <unk> alex that due to <unk> put in place by our contracted company terrible place by the way we had to wait for too many varying levels of approval 
 alex understood he was n't happy but he understood 
 now alex is n't dumb 
 he knows things such as hardware requests replacements etc 
 are pretty low on the <unk> of it issues around there 
 the bigger issue we had was network security 
 the wireless we had was strictly for laptops and they were hardcore at making sure it stayed that way 
 no personal phones corporate phones or personal laptops ... anything not a business use laptop was allowed 
 when something not allowed connected it was noticed and that area was notified immediately 
 more than that the higher it people were forced to deal with it look into it and update <unk> on the issue etc 
 massive email chains always erupted from this 
 the very next day we get a high urgency ticket regarding network activity and an iphone 
 specifically someone attempting to logon with alex 's credentials through a phone 
 emails were <unk> 
 alex was contacted 
 the phone was disconnected from the network 
 as he had recently gotten the phone he was made aware and disconnected 
 he also became aware of just how serious this network intrusion '' seemed to be 
 fast forward to the next day ... around 1 pm the following day the same thing happened 
 emails alex contacted phone disconnected from network ticket resolved 
 again the following day it occurred 
 it started happening each and every day 
 ignorance no longer a valid excuse this email <unk> was becoming a hassle for all those involved as it touched some pretty important it mailboxes not to mention some higher ranking managers of the plant overall 
 not soon after this first week of calculated attacks '' he stepped up his game 
 2 times a day he would connect his phone to the network 
 by the middle of the second week our it broke 
 literally 
 every other email seemed to be about why we could n't keep the network secure 
 why all these <unk> were happening 
 to the passive viewer of emails most higher ups who were cc 'd out of requirement all this looked like was a bad it company not able to do their job 
 to us in the it area it was pure genius 
 he could n't get his printer in a reasonable time 
 fine but to make up for it he would <unk> the it higher ups with so much grief and email that he would be impossible to ignore 
 finally one of the higher it people of our company called him directly 
 at first to berate him on his constant breach of wireless protocol 
 he left a stern voicemail and stood by in fake <unk> as he told us it was handled 
 a call came in but as he was talking we were to listen and let it go to our department voicemail 
 when he finished he turned saw the missed call was alex and put the phone on speaker before playing it 
 obviously expecting it to be an apology but getting something much much different 
 voicemail starts *in a heavy russian <unk> i 'm aware that i 've broken your ... rules 
 i do not care 
 i 've waited 
 i 've followed <unk> to get a printer for this area 
 you ignore me 
 can you ignore me now 
 i want 
 my 
 printer 
 *click* the bossman stands in silence not sure what to think 
 we all sit there doing our best not to laugh our asses off at his failed attempt at returning order to the land 
 if the situation was n't perfect enough we all got an email as we sat there in stunned silence 
 intrusion alert 
 2 days later alex got his printer 
 mad russian 
 not anymore 
 **tl dr** russian turns into cold calculating network <unk> to convince it higher ups to give him what he deserves 
 so i work tech support for a popular camera company 
 i answered this call 
 me : thank you for calling in to ... customer : you guys sent me the wrong fucking camera 
 me : sorry to hear about this sir which camera did you receive 
 customer : i ordered the <unk> which is the most expensive one 
 this piece of shit did not come with a touch screen 
 me : sir the model you ordered may be our most expensive camera but this particular model does not come with a built in touch screen 
 customer : well what the fuck kind of logic is that 
 me : sorry sir i can understand how this can be frustrating <unk> customer : fuck this shit 
 i want a supervisor 
 i will get an upgrade 
 i do n't care if i have to get all the way to the fucking ceo 
 me : unfortunately there are no supervisors <unk> at this time 
 customer : well i hope you lose your job and that your entire company goes under 
 sometimes i ca n't fucking believe how entitled and ignorant people are ... one day at my first job i was called into the bosses office 
 with a stern face he said we have to have a talk '' 
 when i enquired what was going on he said it was about the software i wrote hacking into the company '' 
 and that i was to be fired for breaking the law 
 he handed me an envelope with what i assume was my <unk> notice 
 i asked what the hell he was talking about 
 he said there is no point hiding it you have been caught and i have the evidence right here 
 pointing to his laptop '' 
 he then asked if i had anything to say before he called the police 
 i asked to see the evidence on the laptop he turned it around and showed an error message on the screen 
 it read this program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down '' 
 edit : a few requested that i finish the story so here it is this is a story from awhile ago and i only just found this subreddit so i apologize if this does n't quite fit 
 i was working tech support for a rather large isp 
 female customer calls in does n't know their password 
 ok i can reset it for you but you need to answer the security question first 
 oh my husband set that up 
 i 'm not sure i know it '' 
 i 'm sure you can get it ma'am 
 where did you go on your <unk> '' 
 answers in 2 seconds <unk> '' 
 uh that 's not what i have here ... '' what 
 i know that 's where we went 
 i was there '' 
 i 'm sorry ma'am that 's not the answer that was put in '' 
 wait wait wait 
 does it say hawaii '' 
 yes ma'am that 's what i have here '' 
 that 's where he went with his first wife 
 imma need to call you back 
 <unk> '' 
 *click* i sat there for a moment and then laughed my ass off 
 ltr ftp and <unk> english so excuse my crappy text 
 a little background i work for a pretty small company doing support and mostly helpdesk to an erp system which our clients get access via <unk> 
 the thing is sometimes this vpn service get stuck and the client ca n't access to erp so i need to connect using remote desktop to client computer and <unk> the service 
 months ago i got a mail from one of our clients 
 ** $ client : ** i ca n't access to erp can you give me some help 
 ** $ me : ** sure can you give me authorization to get access to you computer 
 and the id and password from remote desktop app please 
 ** $ client : ** yeah there is : <unk> : xxxx this gon na be easy huh 
 wrong i get a error from the app : *the app is n't open in the remote client* oh well maybe is a wrong number or something ** $ me : ** excuse me ma'am i ca n't access to your computer can you open your app and give me again the id and password please 
 ** $ client : ** sure is <unk> : <unk> yup new password 
 the thing is everytime you close and open the app the password changes the only thing does n't change is their id but i always ask because sometimes they are on another computer or in a <unk> travel with company laptop 
 so i put again the new password : *the app is n't open in the remote client* what 
 again 
 ** $ me : ** ma'am please do not close the app and this time can give me the password only 
 ** $ client : ** sure is <unk> 
 putting the password : *the app is n't open in the remote client* ** heavy sigh ** ** $ me : ** ma'am please do not close the app because if you do i ca n't access to your computer and i ca n't fix your issue 
 ** $ client : ** oh the app was annoying me and i ca n't do some work with the app open i thought you only need the password and <unk> to my computer meanwhile i do some work 
 ** $ me** : ** <unk> ** later i get a glass of whiskey 
 **tl dr : user believes in <unk> edit : some format and corrections 
 my coworker just tried to send an email but it would not send 
 i had her check her email box size : <unk> 
 ** yes 
 you read that right over <unk> <unk> of email most of that in her deleted items folder 
 her response : i thought when i deleted an email it was deleted '' 
 i used the throwing paper in the trash can under her desk <unk> 
 she empty her deleted items folder 
 5 minutes later email she was trying to send was sent on its way 
 somewhere an it person is wondering about all the space that just opened up on a server 
 edit : it may have been <unk> 
 i only got to see the ridiculous amount for a brief moment 
 edit 2 : my email box size : <unk> kb edit 3 : not in it 
 just tech '' person in office 
 previous i pinched my nose and winced 
 the day refused to end 
 & gt defiant : <unk> then on the final boss you can do this triple combo ... & gt me : defiant as much as i love hearing about your game adventures i need to ask you ... were you <unk> computers upstairs 
 & gt defiant : nope 
 was n't me 
 as i wondered who it could have been i looked down at the ticket queue 
 & gt defiant : anyway as i was saying the triple combo has this dash which means you can dodge ... & gt me : oh look 
 the <unk> ticket 
 i <unk> clicked on any in the queue 
 as defiant looked at the ticket he continued to recount his game adventures 
 i tried to zone out i failed 
 & gt me : how about we have another bet 
 & gt defiant : the ticket is impossible 
 you ca n't get a computer to fill out sales forms for you 
 & gt me : i would n't say ... impossible but its certainly not an it support ticket 
 defiant looked thoughtful he stood <unk> silence for a few moments 
 & gt defiant : you 'd need a microphone voice recognition software ... a speech <unk> ... & gt me : all that effort just to save clicking on an object and typing in the number ordered 
 so if you can talk him out of it we 're even 
 & gt defiant : done 
 i did n't mention he 'd be convincing a sales staff member who talked people <unk> things for a living 
 ***** arriving at voicerecon 's desk a smiling happy man looked up at us 
 & gt voicerecon : so happy to see you 
 i never get to see it 
 & gt defiant : i 'm afraid we 've come to say no to your proposal 
 & gt voicerecon : oh that 's alright 
 i just thought it would be fairly useful when i 'm talking to clients i want focus 100 % on the sale 
 if i had the computer fill out the forms itself would n't have to worry about writing everything down 
 i turned to leave but defiant was stuck 
 he 'd looked voicerecon in the eye so felt compelled to reply 
 & gt defiant : well you already record the call 
 why not just <unk> the tape and fill in the forms after the call 
 & gt voicerecon : wow you 're pretty smart young man 
 that would work but do n't have time to listen to a whole call again 
 defiant smiled at the compliment and continued thinking 
 & gt me : time to go 
 & gt defiant : wait a sec i 'll solve this problem 
 okay how about just marking the <unk> times of the call 
 so you only have to <unk> to the orders 
 voicerecon looked like a <unk> he smiled down at his prey 
 & gt voicerecon : excelent idea 
 however i 'd need a <unk> so i can record locally 
 at the moment it 's all saved on a server ... defiant and voicerecon bounced ideas off each other for a full fifteen minutes 
 eventually defiant was <unk> by the entire idea 
 & gt defiant : actually the auto fill idea could work ... & gt voicerecon : mmm what do you think airz 
 voicerecon and defiant stared up at me 
 i was honestly in awe of voicerecon 's sales ability being able to <unk> defiant so quickly 
 & gt me : i 'll get back to you 
 ***** getting back to my office defiant looked quite happy 
 & gt me : you realize you just lost another bet 
 & gt defiant : <unk> is a solid idea 
 plus even you could n't say no to him 
 & gt me : defiant come here 
 i 'll show you how it deals with a ticket like this 
 **new email** - to voicerecon <unk> 
 ** from it 
 & gt defiant : just no 
 wo n't he argue 
 & gt me : trusty faceless email 
 you ca n't argue with a computer 
 next i work for a large construction company providing advanced level technical support to our end users 
 i am incredibly lucky that many of the people i support are very technical at the very least in their own field so supporting them is usually <unk> and interesting 
 yesterday i received a call from one these very technical or so i thought users who also has a thick accent which can lead to misunderstandings at times 
 let 's call him miguel 
 *ring ring* & gt me : hey miguel <unk> 
 & gt miguel : yes hey good morning <unk> do you have any lubricant for a hard drive so i can relubricate it 
 me : <unk> blankly at phone trying to determine if this is a <unk> & gt me after a slight pause : just to confirm you are looking for lubricant for a hard drive 
 & gt miguel : yes the drive is making noises and i want to <unk> at this point my coworkers all chuckled after hearing the question i posed back to miguel 
 i begin laughing harder and harder so i ca n't really understand him anymore 
 & gt me : miguel i have to call you back in 90 seconds 
 i hang up laugh cry and <unk> myself 
 i call him back 
 & gt miguel immediately upon picking up the phone : you done 
 & gt me : hey so hard drives are totally sealed units that do n't have <unk> in the traditional sense 
 can you tell me specifically what 's going on 
 & gt miguel : the drive is making all sorts of mechanical noises like grinding and clicking 
 i want to disassemble it so i can relubricate it then i can plug it in again and get all the data off it 
 <unk> desk* & gt me : okay first of all do not disassemble the drive 
 secondly stop turning it on or plugging it in 
 the more of those noises you hear the more potential damage you are doing 
 lastly get your <unk> ready and call <unk> <unk> 
 it turns out he was just trying to help '' the marketing manager who sits next to him who did n't want to lose all her music 
 i ended up selling her on <unk> match mac user natch and the importance of backups 
 tl dr if it goes bump in the night you need an <unk> not lubricant 
 i 'm doing some work for a customer with a significant industrial control system network spread over a large campus 
 i 'm not directly assessing their security but the work requires me to be in contact with their it and infosec folks 
 $ customer 's ics systems present a risk to property and human life if they fail so there have to be significant controls to protect them 
 their ics network is a separate network from the <unk> it network not under the control of it or information security 
 the ics group is very tight <unk> even with company it and is staff 
 any questions i ask regarding their ics infrastructure are <unk> with : all our ics is on an airgapped network so we 're good my work <unk> <unk> $ customer 's <unk> infrastructure so i 'm not going to get all cranky 
 i do need to ask a responsible person a <unk> questions so i get an audience with an ics lead 
 in order to not be a complete fool when i get to talk to the ics person i spend some quality time getting <unk> with the <unk> and potentially the kinds of devices one might find in an enterprise in $ customer 's line of work 
 until i find 'the document 
 when i did <unk> we often talked about the <unk> gun document where someone admits that they knew the product was <unk> from <unk> <unk> code but sold it anyway 
 never saw one 
 until now 
 i 've found a manufacturer of fiber switches with an open share of marketing documents including a detailed network diagram of $ customer 's ics fiber network showing switch locations names model numbers 
 it also clearly shows how ics and <unk> traffic travels through the same network and switches 
 the switches break out traffic but sit on both networks 
 i print a copy 
 i get to actually meet ics person for ten minutes since he 's running late from one meeting 
 i get to ask him the dumb questions i had 
 i think they were about physical security access logs or something like that 
 i 'm about to leave but i ca n't let it go 
 me : '' i keep hearing that you have an airgap 
 how do you validate it '' 
 ics guy looking annoyed that i 'm breathing his air : '' we designed it that way '' me : '' i get that 
 how do you know nobody 's plugged in something that bridges it or allows outside access '' 
 ics guy : '' the ics network is designed separately from the it network '' me : handing him the schematic : '' so can you show me the airgap on this map '' 
 ics guy visibly turning pale : '' how 'd you get this '' 
 me : '' from the vendor 
 but if this is accurate you 're <unk> traffic at layer 2 or 3. the switches are visible from both networks 
 i 'm going to guess that you have n't locked them to serial only access since some of them are hard to get to '' 
 ics guy : '' you 'll have to delete this document from your laptop 
 it 's classified and proprietary '' me : '' sure 
 but a google search for $ customer $ <unk> $ <unk> will show it 
 i think you 've got some work to do '' i 'm still friendly with a few it people there 
 they 're working on it 
 they at least asked the vendor to take down the schematic 
 any sufficiently advanced technology is <unk> from magic '' 
 - <unk> c. <unk> earlier today i was working on a <unk> where i had to remote into a pc and install adobe flash player 
 simple enough right 
 well it would have been but while i was in the computer someone at the store walked by and saw it moving around all by itself 
 instead of <unk> it up to ghosts and leaving it at that they decided to take action 
 they went over to the computer and <unk> tried to <unk> the demon from the computer by constantly dragging the mouse down toward the start menu to shut it down 
 after almost a minute of fighting this person for control of the mouse i finally managed to click in the address bar at the top of the browser to type a message to get them to stop we usually do this to let them know we are working on it and get them to stop fighting us 
 normally i would just type something like this is the help desk please stop moving the mouse '' 
 but today i tried to be funny 
 i typed word for word i ca n't let you do that dave '' 
 the person stopped moving the mouse so i figured it worked and they had run away to prevent being ejected into space but a few seconds later the screen went black and i was kicked out of the pc 
 i pinged it from command prompt and it was completely offline 
 the person at the store pulled the power cord to stop the demons from escaping 
 about a minute later a co-worker of mine received a frantic call from a user whose computer was being hacked and identity was being stolen 
 hilariously enough his name was dave 
 edit : after the fact i learned the the person who called back who was also the other person trying to use the computer was actually one of our level 2 support group guys 
 he was remoted into the *same* computer at the *same* time and had no idea what i was trying to do 
 yes his name was actually dave which is why he was freaking out at the time 
 all in all it was a very hilarious day 
 : edit2 : i also learned today thanks reddit 
 that <unk> has a feature to lock the keyboard/mouse of whoever you 're remoting into so this silly scenario will never happen again 
 : : : emergency alarms went off at my condo tower a few days ago 
 in every condo here there are at least three alarms all ringing and flashing red lights at the maximum <unk> level considered safe by regulation whenever it happens 
 guess what happens when my four emergency alarms go off each at <unk> safe <unk> 
 combined is so loud i get a little ear damage every time i 'm sure 
 thankfully it 's a rare event but i still wanted to write to building management about it 
 leaving my telework console i ran stairs down 6 levels to get away from this crazy noise like everybody else 
 elevators are a hazard when there 's a fire emergency 
 fire trucks rapidly surrounded the tower as cops started redirecting traffic 
 we 're very close to a joint emergency services compound and it shows 
 the day there 's a real emergency it 'll be nice 
 fifteen firemen go up the stairs and a few down to underground parking 
 one of them is notably a bald 6 feet 9 '' half-giant <unk> the largest fire axe i 've ever seen 
 there 's perhaps up to a hundred people living here outside the tower now and i know this is likely to take a bit so i go grab an early lunch and coffee 
 i come back well over 40 minutes later 
 fire trucks are still there the entire road is cut off 
 people are mostly on the other side of the road because <unk> outside the alarms are too <unk> 
 babies are crying 
 it 's so freaking cold i see men with <unk> on their <unk> hair 
 a fireman is addressing the crowd 
 & gt fireman : we 've determined this to be a false alarm as soon as we figure out a few issues with your primary fire panel downstairs the alarms will stop 
 anyone who can bear the noise can go straight back in '' 
 nobody does 
 it 's just not <unk> 
 & gt other owner : what few issues 
 just shut it off if it 's a false alarm '' 
 & gt fireman : we 're trying but there might be something wrong with it 
 we have someone good on it should just be a matter of minutes '' 
 ... i shut down that thing before 
 never been any issues ... & gt other other owner : my kid is freezing but it 's too loud in there 
 i 'm going inside elsewhere someone text me please '' 
 & gt bytewave : fireman i 've shut this down before 
 lem me just mildly <unk> the ear damage with earbuds 
 okay let 's go '' 
 he shrugs and waves me in and we head downstairs into the underground parking and straight to the electric room where the primary panel is for the alarm system 
 there after getting through the door guarded by two cops with fingers in their ears i find half a dozen firemen staring at the thing 
 the half-giant with his <unk> battleaxe seems particularly intent on driving it through the thing 
 another fireman is holding a manual and screaming the lines written in it at their operator 
 next to him is a huge open <unk> of manuals presumably for all commonplace systems like this one 
 the operator is pushing buttons seemingly at random 
 & gt bytewave : i 've shut this down before 
 the power button is up on the top left on the <unk> part it 'll shut down the system and the alarm wo n't be on anymore once it boots back up '' 
 & gt fireman2 : i know 
 i tried 
 the power button does n't work 
 we 're trying the emergency codes now '' 
 ... the power button does n't work 
 ... well stuff can always break even a power button but after 20 years fixing stuff i 've come to believe some <unk> are less plausible than others 
 i never even encountered a real issue wholly caused by a power button 
 & gt bytewave : did you hold it down '' 
 & gt fireman2 : what '' 
 & gt bytewave : hold the power button down for 5 seconds '' 
 ... he complies 
 alarms stop 
 he looks at me with an even mix of <unk> and 'i 'm about to facepalm now 
 did nobody there ever have to shut down a computer before 
 ... eh whatever let 's get something out of this instead of just rubbing it in 
 i take out my earbuds 
 & gt bytewave : hey happy to help 
 now the noise these alarms make is crazy 
 is it up to code 
 any of you feeling a little deaf right now '' 
 they confirmed to me each alarm was up to code but that together they crossed the threshold 
 somehow nobody planned for this when we had this tower built 
 & gt bytewave : okay i 'd like this in writing so we can get it <unk> easily 
 do you think it would be possible to ... '' & gt half-giant with battleaxe : of course 
 give us your email i 'll send you something '' 
 incredibly enough merely an hour later i got a <unk> advisory from the fire department that our alarms were too loud 
 already forwarded to building management 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 i do n't work in it i know that a simple google search can fit a lot 
 apparently google is too hard for some people 
 anyway on to the story ... i was living in a share house and one room mate was a <unk> in her 30s and an artist 
 one day her phone broke and she went out and got another <unk> prepaid 
 she wanted to download a program for her art thing to do digital works on her phone but she could n't find google play 
 she asked for my help and i watched her go through her phone and sure enough it was n't there 
 after a minute of going through her phone settings and what not i noticed her home screen was n't like normal androids 
 with a little bit of a suspicion i asked her to restart her phone before we try a factory reset 
 sure enough she had a nokia 
 i facepalmed so hard internally before telling her she has a windows phone and they do n't have google play and it 's not an app you can <unk> : long story ahead 
 <unk> working for a big company with branches in many countries 
 i and my colleagues are responsible for around 200 servers and everything support related for employees inside the building and field staff 
 you could say i am the it janitor 
 this story actually made me so furious that i had an <unk> to punch a hole in the wall for the whole day 
 so today i’ll tell you the story of the in my opinion <unk> department of the company 
 it all started on a monday morning when <unk> 
 i got a call from my beloved marketing department 
 the call goes like this : & gt md : hello toast this is $ <unk> 
 the copier isn’t working again 
 you really need to fix this 
 & gt me : ok. what’s the problem 
 & gt md : it’s only printing half of the page i need 
 seems to be a easy fix 
 just some printer settings 
 no big deal 
 they mess the settings up every week 
 & gt me : ok that should do the trick 
 could you try and print it again 
 & gt md : ok one <unk> after 2 minutes waiting i hear a <unk> sound through the phone 
 & gt md : what have you done 
 get up here immediately 
 you are in big trouble 
 & gt me : what the <unk> on my way 
 so i walked up to their office and what is the first thing i see… <unk> toner everywhere around the copier … and pissed off <unk> so i asked what on earth is going on here 
 the respond was screamed into my face from $ <unk> 
 & gt sg1 : you see exactly what happened here 
 its your fault 
 you will pay for this 
 points at her with toner <unk> jeans & gt me : please stay calm and explain me what happened 
 & gt sg1 : you broke the printer and now everything is fucked up 
 & gt me : i see… so investigated the <unk> around the copier 
 the panel you open to get to the toner was ripped off 
 the toner was lying on the ground in two pieces and there was toner on the carpet 2 meters around and on the copier 
 so i asked her what she did in the 2 minutes i was waiting on the phone 
 & gt sg1 : it was not working again 
 so i tried to fix it myself 
 & gt me : you tried to fix it yourself 
 & gt sg1 : its your fault 
 it should work in the first place 
 now the rest of the department jumped in and helped sg1 stand her ground 
 after 15 minutes of <unk> is <unk> “you broke our <unk> “i am not <unk> and other stuff i’m kinda used to i just said that i’ll be right back to clean the mess 
 i know those people for not quite a year now but i know that they are not the most intelligent people in the company 
 so i told them to stay away from the copier because it’s important that the toner is not pressed into the carpet 
 also toner is nasty stuff you should better not put on your sandwich 
 so i left the office to get the special vacuum cleaner for toner 
 and you might see where this is <unk> when i came back into the office there were <unk> everywhere around the copier … that was the moment where i lost my <unk> and got pissed 
 bad idea… i mean getting <unk> & gt me : ok who the **** walked straight through the toner 
 then it started 
 a shitstorm of complaints about how i was useless 
 now i realized that there is no way to talk to them like normal people would do so i just started cleaning the mess up with that very very noisy vacuum cleaner 
 at this point i just ignored everything they complained about 
 so after 15 minutes of cleaning and putting the broken stuff into a bag i left with no words 
 after only 5 minutes i got a call from my area manager 
 he told me that the marketing department is complaining to all highly ranked people in the company that i broke their copier damaged the office and <unk> their clothing 
 also they said you left without cleaning your mess up 
 ... that’s it those <unk> random <unk> will <unk> 
 after i explained everything to him he was on my site and it was time to think about the punishment 
 so what to do ... there are many things i thought about at this <unk> most of them would bring me in jail for a <unk> <unk> but there were some ways to make their job harder that are not <unk> not that brutal and <unk> **punishment 1 : ** writing a full report of sg1 destroying company material worth around <unk> broken copier broken toner until the end of days black carpet **punishment 2 : ** talking with my colleagues about declining calls from them 
 they are now not allowed to call us directly except for an very important emergency 
 everything else needs to be put in as a ticket 
 **punishment 3 : ** i have the servers i have the power 
 password resets every week with special rules : 10 character length min 3 special characters min 2 numbers both small and big letters and the passwords must be different to the one before by 5 characters 
 and <unk> before… the list goes 100 passwords into the past atm 
 as long as they do not apologize to me i won’t change anything 
 the end of the story is that my report went high up to the boss and sg1 got to a first and last warning 
 if she <unk> shit up again she is fired 
 i think they 've learned their lesson 
 they haven’t said a single word to me except for <unk> and <unk> since then 
 ps : there was a trainee i know in the room when sg1 broke everything 
 so i knew exactly what was going on in those 2 minutes i was waiting at the phone and while i was gone for the vacuum cleaner 
 i <unk> like this : <unk> goes to the copier waits for 10 seconds <unk> the copier tries to open the printer with force rips off the opening mechanism of the printer forces the toner out looks at it and starts shaking it 
 toner is flying around and she <unk> the toner at the copier 
 toner cartridge <unk> in two pieces and <unk> toner everywhere 
 copier got damaged by the hit too 
 after i went for the vacuum cleaner she walks to the copier again and <unk> around how stupid i am 
 that’s it 
 i’m done with this department 
 sorry for mistakes while writing 
 my native language is not english so there are definitely mistakes in my text : edit : due to some people telling me how <unk> the password policy is here are some more <unk> for that : everyone thinking that is 100 % right 
 it is not professional and not secure at all 
 they will write the password down and stuff 
 i 'm not going to let this new rule stand for a long time 
 just for 1 more week 
 maximum 2. but hell i laughed when the trainee told me how hard it was for them to change the password for the first time 
 btw 
 trainee was not affected by that stuff 
 also ... i know that they were writing the passwords down the whole time ... i told them to stop that but they ignored it 
 i even told the supervisor about that problem but it seems like they ignored it too 
 i 've already become loud while telling them to stop that 
 they had lists with passwords under their keyboard 
 so the security hole in this department ca n't get that much bigger ... i was told you guys might enjoy this : i went to the surgeon 's the other day for a <unk> and to get my <unk> out yay 
 he logged into the computer and pulled up the pictures he took of the inside of my wrist 
 as they came up he made a joke about how the pictures wo n't mean anything to me because it 's not your fault you did n't go to medical school '' 
 to which i gave him the requisite chuckle 
 then when he could n't get the program to <unk> the pictures properly on the screen and i had to show him how to use the computer i said to him do n't worry this is what i went to school for i would n't expect it to make sense to you '' 
 he did n't think it was all that funny 
 true <unk> of the most ridiculous calls i ever got working as senior staff at my telco 
 false impact event report 
 & gt bytewave : senior line bytewave 
 you may send me your ticket '' 
 & gt oblivious subcontractor os : uhh yeah my customer just lost service give me a minute pretty sure i got this '' 
 ... & gt os : there 
 i think you should have it '' 
 ticket reads : customer offline due to <unk> 
 & gt bytewave : ... there 's *just* been a <unk> <unk> 
 do we have an exact location 
 we need to determine impact on the network first did you test the node '' 
 & gt os : no ... i dunno '' 
 of course you dunno 
 checking node 
 checking news as i run the test nothing unusual ... & gt bytewave : ... <unk> 
 your customer is the only one offline in the area as you *should* have noticed 
 the <unk> happen to strike his living room or what '' 
 & gt os : i guess 
 he said it fell from the sky and now there 's no tv and internet '' 
 i 'm not believing it obviously but got ta check the ... **oh come on 
 ** & gt bytewave : when the customer contacted you did you not get the automatic popup with his call history and <unk> of previous calls '' 
 & gt os : yeah ... '' & gt bytewave : how did you miss the fact that the last call was about ufos and packet loss '' 
 & gt os : no i read it ... but it 's closed so ... '' & gt bytewave : how about the fact his modem is offline <unk> the battery is still <unk> 
 we 're still getting readings from it 
 it 's just unplugged '' 
 ... & gt bytewave : there 's notification in bold in the comments that the customer has called us several times to report <unk> problems that did not <unk> out 
 lets assume a <unk> hits an apartment building in a big city and <unk> just one customer loses service ... wait no let 's not even 
 that will never happen 
 and if it did how do you think you 'd learn about it 
 from a customer with multiple documented frivolous calls '' 
 & gt os : okay ... but ... i guess i do n't have to schedule a service call '' 
 ... & gt bytewave : obviously not 
 i 'm <unk> this account for review 
 he 'll be contacted within 24 hours by someone who will politely offer him a choice between terminating service or keeping it while <unk> his phone number from technical support 
 can you explain to him gently that he will be contacted within a day regarding this issue '' 
 & gt os : i 'm not sure he seems pretty upset ... '' & gt bytewave : okay then 
 tell him we 'll call him back within fifteen minutes i 'll hand the call over immediately to an agent with ... more impact event expertise '' 
 & gt os : oh 
 great thank you '' 
 & gt bytewave : ... thank you for choosing senior line '' 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 i 've unfortunately taken down this story and my related comments a few weeks ago my most popular so far because there was a substantial witch-hunt going on for a time about it at work after it made /r/all and i had reasons to believe it was an employment risk 
 at the time the two parts together had over <unk> ups and 6 <unk> 
 thanks to it everyone at work has heard about /r/talesfromtechsupport now 
 but it 's no longer an issue 
 i have confirmation that it was largely overblown and that i was never actually at risk of identification despite early information to the contrary 
 i hate <unk> and i feel bad for ever taking it offline 
 so i 'm rectifying that tonight by <unk> whole thing here the hell with it 
 for the curious about past comments i present the internet 's inability to forget though with atrocious formatting 
 part 1 was <unk> entirely here while part 2 is all here comments included the <unk> about plaintext passwords led to this without further <unk> the whole thing i deleted because i briefly got scared of hr 's plastic teeth 
 we 're all humans with bills to pay but in the end all that is needed for hr to triumph is for employees to do nothing 
 <unk> in <unk> of fallen colleagues - causes of <unk> love justice system <unk> 21st century <unk> against unions 
 this story contains a healthy <unk> of legal drama but i believe it 's still relevant here 
 awhile ago my isp laid off in one day 8 unionized employees and about a dozen non-union staff and managers including a director and in the end were quite unhappy to have to do so 
 legally this happened over <unk> 
 we 're a big company and of course many couples formed at work and in many cases began to live together 
 we 're also all entitled to generous discounts on all our services with several being simply free for all employees 
 you can get a package of cable internet phone and mobile that would normally cost 300 $ <unk> for about 60 $ if you go for a set of high-end options as we mostly all do 
 the <unk> was that when two employees lived together one of them <unk> lost this privilege as a single privileged account covers everything you can possibly need at one address 
 the <unk> used by everyone for years to avoiding wasting their perk for living with whoever they loved was simple one of them would put the home address of a relative as their own just to avoid wasting the perk 
 legally this has now been determined to be fraud but at the time it seemed like an <unk> workaround and it was fairly common knowledge among average employees that was how you dealt with it and nobody cared until the day one manager with an axe to grind found out two union reps in love together were doing exactly that 
 suddenly legal hr and the president of the company started pushing panic buttons frantically 
 so began the great witchhunt 
 initially according to sources close to <unk> <unk> the company their initial plan was just to fire the two that had been <unk> out and issue a stern company wide warning against such practices 
 but orders rapidly came down from the office of the president that this fell well short of sufficient 
 the <unk> were left alone for now 
 legal papers were drawn up six people with great suits plotting world <unk> with legal degrees picked up their best italian leather <unk> and went to court requesting a closed audience to discuss 'potential fraud 
 they argued that the audience had to be kept under <unk> because for the time being the 'potential <unk> had access to information that <unk> <unk> national <unk> our databases have lots of confidential information on millions of customers and yes everyone aside from the frontline grunts can read their emails and see their passwords if they were aware of procedures against them and that police action would be <unk> if word got out before the potential fraud was fully <unk> 
 *hey they said national security 
 motion granted 
 * the secrecy prevented the union from knowing about the proceedings or representing anyone at this stage 
 law at least ensured that a public attorney would represent the parties which did not know they were accused but without the possibility of contacting them to organize a defense 
 at audience they explained the situation the suspicion it was <unk> amongst rank and file employees in a relationship with another 
 and that since the company had no records regarding who was sleeping with whom there was only one logical thing do : <unk> police to secretly collect gps data on the cellphones of every union employee for 7 days to ensure they were not lying about their place of <unk> 
 of course only police would see the data compare it to listed addresses claiming employee discounts and report mismatches to the court for further action 
 hey why not it 's not like this is <unk> <unk> or something they did say national security let 's do it 
 then the generic public attorney gpa finally said something useful 
 the dialogue is based on secondary sources and is not word for word 
 & gt gpa : are unionized employees the only ones with these benefits '' 
 & gt evil corporate lawyers ecl : well technically anyone working for the corporation has ... '' & gt gpa : defense moves that if such an action is authorized national security could also be affected by any non-union employee with access to the company 's database that any warrant must be broadened to the entire company and coupled with a gag order that <unk> anyone with knowledge of these proceedings to share this information with any employee of the corporation including upper management '' 
 & gt ecl : your honor we do not believe such a risk exists and that the high hiring standards and regular screening of our <unk> personnel who unlike the union workers fall under our strict corporate policy instead of a very limiting work contract make the risk <unk> that they could <unk> us 
 it 's not worth the time of law enforcement to investigate such a dead end '' 
 & gt gpa : amongst all people with employee discounts and access to systems that could access information that might in any way impact national security what is the ratio of union to non-union personnel 
 & gt ecl : <unk> relevance '' 
 & gt gpa : essential to <unk> the extent to which non-union personnel could theoretically impact <unk> security 
 & gt judge : <unk> please answer '' 
 & gt ecl : well i do n't have exact numbers on hand but uhm slightly more non-union personnel overall in the entire structure but ... '' obviously there was more to it than this 
 corporate could bring in witnesses whereas gpa could n't given his inability to contact those he represented 
 we 're told he managed to get a government official to testify to his belief that the threat posed by isp 's employees ability to realistically damage national security through access to systems was <unk> low but to no avail 
 still his main point had being heard 
 & gt judge : be it ordered that a mandate is given to city police to establish within 30 days the technical basis for a 7 days <unk> of every person with a listed address with employee discounts at the corporation limited to the collection of gps data of the wireless devices listed in the accounts in question that everyone aware of these procedures is sworn to absolutely secrecy about the <unk> of this order on pain of criminal sanctions and police is to report within 60 days after collection of cases of potential fraud to this court and that all collected data that does not point out to potential fraud must be immediately destroyed 
 the contents of this hearing will remain sealed for the time being '' 
 soon after a colleague of mine part of our unionized security department mostly in charge of ignoring thousands of piracy claims that very often involve references to the <unk> even though we 're in canada ... and also in charge of <unk> with all police military or judicial requests to the corporation in complete secrecy got the very weird call 
 he told me about it once he was legally allowed to 
 & gt policeman : do you understand the contents and limitations of the mandate and that you 're personally sworn to secrecy for the <unk> by virtue of it 's content and that failure to ... '' & gt internal security : yes i understand have to track my own damn cellphone 's position for a week and a few thousands others your paperwork is in order 
 soo if i turn off my cellphones for a week do i go to jail '' 
 & gt policeman : this is no laughing matter 
 and i do not advise that 
 how much time to do you need to setup a track of this magnitude '' 
 & gt internal security : oh let 's see thousands of accounts about 50 % more sims hmm ... '' & gt policeman : the volume is going to be a problem is n't it '' 
 & gt internal security : the only problem is that a judge signed off on this 
 eta 24 to 48 hours '' 
 policeman : could you then next week <unk> it against employee accounts to ... '' & gt internal security : could sure 
 will no 
 that falls outside my job description and your mandate 
 i will provide you in bulk the relevant addresses and gathered gps metadata within 24 to 48 hours after the big brother week is over 
 given the <unk> i wo n't send it electronically i will have a physical thumbdrive for you to pick up '' 
 & gt policeman : this will cover your <unk> but it 's less than helpful '' 
 & gt internal security : then that is less than my problem 
 have a good day policeman '' 
 and so soon after my cellphone was legally <unk> only for gps data for a week 
 thousands of others too 
 including the president 's and the ecls 
 what could possibly go wrong 
 - tl : dr 1/2 - upon <unk> two union reps were living together and <unk> the rules about employee benefits in a way many had done since forever upper management launched a legal witchhunt that involved getting legal rights to track every union employee 's cellphone 's gps data for a week in utter secrecy and they argued <unk> security** to get their way 
 but it backfired when a random public <unk> forced them to track management 's cellphones too 
 fast forward a few months in part because local police is notoriously slow working with gps data when we don’t do their job for them we 're back in court 
 & gt policeman : over the course of the investigation we have established 18 mismatches and 6 potential mismatches between listed addresses and the usual patterns of movement 
 a small <unk> of sims could not be tracked either because they were offline not in working devices or outside network coverage 
 the threshold of evidence for possible fraud charges is met and a copy of the report has gone to the crown 's <unk> for evaluation 
 in a case like this the <unk> of criminal charges were extremely low but section <unk> 1 of the ccc <unk> such cases to be reviewed by <unk> <unk> over 5k can land you in jail for up to 14 years *in <unk> 
 & gt judge : very well 
 before the report can be released to the parties the court wishes to know what procedures have been or will be put in place by the corporation to limit any threats of the sort discussed earlier in the process from playing out once information leaves these walls 
 & gt ecl : we will build our cases rapidly at which point we will terminate the employees we are convinced <unk> fraud simultaneously with security in place to escort them out 
 their access to tools and networks will be disabled as of notification 
 union stewards will be informed simultaneously and will be present to offer counsel and explain arbitration procedures to ensure they get due representation 
 personnel effects will be boxed and mailed 
 we intend to separately file civil suits seeking damages legal fees and <unk> damages but in the interest of not clogging the courts legal will show good faith when discussing potential settlements '' 
 & gt judge : termination procedures are one thing but the danger to the public good you argued caused by the information your staff has access to is another 
 i offer advisory that the corporation reviews it 's internal procedures to <unk> potential future harm as we 've determined that too many employees had access to potentially powerful tools that were not strictly necessary to do their jobs 
 anything else before we proceed '' 
 & gt gpa : yes your honor 
 the termination procedure described was very specific mentioned union stewards and arbitration procedures 
 what exactly will happen to non-union personnel who are equally suspected of the same offense on this list 
 we would argue that all must be held to a single standard if fraud indeed occurred '' 
 & gt ecl : we continue to hold full confidence that if any non-union professionals engaged in such practices it 'll be in extreme <unk> '' 
 & gt judge : counsel will provide an answer to the question actually asked '' 
 & gt ecl : ... i assume we would have to apply severe disciplinary procedures to these <unk> we can not really tolerate fraud at any level but the final decisions would lay with the relevant direction '' 
 & gt judge : that is a big change of tone compared to the previous statement the court truly hopes this is not evidence of bad faith 
 we have not mandated police resources and taken <unk> surveillance measures for what increasingly appears to be a witch-hunt against unionized employees 
 the corporation will provide notification to local police the court and the union of what disciplinary measures or legal charges have been brought forward against each person on the list in addition to security improvements we have discussed within 90 days or may face consequences for wrongful proceedings and contempt 
 i am allowing into these proceedings the lawyers of the union whom are to be read into the gag order and events so far to assist or replace at their <unk> gpa 
 they will be equally bound to secrecy towards their own structure and the court no longer believes their presence <unk> a security risk 
 you will understand my mood better in a moment 
 <unk> provide counsel with copies of the police reports 
 we will <unk> until new counsel has been read in '' 
 what i would not have given to be a little bird in the window looking at ecls faces when that union brick dropped on their head and they realized the bulk of the offenders were non-union personnel including managers and a key director 
 union lawyers were horrified to be read into what happened 
 while they could n't yet tell the union what happened they had power of attorney and immediately both drew up suits <unk> everything they could and tacking on <unk> damages 
 they went after them for civil damages for privacy breaches that could get them settlements offenses to union rules like conspiracy to <unk> representation that could get them <unk> rulings in arbitration and breaches of lawyer ethics legal misconduct <unk> <unk> etc that could potentially get ecls <unk> 
 they stopped short of charges that would become criminal as there 's no way to <unk> once it 's in the crown 's hands something the ecls should have thought about in the first place 
 while they could not even tell union management what they were working on as per gpa 's gag order they could legally tell them that their billable hours would go up by an order of magnitude and they needed one extra lawyer which rang huge red alarms 
 the union was on war <unk> 
 this went on for awhile with most everyone still in the dark but <unk> something unusual was going on 
 people in many departments started losing access to tools under new security policies that popped up out of the blue 
 sysadmins could no longer see customer billing files plaintext passwords became harder to access someone in sales could n't use tech <unk> tools anymore frontline staff were no longer allowed to ask for passwords without permission from senior line etc 
 my department is probably one of very few that did n't lose any useful tools 
 as the shadow legal battle began to draw on i 'm fairly certain breaches to the gag orders happened on both sides though it 's impossible to prove 
 the ecls were now <unk> directly with the union 's lawyers and everything suggests they were blinking hard on firing everyone they wanted a deal but they had opened a pandora 's box they could n't close 
 the police report suggesting likely fraud meant that crown could very well bring charges of it 's own and the corporation was now vulnerable legally to things like contempt or obstruction of justice if they did a <unk> so they ultimately just did it 
 they fired everyone unionized or not 
 only the person in each couple who was lying about their address was fired not their so except in the case of the two union reps they fired them both which was completely <unk> - one of them got their job back and significant damages in arbitration 18 months later but the rest all lost fallen in the field of a <unk> battle 
 the promised civil suits for damages all <unk> as the company had no desire to go hard after their lost managers which they hardly wanted to let go in the first place and they had to demonstrate equal treatment 
 they clearly helped them land equivalent jobs at other companies while playing <unk> with our own 
 ultimately the final tally was 7 union down 12 non-union 
 some of them were good friends 
 no criminal charges were filed by the crown 
 there was a big <unk> at legal awhile later because the counter suits our lawyers filled had clear merits in many cases and had to be horse <unk> for things they had no desire to give 
 this is a bit weird but it 's how it happens 
 whenever one side is losing a suit too badly it more often ends up settled with related changes to the work contract the other side wanted rather than actually risking rulings with huge damages 
 in the end it 's fairly obvious that the company came to understand the president and legal had gone in way too hard and the common sense idea of simply warning everyone that this had to end would have been much better 
 - tl : dr <unk> - the ecl 's hopes to focus on the union backfired as more non-union were doing it 
 the court understood what was going on and brought in union lawyers 
 they forced the company to update it 's policies 
 sadly they had painted into such a corner they had to fire everyone even once they no longer wanted to 
 our own lawyers made multiple gains when fighting back but we could only save one of the 8 union fallen on the field because it was really deemed to be fraud in the end 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 long time lurker first post yadda yadda ... this might actually be one of the first stories of my tech support live even though i technically do n't work in tech support 
 20 years ago i was the proud owner of a <unk> amiga 500 <unk> ram and no <unk> 
 so every program or game had to be booted from floppy disk and the floppy drive was loud 
 i was spending the weekend at my <unk> place when my dad called 
 i was 11 or so at that time dad : hey <unk> i want to write a letter but somehow that program wo n't work 
 me : what does n't work 
 dad : i ca n't find the symbol that starts the word processor *i really ca n't remember the <unk> me : okay what have you done since you started it 
 dad : nothing 
 *of course* me : can you please restart the amiga so i can guide you to the program 
 dad restarts the amiga and i can hear the floppy drive working 
 *brrrr tic tic tic tic tic <unk> tic tic <unk> tic tic ... * me : eh dad 
 i think you inserted the wrong disk 
 dad : what 
 do n't mess with me how do you want to know that 
 me : trust me it 's the wrong disk 
 dad : if you 're trying to make fun of me- me : just remove the disk and tell me what 's on the label 
 dad : eh ... workbench '' me : yeah that 's the wrong one 
 you need amiga word '' <unk> sure on that one* i hear him searching through the disks and inserting a disk 
 *brrrr tic tic <unk> brrp brrp tic tic ... * me : yeah that 's the one 
 dad : wtf 
 the screen is still blank how can you know that 
 me : i can hear it 
 dad : *silence* - ah okay i see the symbol now that i usually click on when i use that program 
 me : glad i could help bye 
 i hear <unk> muttering before he hangs up 
 -- -- and that 's the story of how i learned to diagnose computer problems by ear 
 it was later <unk> by the blinking <unk> of activity leds 
 part of me misses the time when <unk> were louder 
 with all this <unk> ssd stuff my <unk> powers are less useful 
 **tl dr : ** every disk has its own <unk> edit : typos edit 2 : found a video of an actual floppy loading on a <unk> time posting but wo n't be my last 
 so first a little background 
 i work in an it support center for a college as a part-time employee and work at an it repair center full-time 
 i enjoy computers but customers are a whole different story 
 so last week i was at the college and i had to run the phones and take calls 
 something i usually do n't do 
 day goes by then i get a call from the art dept 
 & gt me : hello this is batman from it how can i help you 
 & gt art : well we have the mobile projector in room # ___ and it does n't seem to be working 
 me being the <unk> that i am proceeded with 
 & gt me : well have you tried plugging in the projector cart 
 & gt art : one sec ... *plugs in <unk> & gt art : well that 's new but now it 's working 
 thanks 
 *hangs up* & gt me : <unk> head on <unk> am a network engineer for an msp and we handle a number of clients 
 being on the engineering team i rarely field phone calls but we were <unk> one day so i was back in the <unk> 
 i received a phone call from $ user who is unable to access their files on the shared drive 
 keep in mind that this location is in another country canada and does n't have the same procedures as the us branches 
 i then proceeded to do basic troubleshooting 
 i quickly come to the conclusion that they have gotten some sort of <unk> as all of the files even shortcuts have the .vvv '' extension 
 interestingly the file last modified dates were all <unk> 
 even more interestingly there were two sets of the <unk> files one of which with a .vvv extension 
 huh 
 so that means that the entire volume was not encrypted once but twice 
 i informed $ user of the situation promptly disabled the <unk> share <unk> the entire directory and began restoring from our daily backups of which we <unk> backups from up to 3 years ago 
 $ user was very understanding as this is n't the first time this has happened at this location 
 in fact it was the 5th in under a year 
 i 've recommended that the entire staff there be submitted for it safety training and we 're pushing through a phishing test as well 
 i found the users responsible and shut their machines down remotely followed quickly by a phone call telling them to ship the machines back to corporate for reimaging 
 how no one there noticed that all of the files on their shared drive were encrypted for 3 months is beyond me 
 this was supposedly a business critical <unk> a lot of employees have been here for a long time 
 decades even 
 but annie has been here for over 40 years 
 i don’t know how old she is but if i had to guess i would say around <unk> she recently <unk> cancer and has recovered although she walks around the office a little bit more slowly now 
 on the week before christmas she left a big box of chocolate covered cookies on the table in it and a card on each of our desks 
 each one had a $ 25 gift card 
 the morning we came in and saw all this the helpdesk specialist and i ran out to <unk> and got her a plant with some red <unk> and a card that had a dove shaped <unk> xmas <unk> on the front 
 inside it said “may peace be with you in your life and <unk> or something to that effect 
 we left them on her desk when she wasn’t there 
 she came downstairs later that morning with tears in her eyes and thanked us and told us how thankful she was to have us in her life 
 the story would be over at this point but it turns out she had a favor to ask of someone in it and i turned out to be the one she asked 
 she needed a voice-mail pulled off her phone and she didn’t have the slightest idea how to do that 
 as she gave her old flip phone to me she said “what you’re doing will mean a whole lot to <unk> i wondered what she meant 
 i got some free time later that day and i dialed voice-mail 
 the first one was <unk> 
 that did n't seem like the one 
 the next one started and i suddenly knew this was the one she was referring to 
 as it started playing i could hear some quiet music in the background 
 then a man started talking in an old tired sounding voice “i love you baby i love you anne 
 and thank you for everything you’ve ever done for me and are still doing for me 
 i don’t know if i’ll ever be able to <unk> you 
 just to be the man that you know i that you want me to be 
 that’s all i can promise you 
 but i’m ok. ok. i just want to let you know i’m safe 
 i love you goodnight <unk> whether he was addressing annie or some other anne i don’t know 
 all i know is that she said it would make a woman very happy and after i recorded with my iphone and burned it to two cds one data and one music annie said that i did make someone very happy 
 she said that the man in the voice-mail was <unk> husband who died and this voice-mail on her phone was the last time his wife ever heard his voice 
 the next day there was a visa gift card for $ 100 on my desk 
 i bought a <unk> style <unk> lamp with a stained glass shell 
 i even bought the bulbs and had amazon gift wrap it 
 i left it on her desk 
 i spent $ 95 on it and kept $ 5 for myself 
 she sent me an email the next day : <unk> good morning 
 thank you for the beautiful gift 
 i will always cherish the light 
 it is a <unk> <unk> - i will use during <unk> 
 <unk> love and light to you and your success 2015 love a everyone once in a while i 'll put on my best doctor cox impersonation and call a junior engineer by a girls name then go on some stupid little rant 
 it 's all in good fun and enough people have seen scrubs or a <unk> <unk> that they get the joke quickly and we all get a good laugh 
 this morning was just another one of those days but i 'm actually quite proud of it myself 
 i 've noticed recently that our monitoring company is quite lazy 
 they handle all alerts and tickets that occur between 6pm and 7am but if an alert were to be triggered at say <unk> they will hold that ticket until 7 and then send it up to us to be worked 
 their main problem is that they actually forward the original alert to us and it 's timestamped so i know what they 're up to 
 i woke up a bit early this morning and saw this very thing happen 
 i checked the site to see that it was already back up and saw that the circuit had came back up 12 minutes before he bothered to send the alert 
 after all he had to wait for the cutoff time so he did n't have to work on it 
 i shot an email back telling this guy that it was his issue and he needed to work on it but an email argument went back and forth for a few minutes before my boss put an end to that 
 he asked me if i could prove my point i said yes and he had an emergency conference call and <unk> so i could do just that 
 everyone <unk> in i was surprised we had 11 people on a call at 9am with less than 10 minutes notice and i 'm made <unk> 
 i quickly login into the device and show that the last flap up was 12 minutes before the alert was sent to us 
 the guy was sitting there saying that it was down and i looked at the user logs to see that he was logged in shortly after the flap and was still logged in when the alert was emailed 
 everyone saw my screen as i 'm highlighting this part of the log files 
 for some reason doctor cox came out ... & gt <unk> <unk> <unk> ... what do we have here 
 it appears that the little princess here knew damn well what was going on but was too lazy to find a root cause 
 you see logs are like hips <unk> 
 they just do n't lie 
 i do n't think i 've heard so much laughter in an emergency morning meeting in my entire career 
 so i was settling down to go to bed one night around <unk> when my phone rings 
 my boss tells me that he is having an email emergency '' 
 i tell him politely that he is shit out of luck because there is no way i am coming in that late at night and to wait until the next morning 
 i wake up to about 12 texts and a voicemail that are basically i fixed the problem '' the problem is back '' when are you coming in 
 please hurry '' 
 now let me be clear this guy has an email emergency '' on a monthly basis but it was n't until i got to the text saying he would pay me a $ 100 bonus if i fixed the problem before noon that i took his request seriously 
 if he was willing to throw in an extra hundred bucks there is probably a real problem 
 so i rush to get to the office around 9:30 and my boss is frantically typing on his computer 
 he tells me that he thinks client emails are n't coming through so he has been sending himself constant test emails and none of them are coming through either 
 i sit down and check all of the usual suspects 
 account settings were right across all his devices the network was fine i sent a couple of test emails and they came through fine 
 i asked him to send a test email to himself because i wanted to see if the server was bouncing them back for some reason 
 it was at this point i realised what the problem was 
 he was typing in his own email address incorrectly which is <unk> @ <unk> 
 he had been sending dozens of emails with the subject line test '' to someone else all <unk> morning 
 i informed him of the typo and he just kind of stood there contemplating the fact that he <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 ** turns out he was n't missing emails it was just a slow email day 
 he gave me the $ 100 out of sheer <unk> 
 tl dr : boss thinks he is n't getting emails tries sending emails to himself 
 does n't get the test emails calls me late at night repeatedly 
 he was typing his own email address wrong paid me $ 100 to fix a typo 
 just a short one here 
 at my school had to fix an issue with a teachers personal laptop 
 turns out she was on leave 
 call her up and ask for a screen shot 
 she says she will mail it to me 
 find a pdf file in my mail 
 thinking nothing of it i open it to find out that the teacher scanned her monitor and sent the pdf 
 i think there is a face shaped dent in my desk from where my face hit it 
 edit : the <unk> holy shit this blew up previous friday - early afternoon a raging storm outside echoed my mood after i got back from the legal department after an hour of arguing about bills 
 everyone wanted a fight today 
 the phone on my desk started to ring 
 i looked down at it <unk> i was hoping for a quiet nap 
 <unk> phone 
 & gt sassy : it 
 someone 's stolen my screen 
 & gt me : what 
 & gt sassy : i was sending an email then i realized 
 someone had stolen my screen 
 i tried to stifle another yawn it brought the taste of <unk> tea back to my mouth 
 i almost <unk> 
 & gt me : how did they steal a screen mid email 
 how 's that even possible 
 did you see them walk off with it 
 & gt sassy : no stupid 
 they did n't steal it <unk> i was typing the email 
 i realized they had stolen it <unk> typing an email 
 i 'm not sure if it was just my <unk> but my mind could n't make sense what sassy was saying 
 & gt me : okay go back a few steps 
 you turned on your computer you could see the login screen 
 & gt sassy : of course i could see it 
 how else would i log on 
 & gt me : okay so you had the screen when you logged on 
 then you started typing your email and ... & gt sassy : no 
 i do n't think it was there when i logged on 
 i 'm not sure though 
 i only noticed when i started my email 
 i was <unk> confused and very tired 
 & gt me : so did you see it when you logged on 
 & gt sassy : no 
 & gt me : but you said ... & gt sassy : listen to when i 'm saying 
 i logged on 
 i started typing my email then i realized the screen was gone 
 i sat confusedly at my desk 
 my head was spinning 
 & gt me : okay ... & gt sassy : well what are you going to do about it 
 i ca n't work under these conditions 
 & gt me : yes i imagine working without a screen would be hard 
 okay can you borrow another computer while we sort out where your screen went 
 & gt sassy : why would i 
 every other computer here is the same as mine at the moment 
 a whole department 's worth of screens had gone missing 
 i had a sinking feeling 
 & gt me : wait 
 there are no screens in marketing 
 none at all 
 & gt sassy : no 
 there are heaps of screens but none of the spare computers have double screens which is what i want 
 & gt me : oh 
 double screens 
 of course 
 my tired head hit the desk 
 i wanted sleep 
 & gt sassy : so 
 & gt me : i 'll sort it out monday 
 for today you 'll have to make do with a single screen 
 & gt sassy : but i need to type an email ... **click** silence 
 lovely silence 
 ***** the silence lasted about thirty seconds 
 i heard screaming 
 & gt redcheer : <unk> 
 what the hell have you done 
 ** i got up off my chair with a sigh 
 getting to my door the entire it staff were frozen 
 redcheer was furious standing at her desk 
 hesitant was standing at the door to the department <unk> in water a confused look on his face 
 & gt hesitant : what 
 & gt redcheer : i ca n't believe you you little s # % t 
 i too wore an expression similar to hesitant 's 
 total confusion 
 pantsuit looked shocked and turned to redcheer 
 & gt pantsuit : is this true ... 
 pantsuit pointed down at her email 
 i walked back to my computer two emails sat in my inbox both sent company wide 
 & gt **new email** please disregard last email 
 i sent it to the wrong group 
 -- redcheer it 
 & gt **new email** vp & gt i cant wait too see you again your house is so much nicer then mine 
 thanks again for cheering me up the other day by bringing cake to it 
 that felt special 
 -- your red devil redcheer 
 my mouth was wide open 
 i walked back out to the department redcheer was furious 
 she was busy shouting at hesitant who remained oddly calm & gt redcheer : you did this ... & gt hesitant : how could i 
 **you** just sent me off to fix the vp 's new pda which could n't connect to the other building 's wifi and since he apparently was incapable of typing in the password himself i had to run out through the rain to go do it myself 
 i only just got back 
 i have n't been near a computer 
 redcheer was so mad she was speechless 
 i was trying to stifle a yawn 
 pantsuit looked like every christmas had come at once 
 & gt pantsuit : do n't worry redcheer 
 whoever sent it also sent a please disregard the previous email 
 so no-one will read it 
 pantsuit was trying to keep a straight face and not laugh 
 a knock at the door of it drew everyone 's attention 
 standing behind hesitant the shadowed figure of the vp 
 next previous & gt me : how is this <unk> & gt defiant : let me have a look 
 i stared down frustrated at the laptop 's warning 
 an annoyed hr worker stood beside me chocolate <unk> all over his face 
 **the power adapter type can not be determined 
 please plug in a manufactures power adapter to charge the <unk> & gt chocolate : see 
 the battery does n't charge if you unplug it… <unk> 
 computer turns off 
 & gt me : where is your power adapter 
 chocolate handed me the power adapter 
 it was the correct type and in good condition 
 & gt defiant : maybe its a settings problem 
 defiant then started searching deep in the power settings 
 i knew it was n't a settings problem though but i did n't have the heart to tell defiant he seemed so happy looking through settings 
 & gt chocolate : it 's really frustrating 
 every time i bump the power cord out i lose all my work 
 & gt defiant : i ca n't see a problem with the settings 
 must be that the adapter is <unk> 
 i smiled as defiant had come to the correct solution 
 i started to wrap the cords of the power adapter so we could replace it but it was pulled from my grasp by defiant 
 & gt defiant : do n't worry though… i know how to fix it 
 <unk> & gt chocolate : oh 
 good 
 i like fast 
 i opened my mouth to object but defiant had already run off 
 he returned moments later 
 & gt me : defiant pass me that power adapter 
 it needs replacing 
 & gt defiant : no no do n't worry 
 it 's already fixed 
 defiant bent down and plugged in the computer 
 it <unk> to life and the battery started charging 
 & gt chocolate : woah 
 it 's already working 
 & gt defiant : see… defiant smiled up at me 
 i was dismayed at the surprising success 
 dismayed and <unk> & gt me : how did you… & gt defiant : it 's like you with the <unk> a magic touch 
 very suspicious 
 & gt me : what did you do to it 
 & gt defiant : a magician never reveals his <unk> <unk> suspicious 
 & gt me : what happens if i need to fix another one and you 're not here 
 defiant smiled and thought carefully for a moment 
 & gt defiant : fair point 
 okay i 'll tell you 
 the other day i was here in hr i noticed a laptop over in the corner which never gets used 
 it had the same charger 
 i just swapped them 
 & gt me : … 
 suspicion confirmed 
 the silence reigned for a moment as my mind collected everything that was wrong with defiant 's fix '' 
 defiant started getting nervous under my gaze 
 & gt defiant : what 
 everyone wins 
 chocolate 's computer is working and we can get on with more interesting things 
 & gt me : defiant 
 this is **not** everyone wins 
 think for a second what happens when someone else uses that charger 
 & gt defiant : then we have to come up again 
 plus if it 's after hours you might even get double time 
 triple win 
 defiant seemed to be in an <unk> mood 
 i however was not 
 & gt me : that charger was n't working right however it was *still* pushing out some power… which means something in that adapter is eating up *some* of the output power 
 if that part instead of <unk> failing that part decides to fail completely it 'll either catch fire or explode 
 now who wins then 
 & gt defiant : oh 
 defiant looked slightly <unk> chocolate however picked up the argument 
 & gt chocolate : i thought no one uses that computer though… & gt me : <unk> & gt chocolate : yep 
 & gt me : shut up 
 as we walked away broken power adapter in hand defiant looked sad 
 i thought about <unk> him but decided against it 
 & gt defiant : do you have to prove me wrong all the time 
 why not just tell me to shut it like chocolate 
 & gt me : i do n't really care what chocolate thinks about it 
 a faint smile let me know defiant understood 
 next previous wednesday afternoon i was staring at a screen that seemed impossible 
 it had hung on the logo of the company that made the computer 
 bios error 
 & gt sassy : it just sits like that for hours 
 i was hammering f1 - <unk> the delete button enter 
 nothing seemed to be responding 
 & gt me : not ideal 
 i looked around marketing office 
 all the other computers seemed to be working properly 
 perfectly even 
 & gt sassy : since i’m now so far behind in my work can you tell my supervisor i can’t do anything today 
 & gt me : you only submitted a ticket 10 minutes ago 
 i looked at the clock in the corner of the room 
 it was almost three 
 & gt sassy : yeah but… i’ve been troubleshooting for hours 
 even before it broke 
 i deserve the rest of the day off 
 & gt me : wait **you** were troubleshooting 
 i looked upon the screen with a new found <unk> 
 poor thing 
 & gt sassy : i was on the phone to people that make the computer for ages 
 we were updating and moving <unk> 
 & gt me : specifically what did you update 
 & gt sassy : files 
 folders 
 i <unk> 
 ask the computer manufacturer guy 
 i’m too tired for all this questioning 
 sassy’s demeanour <unk> logic 
 i was tempted to just revoke all computer privileges but alas it is meant to help 
 i tried turning it off and on a few times 
 holding down various keys 
 sassy got more and more impatient as i worked 
 & gt sassy : can i like… go 
 home now 
 & gt me : unfortunately its only 3 o’clock 
 do you remember what things you moved around 
 or anything you tried to update 
 she looked at me and <unk> out slowly 
 & gt sassy : <unk> <unk> 
 it doesn’t feel like three though 
 feels more like home time 
 right 
 & gt me : no .. just… 
 bios 
 did you see the word bios anywhere 
 i was feeling pretty frustrated at this point 
 sassy didn’t seem to care 
 & gt sassy : you’re talking like that guy 
 on the phone 
 he just said stuff needed updating okay 
 so he pointed me to the site and i <unk> accidentally hung up on him .. so i just decided to install everything 
 & gt me : you went to computer manufacturers site and decided to install everything 
 sassy got up and started walking away 
 & gt me : where are you going 
 sassy turned around slowly 
 & gt sassy : feels like home time 
 & gt me : just sit down 
 now did you install everything from that site 
 & gt sassy : yes and i thought that would fix it but the darn thing just kept popping up with boxes and boxes 
 it took <unk> long 
 i worked hard on getting through all of it 
 i waited patiently for her to continue 
 after a great pause she decided to keep going 
 & gt sassy : i read all of it pressed all the right buttons worked my fingers to the <unk> 
 then right as i thought maybe it would all work out and i could continue my work day 
 <unk> it starts just… restarting 
 over and over 
 i just wanted to get back to work but it wouldn’t let me 
 eventually i gave up unplugged it 
 i tried turning it on normally and then it just … stopped 
 & gt me : you… unplugged it while it was restarting 
 oh darn it all 
 & gt sassy : see what i’ve had to put up with all day 
 just madness 
 now can i please 
 please 
 go home 
 my mouth was wide open 
 i could not believe it 
 this was just… 
 i wanted to be angry i wanted to cry i wanted to at least be shocked 
 instead i just smiled and quietly packed up the computer 
 & gt sassy : so… can i go 
 & gt me : talk to your manager 
 & gt sassy : you’re a manager 
 i gave sassy my best one thousand yard stare 
 & gt me : no 
 talk to *your* manager 
 sassy gave a huff 
 & gt sassy : <unk> … don’t have to be sassy about it 
 <unk> 
 next this is by far my best and most memorable story while working at a computer repair company 
 a middle aged woman dropped her daughters laptop off because it was n't working ... or to be more accurate was so plagued with viruses the hard drive should 've been take out back and shot 
 i spent some time going over it and gave her a call to let her know a backup format and reinstall would be the best course of action 
 she declined because it would cost <unk> ~ $ <unk> and said she 'd be back in the morning to collect 
 she came in to pick up but needed to leave again so she could get some cash for our <unk> ~ $ 7 minimum labour fee 
 that was the last i saw of her for 7 months 
 out of the blue she came into the store to to collect the laptop but we had <unk> it as store policy was that if a pc or laptop is <unk> after 6 months we <unk> it or scrap it 
 i informed her of what had happened and she and her daughter left but she would be back in the morning with her desktop which was not turning on 
 true to her word she <unk> the next day with a her pc in tow wrapped up in several black bin bags 
 she informed me that it had stopped working after her son had borrowed it for the weekend and she had been trying to get it to turn on with no success 
 okay does n't sound too major may just be a blown power supply 
 i checked it in and because i still had a lot on my plate that morning put it on the shelf and would get round to it later in the day 
 a few hours later ... as the mid afternoon rolls in it 's time to see what 's wrong with this machine 
 i start cutting through the several layers of <unk> black bin bags wondering what kind of horrors i 'm about to come across when i finally reach the case 
 first thing i notice is that the side panels are loose 
 interesting what 's happened here then 
 i pull the tower from its <unk> and it quickly becomes obvious why this thing is n't working 
 it had been <unk> 
 <unk> except for the dvd drive had been removed and was nowhere to be found 
 after about 5 minutes of laughing i summon the other techs to see if they can <unk> me any assistance in figuring out why this pc is n't turning on 
 they look at it in disbelief after i tell them it 's not a joke and was a legitimate customer who brought it in and we all had a good laugh about it 
 grant called the lady up because he wanted to be the one to tell her that the computer she brought in was n't a computer any more and that she should probably have a good chat with her son 
 she picked it up the next day free of charge albeit angry 
 to this day i still wonder what she was trying to plug the power cord into 
 **tl dr : ** customer did n't know why her <unk> pc was n't turning on 
 this is n't a story about me but one from an uncle i love who was <unk> knowledgeable about technology back in his day 
 <unk> to black and white 
 ** this tale occurs in the early <unk> 
 everyone always called him joe since he was born back when it was cool to name at least a few of your kids <unk> 
 joe did all sorts of work when he was young 
 he got his education studying to be a priest but decided he liked girls and booze a little too much to go through with it then he went on to be a <unk> an accountant a <unk> volunteer worked a gig at what passed as a startup back then - learning everything about punch cards 
 they went <unk> and then he became a road tech for a tiny company pulling copper wire all over a city where there was simply no cable network 
 this tiny company would ultimately become part of the telco i work for today 
 after having worked in the field awhile his accounting experience landed him a <unk> gig in a <unk> and <unk> department that essentially did everything hr payroll and <unk> do here today 
 it 's difficult to fathom but over 40 years ago things were incredibly different 
 he told me tales about how back then a simple <unk> employee could make decisions that today could only be made by the board of directors after the evil corporate lawyers signed on with a <unk> 
 but this tale is about the day he was asked to choose between two technical solutions to help the company get into the computing age early 
 he had a boss who wanted into the computing era early 
 perhaps too early 
 & gt 1970sboss : we 're looking at ibm 's new 128 column card and at hollerith 's card 
 i know ibm has more capacity they are <unk> but since you did some work in that field i 'd like your input before i turn in paper '' 
 & gt joe : er sure let 's start by what they 're going to be used for '' 
 & gt 1970sboss : well that should be obvious 
 we want to <unk> - if we do it early we beat our competition 
 the goal is to put *everything* related to accounting and hr on those 
 the vp is in i have a large budget 
 payroll will have everything on cards it 'll be so efficient we 'll make major gains 
 but i do want to know which is the best solution so i asked three employees - including you - with expertise in the field which to pick 
 can you look at it and get back to me by friday '' 
 joe was silent a moment and nodded 
 came friday 
 the first employee was a strong <unk> of ibm 's card even though it cost more 
 the second argued that there were many flaws with this card and that most people saw it as a 96 rather than 128 column card because there were huge issues reading the 4th row and suggested hollerith 's 
 joe came in with a huge box filled with paper 
 a secretary was helping him cause it was too heavy for one person 
 on top of the box was an ibm punch card and an hollerith card 
 & gt joe : first i 'd like to congratulate ibm on their momentum even though it 's overpriced and there are some issues they did slightly expand on what you can do with a punch card right now 
 but i 'm not exactly here to recommend buying either '' 
 he removed both cards from his <unk> and put a relatively thin stack of paper next to them 
 & gt joe : that small stack of paper is the amount of data you can store on the best punch card that exists right now i triple checked 
 it wo n't be this way forever but right now it 's the best money can buy 
 tons of great uses for them anyway 
 what they may not be so useful for is storing accounting data 
 the huge box next to these that i only pulled a single folder from 
 that 's just the data from the last quarter from the <unk> health board regarding work-related injuries a rather small <unk> of the stuff accounting deals with '' 
 & gt 1970sboss : huh 
 so what 's your point 
 we should look into a different card '' 
 & gt joe : there 's nothing to be gained by trying to move our accounting to punch cards right now 
 in fact i can get through that paper stack in a week but if i had the same data on punch cards i 'd still be making excuses a month from now 
 i 'm sure punch cards will get better more data in less space 
 but right now 
 nobody in my department - me least of all - thinks it would help any 
 not for the kind of work we do 
 wait till the technology <unk> before making this kind of investment '' 
 the old boss dismissed him but ultimately they chose not to go ahead right away with the punch cards 
 just a few years later once early computing was becoming actually efficient for the kind of work they needed they went all in early and joe approved at the time 
 it paid off in <unk> 
 had they blown their money on <unk> cards they might have been late on the industry rather than <unk> 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 previous walking near the vp is always a problem he doesn’t seem to enjoy silence 
 & gt vp : so… how are you going is it all good 
 & gt me : yep 
 good 
 i tried to get out of sync with the vp’s footsteps but the vp continually managed to get back in sync 
 we looked like we were <unk> 
 & gt vp : why are you taking my computer away again 
 it’s so fast now 
 & gt me : unauthorized access 
 & gt vp : can’t we just ask what the boy did 
 then if it was just a <unk> … leave it because it is at least twice as fast at the moment 
 & gt me : oh we’ll ask him 
 still its better to just wipe and start again though 
 <unk> that way 
 i <unk> stepped a few times 
 the vp ignored it and somehow end up in sync within a second 
 it was almost impressive 
 & gt vp : how long will it take 
 & gt me : a few hours 
 max 
 i’ll get you a loaner laptop for the interim 
 the vp looked thoughtful 
 he seemed to toss up the options in his head 
 & gt vp : no don’t worry 
 i’ll just wait 
 & gt me : oh 
 are you sure 
 & gt vp : it’ll be fine 
 in fact i probably don’t even need a computer anymore 
 & gt me : er 
 okay 
 it’ll only be a few hours i suppose 
 we arrived at his office and i started unplugging his desktop 
 he sat down at his desk and started looking thoughtful 
 & gt vp : airz 
 do me a favor take the screen off my desk 
 i placed the screen on the floor 
 the vp <unk> tossed the keyboard and mouse over at the floor next to me 
 <unk> missing my head 
 & gt vp : oh my… the vp spread his arms out over the desk 
 running them smoothly across the now empty surface 
 & gt vp : my desk 
 its so big 
 i had successfully unplugged the desktop and stood up to leave 
 desktop in hand 
 & gt vp : airz 
 wait 
 you forgot to take the screen 
 & gt me : we’ve got screens downstairs for the install 
 & gt vp : no take it now 
 so you don’t have to do a double trip 
 & gt me : taking it isn’t required 
 you’ll need it again when your desktop comes back 
 the vp looked taken a back 
 he had <unk> in horror 
 & gt vp : comes back 
 no 
 no 
 no 
 have you seen what my desk looks like without a computer <unk> things up 
 it’s so smooth 
 so nice 
 i don’t think i’ll require the desktop back 
 & gt me : … you don’t want your computer back 
 the idea sounded suspicious 
 i didn’t know if i should be overjoyed or worried 
 & gt vp : no 
 i think i’m better off without one 
 a vp’s computer can’t do much 
 & gt me : but you’ve access to every department… the vp’s face looked determined 
 & gt vp : i’ve decided 
 this office looks better without a computer 
 & gt me : <unk> okay 
 i guess you won’t be seeing much of it anymore then 
 i walked over and attempted to <unk> the screen and desktop in two hands 
 it was too much 
 the vp was smiling 
 & gt vp : don’t worry 
 i’ll still be connected 
 the vp waved a little box in the air 
 it contained a new pda 
 i then realized the vp would now solely <unk> on a pda 
 f @ % $ 
 next this comment reminded me i had to post this tale 
 when i 'm not working from home my office is in a tall <unk> 
 underneath it is a parking lot 
 underneath that is a core headend that 's supposed to be able to survive a direct nuclear strike built to specs in the 80s based on what the government thought would most likely be <unk> our way in case of an all-out soviet first strike 
 few years ago we were in technology <unk> tests for wifi repeaters 
 the end goal was to ensure that every customer who brought or rented one of our routers would have perfect coverage in their entire homes no matter how vast 
 it 's another <unk> <unk> that upper management really wanted us to push 
 orders come down from the office of the president to road techs manglement 
 as a test they 're supposed to get those to work in multiple locations including some headends where this would be most challenging 
 but <unk> is behind <unk> of concrete and heavy metal doors made out of some obscure <unk> supposed to survive soviet <unk> no wifi will ever get through 
 & gt bytewave : senior line bytewave you may send ... '' & gt road manglement : patching you to our most senior road tech input required 
 apparently something ca n't be done 
 i 'm told you 're the department to call when this happens '' 
 well i 'm a tiny bit vain and he <unk> the right buttons 
 let 's make miracles happen.. as he explains the situation my first answer is well you 're pretty fucked but it 's not your fault '' 
 there 's zero ways to get a <unk> to work past blast doors 
 but then again it 's a damn core headend the entire <unk> works only because of this 
 blast proof or not there 's connectivity 
 & gt bytewave : so the real goal of the exercise is to demonstrate the ability of the repeaters themselves or your department 's ability to get a signal in tough to reach locations '' 
 & gt senior roadtech : in theory who knows but really - the latter 
 my boss made that very clear 
 unlike pretty much everything else about this thing '' 
 & gt bytewave : yeah you were right when you told your boss to call us to back up the fact it ca n't be done 
 it ca n't 
 but i might have an idea to impress the wide ties 
 union <unk> for upper management fiber <unk> are going in and out of this headend no matter how much concrete was poured 
 i do n't know where but you do 
 there 's always an entry and an exit 
 have the repeaters get to the entry point go through the existing wiring and then on the other side set up the repeaters to give total coverage - generously assuming you need more than one in there '' 
 & gt senior roadtech : well that 's obvious cheating they 'll figure it out in no time '' 
 & gt bytewave : really you worked for the same union i do for decades and you still think they 'll figure it out 
 the only thing to figure out is the fact they handed down an assignment that 's physically impossible 
 now you can skirt the rules or just say i confirmed it 's indeed impossible either way i got no skin in this particular crazy game beyond this ticket i already closed '' 
 & gt senior roadtech : ... why not give it a try 
 from what i gathered they really want wifi to get into this bunker '' 
 and so it happens the bunker 's hard structure is <unk> and they get <unk> coverage in there 
 it goes down to the entry point then though well protected fiber <unk> deep in concrete then wifi again 
 totally cheating but there 's wifi coverage everywhere right 
 weeks later i 'm cc 'd on an email from the secretary of the president thanking everyone for great work and saying the repeaters are moving to <unk> 
 yeah totally a cheat 
 but when you 're given insane directions you do what you can 
 to this day the <unk> of the president still thinks we got repeaters working through blast doors 
 monday midday i’d had enough 
 two audits was too much even for half a day 
 time to call in the big boss 
 as i rang the big boss i wondered how much money was wasted on passed audits in the world 
 with managers like mine probably all of it 
 & gt boss : airz good morning - ish 
 & gt me : president i was wondering did you know i’m currently under two audits 
 & gt boss : two does seem a little excessive 
 & gt me : two external audits 
 i could hear the boss get mad 
 steam pouring from his ears 
 & gt boss : we aren’t made of money 
 those things aren’t cheap 
 & gt me : <unk> & gt boss : perhaps the vp’s trying to screw everyone 
 two <unk> two 
 auditors cost more then a high class <unk> 
 & gt me : er… & gt boss : don’t worry airz 
 i’ll get rid of one of the auditors 
 just wait at it i’ll send down security to escort them off the premises 
 & gt me : bit <unk> but okay 
 as i waited for security to arrive i got chatting to audit 
 screechy listened on but refused to talk 
 & gt audit : i got ta say airz its been a while since ive seen my nephew work so well 
 he seems happy here 
 just this weekend he said you’d put him in charge of the whole phone roll out 
 & gt me : yeah he’s been working out okay 
 audit smiled 
 he actually seemed okay even if he did prefer tea 
 security arrived shortly after 
 & gt sec : we’re here to escort an auditor off the premises 
 the security guards look between the two auditors 
 & gt sec : say boss 
 which er… 
 auditor do we escort away 
 i looked between the two auditors 
 better the devil you know right 
 & gt me : miss screechy 
 please follow these security guards 
 it was at this point that the security guards mobile rang 
 & gt sec : hello this is security 
 he put the phone on speaker 
 & gt vp : please escort auditor off the premises 
 & gt sec : not miss screechy 
 & gt vp : no 
 auditor 
 the security guards left the room with auditor 
 there i was standing alone next to a person i’d tried to fire 
 and she was my auditor 
 darn 
 next older one idle day at the retail shop i 'm on the sales floor since it 's a bit more pleasant than the shop area 
 one of the <unk> waves me over 
 he 's got a customer looking for an adapter that the <unk> is unfamiliar with 
 salesguy : '' lawtechie 
 this customer is looking for an adapter to connect his playstation to his imac '' me : '' <unk> 
 connect in what way '' 
 customer : '' you know so like the playstation would connect to the imac '' me : '' right 
 what would this look like when we 're done '' 
 customer : '' well you know they 'd be connected '' me : '' yeah 
 you said that 
 would they be networked '' 
 customer : '' would that do it '' 
 me : '' what is it that it would do when we 're done '' 
 customer : '' see i do n't have a tv '' me : '' and you want to view the playstation via your imac 's screen '' customer : '' yeah 
 i did n't see the adapter '' me : '' which imac do you have '' 
 customer : '' the blue one '' me : '' well that model does n't have an external video in port 
 theoretically you could disassemble it plug another <unk> cable into the monitor pin it out to vga on the other end and plug that into your playstation 
 you 'd have to drill a hole in the case and <unk> together some kind of <unk> switch as well '' 
 customer pointing at a wall of various cables and adapters : '' so which adapter is it '' 
 me : '' no such adapter exists 
 this is the first time i 've ever heard of someone wanting to use their imac as an external monitor '' customer : '' so you ca n't just plug it in '' 
 me : '' no 
 what i 'm describing is a day long project <unk> existing hardware to make it do something that apple did n't consider when they designed it '' customer : '' how much would that cost '' 
 me : '' a day 's labor 
 probably $ 800 or so '' customer : '' i ca n't afford that 
 a new tv is only $ 300 '' me : '' that might be a better option for you '' customer : '' you were trying to rip me off '' me : '' no 
 i was trying to explain that what you want is possible even if it 's not cost-effective '' customer : '' you were trying to rip me off 
 i 'm just a poor college student '' long time lurker first post 
 not very interesting story but i have to vent 
 some background : 1 i work for the mayor 's office 
 i am responsible for maintenance and support of all machines in my town 
 2 have three employees : <unk> <unk> and crosseyed 
 the last 2 are interns 
 3 this happened 15 minutes ago 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- most of the time we just have to reinstall some networked printer who went offline for whatever reasons or check why there 's no internet connection usually somebody just turned off the modem <unk> save power but sometimes <unk> get older machines all desktops with users complaining that they are slow 
 normally we just cleanup the dust do a <unk> scan and/or format and reinstall since we do n't use any special software just <unk> 
 not so often we have some spare parts like a better memory or a faster hd and upgrade the machine the best we can 
 so this machine came to us 
 crosseyed pick the ticket and proceed as usual 
 suddenly ... crosseyed : - boss i think this machine came <unk> 
 me : - no the client said it was ok just running slow 
 i know them they 're reliable 
 check again 
 ce : - boss the machine is n't powering on 
 me : - did you checked if the power cable was plugged in 
 because you did this once ... ce : - yeah boss i checked 
 me : - did you checked if it is <unk> or <unk> 
 on their site they have both 
 ce : - yeah 
 me : - strange 
 let me see 
 i go check this poor baby and the first i smell is that sad <unk> of a deep fried motherboard 
 me : - crosseyed come here 
 ce : - 'sup 
 me : - tell me exactly what you did 
 ce : - i cleaned it up ... me : - ... and ... ce : - ... upgraded the ram from <unk> to 2gb ... me : - ... and ... ce : - ... switched the power supply 
 me : - and it was all ok 
 ce : - well it was a little hard to fit but i managed it 
 when i turned it on it smelled burned so i turned it off 
 i had to show him 
 he did those upgrades hundred of times 
 but this time he <unk> 2 things i never saw in my life : he managed to plug a <unk> on a <unk> slot ... and plugged the power supply backwards 
 when it does n't fit he does the one logical thing on his mind and cut the power plug in order to fit 
 **tl dr : crosseyed intern could fit an square <unk> on a round hole 
 ** edit : <unk> the <unk> gb to <unk> time at this subreddit i will definitely have to share what happened today 
 all begins with the most <unk> email title for an issue : subject : fix server asap please fix server so i called this user i asked him to be more specific in what was happening he told me that his applications were not working properly in his <unk> server there was a poor performance making everything partial down and then as he wasn’t the developer he transfer me to this <unk> the star of this story 
 the first time i was talking with this guy he didn’t even say hi or good <unk> first words i heard from him was : & gt user : listen dude let’s make this quickly just sent someone to put more ram in this server with the time our applications got bigger and <unk> we require more memory because we need everything that’s running right now if you provide more ram this will disappear its simple logic you get it 
 & gt deycko : sounds fair but first i have to take a look and make that decision by my own 
 & gt user : dude i just gave you the reason if you install the ram everything is going to be ok. you say you got it 
 & gt deycko : according to system the last time that server was <unk> down was 1 year ago so probably we will have to restart the server and see how it goes after that… your applications are not accessible and are currently down so there is no risk or impact in here 
 & gt user : oh no no no dude no… what’s wrong with you 
 that’s your solution 
 if restarting is your solution i will better call my son and after that your damn manager 
 you can not be serious i refuse to do such thing you have no right to say there is no impact you don’t know nothing 
 at this point i was getting upset but i’m not the kind of guy that shows his anger that easy actually i become more nicely probably in a sarcastic mode but nicely 
 & gt deycko : all right sir i will show you why a restart it’s needed i will connect to your server remotely and… <unk> & gt user : no you can not access to my server that’s my server it has a password that i only know and there is no way i can give you that password 
 & gt deycko : no problem sir if you are using the corporate intranet i don’t need your credentials 
 & gt user : but… just after i was logging into that server i noticed something weird in the task bar there was a process running that was <unk> almost 70 % of the memory and that process was prepare yourselves : <unk> vice <unk> <unk> this douche bag wanted more ram to play videogames in one of the servers of the company he was about to beat the game as i also played it in the past and it was frozen when he was trying to save his progress apparently so that was maybe the reason he was not ok with performing a restart of the server 
 i was shocked this dude was so rude at me because he was playing a game and got freeze 
 deycko : dude are you playing <unk> vice city 
 **user goes <unk> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- **edit** : of course i sent an email to his damn '' manager i told him that his applications were down because his employee was using the server to play videogames and also he was being rude about it 
 i do n't have any response yet 
 i will keep you guys posted 
 **edit 2** : i got answer from his manager : you can be sure we will take this very serious this is totally against our company values and we are going to take the necessary actions 
 thanks for your quick response in our issue '' 
 this is a tale about a tough call 
 when you just do n't know if you 're doing the right thing 
 not so long ago at my telco the <unk> chat - a chatroom for senior staff from all departments at my telco - got a message from internal security the department in charge of contacts with law enforcement and piracy complaints 
 & gt is - l2l3 chat : systems networks - n03-a1b2 to go dark immediately 
 we 'll tell as soon as it can go back up 
 i blinked hard reading that 
 that meant bringing down 1200 devices both cable boxes and <unk> 
 never seen them ask for anything this broad before 
 was n't immediately my call anyhow that 's networks job not senior tech support 
 & gt networks - l2l3 chat : systems ca n't bring nodes down 
 as for us happily 
 forward copy of warrant to <unk> @ telco.ca <unk> will be down in seconds 
 & gt is - l2l3 chat : no warrant 
 bring it down now 
 & gt networks - l2l3 chat : no warrant no outage 
 you know the policy 
 very soon after my emergency line rings 
 i see the caller id 
 is repeats their request 
 i 'd never override networks on their own turf - this is the kind of call <unk> make 
 i troubleshoot issues not create them 
 but though i kept calm it was hard not to worry i was making the wrong call ... & gt bytewave : like they said 
 no warrant no outage 
 i 've been here over a decade and we never ever shut down a node voluntarily without a warrant 
 that 's 1200 modems and <unk> 
 why ca n't we pinpoint something more specific like we usually ... '' & gt is : look we do n't ask this often but this node got ta go dark somehow and quickly 
 i ca n't say why but it matters '' 
 & gt bytewave : okay 
 wrong department technical support senior staff ca n't bring nodes down 
 systems and networks can but will only <unk> '' & gt is : cut the bs 
 this is an emergency 
 i know you have access to their tools n03-a1b2 needs to go dark now '' 
 ... well it 's true tsss loves to collect <unk> and logins we do n't strictly need and i have some i should n't have '' 
 technically i could bring the node down 
 & gt bytewave : just linked this call to the recording software - my boss and hr 's emergency line 
 if you believe anyone 's physical security is at risk you can tell me right now on the record and yes - i will then have n03-a1b2 down within ten seconds even if it 's not my job 
 if not then i 'd like an in-depth explanation why you 're asking the wrong department to create an outage while you ... '' he hung up 
 it 's a fellow union department and i hated to put them under the spotlight but trying to <unk> procedure to get a department that 's not supposed nor trained to handle this kind of emergency responsible for one 
 not under my watch unless you can tell me why 
 the pretext of 'emergencies is routinely abused 
 if you ca n't even tell me what me what the <unk> is wo n't work with me 
 it 's risky but if there 's a real emergency there 's little risk it ends up at tsss 
 the recording was n't cut despite him hanging up 
 & gt bytewave : second party appears to have hung up 
 this is bytewave employee number <unk> 
 no followup on is request 's for lack of warrant nor information <unk> to an immediate threat 
 terminating call '' 
 i was sweating a bit might have been something serious ... did i put someone in danger just to stick to the rules 
 ... almost a minute later ... l2 sales rep - l2l3 chat : false alarm regarding n03-a1b2 
 threat from <unk> customer 
 tv product director on it no action without tvpd orders 
 ... might have just <unk> out but i never knew the full story 
 usually is makes these calls but i could n't think of any reason why they would n't tell me on record it needed to be done 
 much relief when it turned out to be an overblown issue and there was no real danger 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 this is my first story so all of that or whatever 
 this occurred at least ten years ago but probably not more than fifteen years ago 
 so well into the age where folks generally know about email and the <unk> and such 
 the star of our tale today is a $ salesguy 
 as far as i know he was a pretty good sales guy and made a lot of sales but he had quite a few <unk> 
 one of them was he was constantly stomping up to the copy machine to make copies 
 of forms that he insisted on filling out on the old style <unk> forms so it already made four copies when he wrote it 
 i guess he just did n't trust the <unk> staff 
 got ta get that cash 
 his other <unk> included constantly doing a sort of pee pee dance while discussing any topic with anyone 
 not just shifting from one foot to the other but bouncing around a fairly large area jumping and <unk> 
 he also was a blatant personal space <unk> 
 yet another was asking every question three times of everyone with a different <unk> each time as though expecting a different answer 
 on this day we find $ salesguy inside of my tiny cubicle looming over me and getting in my face and taking up the entire area with his strange dance 
 & gt $ salesguy : my emails are not going through to my customer 
 i typed his address in exactly as it was on his business card '' 
 <unk> pee <unk> & gt me : well i 'll take a look 
 what address are you sending to '' 
 & gt $ salesguy : my emails are not going through to my customer 
 i typed it in exactly as it is on his business card '' 
 *more dancing around* & gt me : yes you said that 
 what address are you sending them to '' 
 & gt $ salesguy : my emails are not going through to my customer 
 i typed in his address exactly as it is on his business card '' 
 *now dancing and <unk> wildly around my tiny cubicle as i shrink in my chair* & gt me : yes i am aware that is why you are here 
 can i please know what email address you are attempting to send to '' 
 & gt $ salesguy : <unk> business card an inch in front of my eyes* i graciously accept the business card and bring it far enough from my face so that i can actually read it 
 great this customer 's email address is customer @ customercompany.com & gt me : give me a moment please '' 
 i pull up the logs and search 
 & gt $ salesguy : <unk> and dancing wildly around tiny <unk> this is a really important lead you better fix this '' 
 found it 
 failed deliveries to <unk> @ customercompany.com & gt me : you did n't type it in exactly as it is on the business card 
 there is no www 
 in front of it because it should n't be there for an email address 
 that 's why it 's not on the business card 
 just type it in like it is on the business card '' 
 & gt $ salesguy : <unk> a few times and <unk> <unk> was a new starter looking after a client we had taken over 6 months ago who where having lots of issues the ceo was concerned the old it guy was still accessing the system 
 i thought that was a bit crazy but strange things were happening account lockouts passwords changing services being disabled it really felt like something malicious was happening but i could n't prove anything 
 then it happened 
 one afternoon i was light on work so i decided to log into their system and have a poke around 
 i log onto the terminal server look at active users 
 logged in user - backup holy shit that did n't look right 
 i bring over my coworker who notices that the computer name has the same initials as the company that the old it guy was currently working for 
 we look at his ip and bingo reverse dns shows he is connecting from his old work place 
 reset his password and displayed this message on his session this is an unauthorised connection your ip <unk> has been linked to your domain <unk> and legal action will follow knowing his session was n't idle i let that sit for a nice 5 seconds so he could <unk> in panic and fear then disconnected his session 
 logged in and opened outlook and he had <unk> mailbox connected to his with full permissions we checked his sent items nothing .. i hit recover deleted items '' and hey <unk> 6 months worth of emails he has been forwarding to himself or forwarding to a women in the office who we discover he is having an affair with 
 he is feeding her information from her coworkers and she was using that to her advantage 
 he had forwarded other emails that i had written to the ceo <unk> him the old it guy was not logging in remotely and he had added haha these guys are fucking idiots they have no idea 
 cancelled another backup last night do you think they will figure it out 
 morons '' 
 i could not believe what i was reading 
 i simply can not include all of the incredible things we discovered and the evidence we collected it was the most exciting it work i have ever done in my life 
 it was filled with justice and epic wins 
 **epilogue** the ceo decided to get lawyers involved i provided them with every scrap of data i could find and they put together this intimidating 200 page document that included <unk> lists of connection times showing he basically logged in every day while working at his new job and tampered with the system 
 it stated they would sue him and have him charged if he did not <unk> with the terms of the agreement 
 that document was delivered to him personally at his desk at 9am of a work day and at exactly the same time the exact same document was delivered to his boss at 9am 
 he was escorted out of the building at <unk> 
 edit : epilogue not <unk> <unk> ii : answering some questions <unk> **what happened to the girl 
 ** the ceo decided to review her work and discovered that she had been doing some sabotage as well not putting in sales orders in from people she did n't like deleting messages and saying they were never <unk> and in one more serious incident she edited <unk> <unk> resulting in lost overtime 
 she had to pay the back money owed and lost her job they could have taken legal action but my understanding was it was not a large amount 
 **what where the terms and conditions 
 ** i was n't <unk> to all the details but my client did let me know that he had to attend several <unk> in which he had to answer in great detail everything he had done surrender hard drives and other equipment that he had mentioned he had stolen and there was some kind of financial component to it as well where he had to pay costs of causing all of these issues i think it was in the thousands not a huge amount but for a guy without a job it was 
 there was some provision about not working in it i am not sure how legally that works but i believe he had to stay away from it for 5 or 10 years 
 <unk> are n't an it detective you 're a big <unk> 
 ** yes when taking on a new client all password should be <unk> and the entire system should be reviewed 
 unfortunately i had been working for the company for two weeks they took on the client six months ago 
 i later determined that several factors went into why the system review was n't done time and cost <unk> but mainly laziness 
 my coworkers had already looked into it '' and concluded that he was n't logging in '' and told me a full password <unk> was done later i discovered it was only for real peoples accounts not service accounts 
 when i was given management of the client account manager not it helpdesk guy the ceo gave me a the full story and i began looking into it 
 it should also be said that my job role was account manager i met with clients and discussed the performance of our helpdesk their it agreement and projects - i was not meant to do troubleshooting that was apparently for the helpdesk tier <unk> the jobs that came through to the helpdesk backups cancelled account lockouts were treated by them as isolated issues and did not investigate further than that 
 all of this <unk> into a situation where everyone in my company was telling me its fine and my client is just paranoid 
 i did n't accept that and found what i found 
 did i use any advanced <unk> 
 no 
 the guy was sloppy as shit and anyone who is worth half their salt could have found it 
 i am sharing this story because it 's interesting not because i think i am a detective 
 **what other evidence did you find 
 ** he was a prolific user of <unk> and his chat logs were all stored in his user profile he would chat throughout the day with the woman in the office and have some of the most cringe worthy interactions that were just disturbing to read 
 they had <unk> of red hot anger swearing at each other like two <unk> at a pub followed by <unk> apologies and disgusting make up <unk> 
 constant bitching about others in the office 
 i found that this woman would contact him to fix it issues it explained why she was so hostile towards me when i met her in person 
 several incidents where he was attempting to fix '' something our helpdesk was also looking at the same issue and this <unk> the problems 
 he had accidentally saved some passwords to websites in his browser cache like facebook web management site of his personal domain some other weird forums 
 could n't do anything with these of course but it was hilarious clicking on his history and it loading straight into these sites the audacity and <unk> of this guy thinking he would never get caught yet taking no steps to hide his activity 
 the most disturbing of all though was the m night <unk> twist when i discovered that the old it guy was very close to one of the owners and they had remained in contact after he was let go 
 he had convinced the owner that letting him go was a mistake and to watch how many problems would occur without him 
 he also claimed to be logging in to check on things '' and make sure backups run that kind of thing '' quotes from emails he wrote 
 he was <unk> the system while pretending to fix things saying that if he was n't logging in things would be so much worse 
 the owner believed every word and met with him on several occasions to discuss how to deal with the situation 
 the ceo was furious upon this discovery and went to the other owners who decided to use this opportunity to push him out of the business 
 thanks for reading it tech for a school district 
 ok 
 ok. last week i had a work order from a teacher stating that everyday around <unk> her mouse <unk> would jump to the bottom right corner twitch and <unk> randomly 
 i get to her room to check out her machine 
 the mouse is <unk> normally so i check the usual places for anything unusual e.g 
 installed programs 
 i find a bunch on shady stuff 
 ask toolbar coupon <unk> and <unk> among other things 
 i start <unk> the herd and run <unk> for good measure 
 final score 133 items including 3 <unk> 
 i remove these and tell her to let me know if she has any more trouble 
 today i get an email from her saying that she is still having trouble 
 i try swapping out her mouse thinking that maybe the optical sensor has gone bad 
 <unk> rolls around and she is still having trouble 
 i <unk> <unk> her computer since nothing else seems to be working 
 she agrees and is done for the day so i can get right to it 
 as i 'm backing up her data to google drive she tells me that she has to step out for a bit and will be right back 
 as the door to her classroom closes the mouse starts to have a seizure 
 i look at the door and see that there is a mirror <unk> on it that when opened faces to the west 
 my only thought is no way i move the mouse to the other side of the screen open the door and slowly close it 
 i see light reflected onto the floor and as it lines up with the desk with mouse freaks out again 
 turns out she always has her door open during class 
 tl dr <unk> trick shot from <unk> million miles away manages to give a rodent <unk> 
 part 1 part 2 part 3 i 'm performing it vendor audits for a banking client 
 this particular vendor seems to be special since the bank itself is sending their own compliance people instead of leaving all the work to me 
 i 'm sitting in the director of compliance 's office while he 's trying to <unk> the bank 's compliance people 
 he 's discussing his career as a big corporate lawyer 
 i do n't mention that i 'm a lawyer 
 it 'd only confuse things 
 i 'm here for it things 
 the vendor is a print shop 
 they print statements for the consumer and investment customers so they 're processing a bit of sensitive data for the bank 
 i ask a bunch of questions on how they hold and process data and i get believable straightforward answers 
 just to keep them honest i occasionally ask about the same control from an attacker 's point of view rather than a controls point of view 
 as an example : i stick in a thumb drive into one of the graphics workstations 
 can i download valuable data to it '' 
 i 'm hoping to get them to explain how their controls work together 
 if they do i get the feeling that they 're less about compliance <unk> and instead about actually securing important data 
 this drives the vendor 's director of compliance <unk> 
 i think he 's afraid that i 'll come up with something to ding them which i 'm not trying to do 
 he 's starting to make nasty comments when i ask questions 
 next i want to see their print shop 
 they run on what essentially are truck sized <unk> 
 once the statements are printed they 're put into lockable wheeled cabinets until they 're assembled and mailed 
 i reach over and touch the <unk> a nice reliable master # 4. the director of compliance snaps at me : doc : '' what do you think you could pick that '' 
 me : '' well yes 
 masters are hard to break but not too difficult to pick 
 my local <unk> group uses them to teach people to pick locks '' at this point everybody 's staring at me 
 the director of compliance is not happy 
 doc : '' so you 're saying you could <unk> in here and steal anything you wanted '' 
 me : '' well my job requires me to think like a bad guy 
 if i were so inclined i 'd make a pretty good thief '' bank compliance person : '' so do you think they 're insecure '' 
 me : '' listen listen 
 they 've got multiple controls in place 
 they 've got cameras 
 they 've got key cards 
 i 've been stopped on the way to the bathroom 
 if i were going to steal data i 'd try to get the feed into the <unk> get <unk> of thousands of records rather than a few hundred '' director of compliance : '' where did you learn to think this way '' 
 me : '' law school '' one day at my telco my boss comes to me with an unusual assignment 
 & gt boss : there 's something i 'd like you to help me with but i 'm not quite sure if it falls strictly under your job description '' 
 & gt bytewave : let 's hear it i 'll let you know '' 
 & gt boss : six months ago dropped calls to senior line quadrupled went from a little over 1 % to 4 % almost overnight 
 i asked systems three months back to explain the anomaly but they said they calls are n't being dropped for technical reasons and that nothing changed regarding the system 
 since you have access to all recordings maybe you could investigate it '' 
 so-called dropped calls are just calls that did n't actually begin at all an agent calls us and hangs up before speaking to us at all 
 the legitimate reason for it to occur other than a technical problem with the internal call system is whenever they find their answer on their own while on hold but this spike is definitely abnormal 
 & gt bytewave : yeah i have recordings of every call 
 not recordings of calls that never began at all 
 but yeah i can take this '' 
 there 's a broad line in the job description - 'all relevant operations to service the internal technical senior line - so it was my job sorta even if it <unk> with managerial work 
 first thing is to get the timestamps of dropped calls i 'm missing 
 i call switchboards who are in charge of our <unk> and internal call systems 
 & gt switchboards : wait you want logs on every call to your line for the last six months '' 
 & gt bytewave : unless you can give me specifically those who hung up before conversation started yup 
 just timestamps and employee ids will do '' 
 & gt switchboards : just got your ticket so we will get that to you within the next ten business days '' 
 & gt bytewave : ... to pull timestamps seriously 
 any <unk> or tool issues i should know about '' 
 & gt switchboards : i never said <unk> within the next 10 business days check your email '' 
 that was humor there it is with a huge csv attachment 
 & gt bytewave : i will mail you my thanks within the next 10 business days 
 have a good one '' 
 i start by looking at the shortest calls but i 'm not satisfied by the volume there 's only a few dozen that last mere seconds 
 bulk of them are obviously <unk> longer a pretty sure sign that this is n't a technical issue 
 then i get an idea i export my own recording tool 's logs to csv specifically just the timestamps by date reduce the logs i got to the same and compare the two 
 all the missing lines in <unk> are the dropped calls 
 there 's a lot and they 're all at least a few minutes long which is weird because the wait times are usually <unk> on our line 
 now the fun part tracking who is making them in such bulk 
 it takes a bit to paint a clear picture but it 's increasingly obvious 
 the crushing bulk of the dropped calls accounting for the entire increase come from a specific call center - our main subcontractor 's 
 this is n't just a few people it looks like we have dropped calls from dozens of them and upon closer inspection the calls all occur when we 're particularly busy enough to be <unk> it to call and hang up to take a short break that wo n't show up as too odd in your call statistics ... but how would they know when to hang up to avoid getting caught 
 sure there 's tickers with calls waiting but it 's pretty hard to gauge your position in the queue you 'd be bound to get caught regularly unless you came up with creative reasons to call 
 unless *something* changed over there six months ago 
 time to call their <unk> 
 & gt bytewave : bytewave from senior staff i 'd like to know about your ticker system over there specifically any changes that might have occurred around mid june earlier this year '' 
 & gt tim : hey this is tim floor manager right now 
 ticker 
 why '' 
 & gt bytewave : ... quality assurance purposes '' 
 he does n't get my life story until i get my info 
 & gt tim : uhh ... we only had one ticker it was n't really working out for a call centre this big so we put up extra displays around june yeah 
 what 's it to do with qa '' 
 & gt bytewave : lots of problematic calls from your centre ever since 
 i need more information on these new tickers are they all exactly like the one you had before '' 
 tim <unk> and puts me on hold for a minute not exactly <unk> great trust 
 once he gets back i ask again 
 & gt bytewave : actually if you could take a cellphone pic of one of the new tickers and send it to me that would be best '' 
 he seems a bit reluctant but does it still 
 & gt bytewave : that 's not a ticker tim 
 that 's a large tv connected to a computer running <unk> 's live call monitoring software 
 * '' & gt tim : yeah 
 we had the tvs on hand so it was the most cost-effective solution like you can see it has all the calls waiting in big bold at the top '' 
 & gt bytewave : that it does 
 and the live details about every queue and the the employee numbers on hold right underneath 
 anyone who can see this knows their exact position in the queue '' 
 & gt tim : ... 
 so '' 
 & gt bytewave : so we have an <unk> amount of dropped calls coming from your floor since june 
 people are looking at this and whenever we have calls waiting they 're calling us and know exactly when to hang up once they 're next in queue '' 
 & gt tim : err if that 's so we wo n't let that go <unk> that 's absolutely unacceptable '' 
 & gt bytewave : yes it is 
 the problem is that from what i 'm seeing it 's a bulk problem 
 thank you for helping me figure this out i 'll let the contractor quality director figure out the details '' 
 i swiftly hang up knowing the amount of dread that <unk> title <unk> in every subcontractor manager 's heart 
 clearly someone over there got this idea and spread it far and wide because from my logs this is happening all the time every time there 's as much as three calls waiting on our line 
 i rank my diff file by employee number and pull up anyone who shows up at least 10 times to account for legitimate hang ups 
 that 's 36 employees 
 20 times 
 30 employees 
 clearly done on purpose 
 i make a neat list of employee numbers with the diff file as evidence and off to my boss and the <unk> it goes with an explanation and the picture of the <unk> tickers 
 couple minutes later i already got an 'on it reply from the <unk> and i can hear my boss cursing 
 i give him an half smile 
 & gt boss : well excellent work ... sooo i hear you like to get subcontractors in trouble - today was a good day huh '' 
 our dropped calls were back to 1 % within a few weeks 
 * tl : dr - subcontractor put up overly detailed info on calls queues on large tvs instead of using normal tickers and their staff swiftly used this data to call us and hang up repeatedly whenever our line was busy to get <unk> little breaks 
 it took six months but it was n't so untraceable 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 i work in it for a hospital 
 i was asked to put a license for office 2010 pro on a user 's pc 
 all the paperwork was filled out so i went and installed it 
 as i was leaving one of her co-workers said hey it guy install it for me too please '' 
 i said sorry ma'am but i need the paperwork filled out and it has to be paid for 
 then i 'll come do it '' 
 she said oh ... do n't we own that company '' 
 i replied what company 
 you mean microsoft '' 
 she said yeah we do n't need to pay for it if we own the company '' 
 i just stared at her thinking that she had to be kidding 
 she just stared back waiting for an answer 
 ... no ma'am 
 i do n't think we own microsoft '' 
 i used to work for my college 's tech support team 
 i did classroom support but mainly i manned the <unk> help desk 
 like most universities we provided software to students at a discounted price through a 3rd party vendor 
 this is only available to admitted and enrolled students not a difficult concept 
 our tale of swearing law breaking and employee termination begins one lazy afternoon 
 i shall be me and <unk> pants will be known simply as angry 
 me : thank you for calling it support this is toplesspenguin how can i help you 
 angry : yes i 'm a student at university and i 'm <unk> to buy microsoft office with the student discount but it 's telling me that my student number is wrong 
 me : alright can i get your student identification number please 
 angry : it 's proceeds to give me username that has no numbers in it me : no ma'am that 's your username i need the number you put in our system to try and purchase the software 
 angry : oh we 'll why did n't you say that 
 it 's id number me : thank you 
 i proceed to look up her <unk> number and find that she was a student that has n't enrolled in classes in about 3 years ok ma'am i believe the problem is that you are not currently enrolled in any classes here 
 the discount is only available to students who are currently attending classes 
 angry : voice suddenly filled with rage and ignorance i am too a student here 
 i need office for some classes that i 'm taking over at other school not related to us at all and i <unk> the cheaper price 
 that shit is too expensive to buy regular 
 me : are you currently enrolled in classes here at university 
 angry : no but i <unk> a student 
 me : ma'am if you 're not taking classes then you 're not a student here 
 angry : i am too 
 i just had to take some time off because of illness 
 she then proceeds to tell me about her illness '' and how she still deserves her discount software and me : i 'm very sorry but unless you are taking classes you do n't qualify for the discount price 
 angry : can you just let me use your student number and order it for me 
 me : no ma'am that 's illegal 
 angry : are you new there 
 i ca n't wait till they train yo worthless ass 
 me : ma 'm insulting me will get you nowhere 
 if you 're not a student here then i can not help you 
 angry : you 're not helping me anyway 
 i ca n't believe how fucking stupid you is 
 get me my software i deserve it 
 me : no ma 'm if you 're going to yell and curse me you deserve this 
 *click* a few minutes go by and the phone rings again and on the caller id it shows her number 
 so i go and get my manager and ask if he would handle this irate woman 
 manager : thank you for calling it support this is manager how may i help you 
 angry : i just called a few minutes ago and one of your employees was rude and refused to help me 
 manager : i 'm very sorry for that i 'll have a word with toplesspenguin later 
 is there anything i can help you with 
 manager then goes through the whole process of getting her number and telling her she 's not a student and does n't get her discount 
 angry : is there anyone there with more experience who knows what they 're doing 
 manager : ma 'm i designed and created the system you 're using there is no one with more experience 
 it 's obvious you 're trying to get something you do n't qualify for 
 if you call again your number will be blacklisted and you will lose it phone support privileges 
 angry : fuck you 
 manager : in the calmest cool voice no bitch fuck you 
 *click* i have never felt more defended and cared for as an employee since that day 
 i later found out that she did call a few days later that she did call again and convinced one of the other techs to use his id for her 
 manager was listening to the call so he got fired and <unk> got blacklisted and reported to judicial affairs 
 tl dr if you give in to <unk> you get fired 
 first time lurker long poster 
 i work for a cable company as a remote tech doing virus clean ups and other garbage work 
 i get this customer about 5 time a day 
 very simple stuff but enough to drive me insane 
 me : you already know cc : clueless customer 
 at some point during any call you are going to need to restart the computer all tech support knows this 
 & gt me : thank for calling insert name here my name is <unk> how can i help you 
 & gt cc : my computer wo n't connect to the <unk> a <unk> being mean to me 
 fix it 
 & gt me : okay could you please restart your computer for me really quickly 
 sometimes that helps 
 & gt cc : you want me to shut it down an turn it back on 
 & gt me : yes please 
 & gt cc : all the way off 
 & gt me : yes please 
 & gt cc : how should i do that 
 & gt me : click start and click restart 
 & gt cc : where 's start 
 by this point i am ready to throw my headset out the window 
 thank you all for letting me vent 
 i 'm sure i will have more humorous stories <unk> were standing outside mexican <unk> style 
 i could finally see how these <unk> always ended up with someone dead 
 if i had a <unk> 
 & gt vp : and you 
 how could you 
 i thought we had an understanding 
 the vp was looking directly at screechy he looked disappointed 
 screechy finally decided to defend herself 
 she certainly didn’t seem in a hurry to do so 
 & gt screechy : listen vp it wasn’t us 
 we were together all morning 
 we should call the police and airz should probably get back to it and start getting services back online 
 i took another sip of my coffee 
 tasted surprisingly sensible 
 i liked this coffee 
 & gt vp : oh no give you two a chance to break more things 
 no no no you both can wait in hr till the police confirm things 
 & gt me : sorry 
 listen services need to come <unk> & gt vp : you think i give a darn about services 
 get it into your head ive caught you 
 the vp was practically in a rage i thought about arguing further but a coffee in hr did sound quite nice <unk> my cup was almost empty 
 whilst walking to hr i wondered who exactly <unk> the <unk> conditioner 
 the vp did seem genuinely mad about it… 
 upon arrival at hr screechy and i were sat down in an abandoned office 
 & gt screechy : <unk> this is nice 
 i took a sip of my nearly empty coffee 
 the small talk was nice 
 & gt me : yep 
 perfect start to an audit 
 & gt screechy : you didn’t er… do it did you 
 i took another sip of coffee 
 small talk was over 
 the coffee cup was empty 
 it sure goes fast 
 next older one quiet evening at home taking senior line calls as usual for telco.ca 
 <unk> that week as i preferred not to share the <unk> i had with the rest of the office 
 & gt bytewave : senior line bytewave you may send me your ticket 
 & gt gary : hi bytewave this is gary at the <unk> offices 
 my customer has problems with his tv remote every night it 's just not working right now but we already changed the batteries and the remote ... 
 twice '' 
 i look at his file check who had the bright idea of sending a second remote for fun 
 subcontractor logic of course : if a solution fails to fix a problem apply more of the same and pray ... & gt bytewave : i see you said right now that the remote works at times and at others it does n't 
 is the customer always setting in the same spot and pointing at the set top box '' 
 & gt gary : yeah i checked the basics 
 nothing unusual in regards to the box either but it 's just not working '' 
 & gt bytewave : tell the customer the location of the ir receiver on the <unk> have him walk up to it put the remote directly in front of it about a <unk> away and try changing the channel '' 
 & gt gary : be right back '' 
 basic interference test 
 coffee refill while i hold 
 idly browse customer 's history i notice all the calls this customer gave us - quite a few - have evening timestamps 
 & gt gary : yeah that worked somehow 
 i do n't understand though its a brand new remote and new batteries 
 our tech tested it earlier at normal range '' 
 & gt bytewave : yeah we have interference 
 you said this happened in the evenings right 
 i want to know exactly how that room is lit 
 every source of light in range lamps <unk> <unk> lights types of lights positions versus the <unk> and the couch '' 
 more holding 
 holding for tests is half what i clock on the job when taking calls no matter how basic the instructions it always take longer than it should to perform 
 & gt gary : yeah there 's four lamps in the living room two on the wall with the tv and the home theater system two on the on the opposite walls 
 three are lit right now the customer is n't able to identify which kinds of lights they have though '' 
 & gt bytewave : okay then have him turn off all three lamps sit on his couch and try again '' 
 & gt gary : but what do the lamps have to do with ... '' & gt bytewave : i 'm willing to bet one or more of these is fluorescent and the source of the problem 
 why do you think he always calls us in the evenings about this problem '' 
 & gt gary : but why would ... '' & gt bytewave : i 'll explain when we do n't have a customer on hold 
 just tell him to turn off his lamps '' 
 he proceeds to do so and miraculously no more problems 
 & gt gary : alright the customer tried switching them off one by one and found the one causing the problem 
 he 'll be swapping it with another lamp 
 this is the first time i heard of this is this a new bug with our cable boxes '' 
 & gt bytewave : <unk> 
 google something like <unk> lamp interference remote and you 'll find articles dating back from the 90s on resolving issues related to high-frequency fluorescent lighting systems interfering with <unk> tv <unk> 
 it just does n't come up often enough as a real world issue so everyone forgot or never learned about it '' 
 & gt gary : ... huh 
 thanks '' & gt bytewave : thank you for choosing senior line and have a good evening '' 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 ... nobody can administer it 
 too short 
 't is a quick one so i 'll elaborate 
 local <unk> sys admin here 
 trying to go about my day creating / deleting accounts when i have one of the rare bits of work to do in our <unk> compliant secure email system for which the yearly demands to make it more secure continue to get more and more ridiculous 
 & gt tao : unable to connect to server 
 <unk> yo boss can you get in 
 & gt boss : nope 
 you using the elevated network access vpn 
 & gt tao : nope never needed to before for this 
 & gt boss : i 'll check with adguru 
 & gt adguru : using the elevated access here 
 no luck either 
 <unk> **to the project <unk> * insert <unk> noise here * <unk> 
 ** & gt tao : yo <unk> any recent work on the <unk> servers 
 & gt <unk> : why yes want the change details 
 & gt tao : yes please : <unk> <unk> <unk> rdp <unk> * was previously deny <unk> connection but <unk> reminded me how much the double <unk> bugs me too * ** ... .** & gt tao : well if they do n't want anyone new to use the system then that 's one way to make it secure 
 clearly the best type of security is the inability to access <unk> definitely compliant 
 the moral of story project managers do n't check with administrators whether the requested server changes will have any impact of day-to-day access 
 post edit : thanks on all the upvotes was n't expecting this for an off the cuff post from an amusing start to my <unk> a <unk> it engineer with a health service i occasionally had to take a trainee minion with me so they could experience real it work 
 my work was varied from installation of hardware cabling software install to the turn it off / turn it on '' fixes 
 as a result i carried a lot of spare kit with me and every tool imaginable 
 i had arrived at a remote site in a small <unk> town ad was scheduled for the entire day to <unk> and fix the simple issues that they were getting 
 we brought my kit in from the car and settled down with a coffee 
 & gt minion : i 'm curious about three things in your toolbox 
 & gt me : go on 
 & gt minion : nail polish remover nail file and clear sticky tape - the cheap stuff 
 why do you need them 
 as if on queue we are asked to fix a printer 
 the laserjet in one of the offices was jamming paper 
 i used the air can in my kit to clean out dust and then check the roller 
 it 's smooth 
 & gt pass me the nail polish remover please and grab me a couple of paper towels from the <unk> 
 minion returns to see me soak a paper towel with the remover then wipe it over the roller 
 after a few seconds i dry off the roller and <unk> it allowing a test print 
 no more <unk> 
 & gt me : the <unk> in the nail polish remover eats at the roller and <unk> it up a little 
 it buys us time to order a new set and have them delivered 
 i make a note of the asset number of the printer and the model 
 & gt minion : what about the tape 
 & gt me : these pcs have a design fault 
 the power switch is a <unk> that 's held in place by two flimsy plastic clips 
 any decent force pushes the mechanism into the case and you ca n't turn it off or on 
 if one breaks i just wrap a layer of this tape around the switch and <unk> it 
 it <unk> the switch in place and again provides a temporary solution until we can replace it 
 i see he 's making notes 
 & gt me : first rule of customer service 
 make sure that the customer is working even if you have to stick things together with tape and glue 
 they 're not fixes but they are temporary solutions that means the customers are not sat <unk> their thumbs 
 that trainee now services our printers and still carries tape a nail file and polish remover in his <unk> 've been <unk> busy and have n't had time to write about this one 
 i 'm doing third party security audits for a bank 
 these are fairly <unk> send a questionnaire show up ask the it compliance and hr people a bunch of questions write a report go home 
 sometimes they 're fun sometimes not this particular vendor has a substantial server <unk> 
 they 're responsible for the client 's online banking credit cards and mortgage products 
 they seem fairly <unk> with a fair amount of internal software development and separate information security and technology groups 
 i also am traveling with the bank 's compliance lawyer 
 she 's happy to see me 
 she finds me at least partially amusing as opposed to the other techies doing these reviews 
 she 's looking through various policies while i hang out with the vendor 's techies 
 i 'm dealing with a <unk> of the vendor 's it and is staff : bearded unix guy bug a <unk> unix veteran 
 he 's a senior member of the unix sysadmin team 
 <unk> windows admin <unk> swag bug 's equivalent on the windows side 
 she 's wearing black clothing serious boots and lots of silver <unk> 
 <unk> security guy tsg a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 he 's responsible for securing stuff 
 he 's not happy i 'm here 
 compliance <unk> <unk> ccc a <unk> dressed but none too bright young man 
 he 's cheerful but guarded around me 
 i get to asking questions and taking notes 
 tsg is trying to sell me on how locked down everything is 
 i get a sense bug & amp swag do n't like him since they roll their eyes every so often when he speaks 
 i ask about what $ vendor does about internal controls 
 tsg is very proud of what he 's done to protect the important servers from the rest of the network : tsg : '' we channel all server access to five pivot servers 
 these pivot servers have two ethernet connections and bridge the server network to the rest of the network 
 you have to <unk> with the pivot server before <unk> with the server you want '' me : '' ok. interesting 
 what kind of intrusion detection or prevention do you use '' 
 tsg : '' do n't need it 
 we log all traffic coming through the pivot box '' me : '' and all other connections are <unk> off '' 
 i notice swag smile ever so slightly 
 tsg : '' all traffic has to go through the pivot '' me : '' ok. how do you ensure that '' 
 tsg exasperated : '' all traffic has to go through the pivot '' me : '' so there 's a firewall between the workstation network and the server network '' 
 tsg : '' i do n't think you understand 
 all traffic has to go through the pivot '' i turn to swag and bug 
 me : '' can i ping your servers from here '' 
 bug : '' yes you can '' me : '' can i login to the servers from here '' 
 tsg : '' you have to go through the pivot '' me : '' so the firewall blocks ssh and rdp traffic '' 
 i notice that both swag and bug are nodding 'no 
 me : '' is there a firewall between the workstation and server network '' 
 bug : '' no '' me : '' what actually makes traffic go through the pivot '' 
 tsg : '' security policy requires it '' me : '' ok. so if i 'm an employee i 'm supposed to do it or i get in trouble '' tsg : '' exactly '' me : '' have you stopped to consider that an attacker or malicious <unk> may not consider this a significant threat '' 
 ccc : '' all employees sign a document agreeing to follow policy '' me : '' let me explain 
 you have a control that is trivial to avoid 
 you 've got a toll booth in the middle of a field 
 only honest people will pay the toll '' tsg : '' but we have policy in place '' me : '' <unk> may not actually follow policy '' i realize that it 's not up to me to explain my findings to this guy so i proceed to other controls that are easier like hard drive destruction 
 during a break ccc and tsg leave 
 i notice that bug and swag seem to be smiling at me 
 i try to talk about non technology stuff- hobbies travel family 
 i inadvertently mention that i went to law school 
 bug turns to me with a big smile 
 bug : '' do you post stories on reddit '' 
 me : '' uhh what '' 
 bug : '' i 've read your stories '' 
 bug pointing to swag : '' this is the guy who wrote those stories about doing tech support '' me : '' i admit nothing 
 but if i do write anything i wo n't mention the pizza stain on your shirt '' so my co-worker is being twisted into <unk> today 
 he deals with any compromised account issues and works with other teams to block websites that have a high number of malicious pages on them like <unk> or offer free <unk> 
 today he 's pissed because a lady clicked on an email link that told her to enter in her corporate credentials 
 however she received the message that the page was blocked due to phishing attempts 
 so she goes on her phone and enters in her account information 
 then she gets all pissy when m $ realizes her account is sending out tons of spam and they <unk> it and takes it out on my co-worker

 frontline library computer tech here 
 about a month ago a woman in her mid 40s came into my computer lab 
 <unk> <unk> simple enough 
 & gt me : hello do you need any help 
 & gt lady : yes i need to make a new website 
 me knowing almost nothing about making a website 
 & gt me : alright do you know how you made your previous one 
 maybe i can <unk> out how she made her old website and direct her to the appropriate resources & gt lady : no 
 damn & gt me : ok do you know what language you used 
 & gt lady : i think it was yahoo 
 well now we 're getting somewhere & gt me : so you 're looking to make a new email address then 
 & gt lady : yeah i forgot the password to my old one last year 
 & gt me : maybe we can recover the password 
 do you remember the address 
 & gt lady : i do n't think so oh wait ... it might be $ <unk> & gt me : do you remember the password 
 & gt lady : no ... but it could be $ password 
 both worked on the first try & gt me : enjoy your old email and write down the address and and password so you do n't forget and that 's the story of how if helped a woman make a new website by recovering her old email 
 my mum who manages a client management system was once having a problem with her laptop which did n't want to log on to the domain 
 even though she 's not *too* tech savvy she had the <unk> to take it to their in-office tech support guys to diagnose the problem 
 part of fixing this problem involved disconnecting the laptop from the network 
 so instead of hitting the physical wifi switch on the side of the machine the tech guy <unk> the laptop outside of the office and down the road until it lost wifi reception 
 * <unk> carried the laptop outside of the office and down the road until it lost wifi reception 
 *** '' the ghosts of print jobs past <unk> the color printer in sales and marketing 
 i <unk> request that you arrive at your earliest convenience to perform an exorcism on the mysterious <unk> of that printer to <unk> the <unk> demons 
 in case you need to diagnose the problem by personally <unk> an <unk> i have left a sample of their <unk> attached to the wall near the printer

 the intern is still here this week so they can fetch chicken feet eye of <unk> or any other <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> you require to ensure success 
 i could just say that the color printer in sales & amp marketing needs routine cleaning and maintenance but where 's the fun in that 
 '' get an email from one of the scientist in the lab i support 
 he needed a cable to connect to a projector 
 i asked him which cable he needed 
 in reply i got : i believe it is a serial connection with the plug being fairly large <unk> and with six pins in each of the three <unk> with the middle row <unk> from the other two '' 
 after i laughed for a minute i pointed him directly to a vga <unk> and i stood outside starring at the <unk> air-conditioner 
 you would have to be <unk> to destroy something so exposed a building was directly facing the wall the air conditioner was placed on 
 it was a wall of windows 
 the vp arrived to access the damage 
 i expected he’d want to control the situation which was fine with me 
 hell if i would volunteer my time to fill out police reports 
 & gt vp : airz 
 & gt me : oh vp yes its pretty bad 
 the server room is cooked 
 & gt vp : why would you do this 
 & gt me : sorry 
 & gt vp : and you miss screechy 
 why’d you help destroy a server room 
 & gt me : it wasn’t <unk> & gt vp : like hell it wasn’t 
 i get a call about the server room going down run to the server room realize the air conditioner is <unk> 
 when i arrive outside i find you two still admiring your handiwork 
 & gt me : er… 
 no 
 miss screechy and i worked out the same thing as you came outside and found this sabotage 
 i point over to the air-conditioner with the pipe sticking through it 
 i realize i’m still carrying coffee 
 i take a sip 
 tastes a little bit like a framing 
 & gt vp : see 
 you’re carrying coffee 
 if it was such an emergency you’d have dropped it 
 i looked down at my coffee… 
 coffee was getting me in trouble 
 coffee was framing me 
 next older so i got asked about my flair yesterday so i thought i 'd share the tale ... that 's very likely <unk> ... and i 've probably filled in some points incorrectly ... it 's also only tangentially related to it ... and it 's also <unk> 
 there 's a demolition site near where i work and the <unk> often frequent the sandwich shop i go to for lunch 
 one of them is complaining about how the mandatory site safety training they were doing this morning felt like being taught to suck eggs 
 so the other guy explained they were forcing it on everyone because of what happened at their last site : & gt ~ ~ wibbly wobbly wibbly wobbly flashback ~ ~ they 'd hired $ newguy who instead of doing the job he 'd been hired to do acted as a gopher for $ sitemanager 
 so he was well known by everyone on site as 'the guy who gets stuff for the boss the morning of their last demolition the $ sitemanager was having trouble connecting his laptop to their wireless hub even standing right next to it 
 he phoned up their it for help <unk> : it & lt it does belong here and he was told to get a cord and just plug it into the back for now 
 note the specific use of the word <unk> $ newguy gets sent off to get him a cord 
 he comes back twenty minutes later with a large length of detcord 
 turns out $ newguy had worked in construction but not in <unk> 
 and it turns out he did n't know where he could get network cable on site so he started asking the other guys around where the cords were kept 
 $ <unk> when hearing the site manager needed it said yeah sure '' went off and got him the detcord 
 $ newguy having never seen detcord or probably cat5 for that matter thought nothing of it and sauntered back to $ sitemanager 
 $ sitemanager 's boss - who was naturally on site for the big day - clearly was n't pleased 
 now if you do n't know what detcord is it 's basically a fuse 
 that explodes 
 at 4 miles per second 
 it 's used to trigger multiple higher explosives simultaneously and it 's what they use to make sure all the charges go off at the same time 
 you probably do n't want to stick it in your laptop 
 hell you probably could n't <unk> the ends of it without losing a limb 
 anyway the higher ups got shit scared that a new hire could so easily get a hold of explosives you know cause <unk> 
 needless to say there was a major security audit resulting in everyone getting extra site safety training and $ sitemanager being told not to use the same guy regularly as a gopher - whether it was $ newguy or not 
 & gt ~ ~ wibbly wobbly wibbly wobbly flashback ends ~ ~ i never asked if he found any <unk> though 
 but if the last site was the building they blew up last year there 's a lot of old <unk> 's <unk> <unk> around here then it 's surrounded by about 6 computer parts shops not counting a pc world and an <unk> within spitting distance so i 'm sure he got some 
 **tl dr company worry intensely about <unk> stealing their explosives 
 **at the shop 
 it was <unk> and i was hungry for mcdonalds mmm big mac and sleep 
 i got a text from the boss 
 close up mate 
 - boss '' so i do the usual routine 
 lock the door turn off the light when ... a knock 
 a loud knock 
 i turn around expecting the police to be there 
 instead a man looking in his fifties was waving at me 
 i open the door 
 & gt sir we are closed 
 please come back tomorrow '' & gt i err.. need something now '' 
 & gt sir this is closed now

 turn off the lights head toward the employee room 
 the phone rings 
 & gt this is an automated recording to announce a change in your clock system '' 
 i hang up 
 i know that the server provider is doing this i know about the change <unk> 
 walking out the door and locking it i find the man staring at me muttering <unk> '' to himself over and over 
 <unk> 'm new to this sub so i 'm sure there are <unk> customers than this but so far i have n't heard anyone worse 
 this happened a long time ago so hopefully i can recreate the conversation appropriately 
 & gt **customer : ** my tv signal is n't working it just went out 
 & gt **me : ** oh i 'm sorry to hear that sir 
 i 'll get that working for you as soon as possible 
 so you said you were watching tv and it just stopped working 
 & gt **customer : ** well it was working earlier 
 i just turned on the tv right now and there 's no picture 
 no sound either 
 & gt **me : ** okay 
 so on the screen are you getting any message like no input '' or source not found '' 
 & gt **customer : ** nope 
 i still see the channel numbers and guide but every channel is blank 
 & gt **me : ** hmm okay 
 i 'm looking through your account right now and i see you had an installation scheduled for today 
 did you make sure the tv and everything were working before the installer left 
 & gt **customer : ** oh the guy 's still here 
 he 's out back installing my service 
 & gt **me : ** very very very very long pause the installer is still outside 
 so he has n't hooked up anything inside your home yet 
 & gt **customer : ** nah he 's trying to run a line right now 
 & gt **me : ** another long pause so you had a different cable service already and we 're installing a different one 
 & gt **customer : ** that 's right 
 & gt **me : ** sigh on mute of course i apologize for the confusion and inconvenience sir but your other cable service will be down until we finish then installation 
 i assure you you 're tv service will be working when we 're finished installing it 
 exact <unk> & gt **customer : ** oh okay 
 sounds good 
 thanks for your <unk> years ago i started working in my current post as an it manager 
 my predecessor had decided to turn our old <unk> into a printer room and thrust a large <unk> printer in there that does our critical print jobs 
 a year after i started the <unk> froze cracked and when the weather picked up around fifty gallons of water <unk> through the printer 
 i was tasked with securing a replacement and this is the conversation i had with the accountant acc & gt acc : i do n't see why we need all these features on the printer 
 & gt me : we print <unk> pages in a single run so this will cope without having to <unk> the printer with paper 
 of that run 1000 pages are colour <unk> and another 1000 are <unk> 
 trust me this is the minimum spec for a printer 
 & gt acc : but 5 grand is a lot for a printer 
 my inkjet cost fifty <unk> 
 & gt me : your inkjet does n't print at fifty pages a minute and hold five thousand pages 
 it also would have to replace the cartridges <unk> through the print run 
 & gt acc : what about if we go for a second hand printer 
 & gt me : i ca n't get a full warranty out of a refurbished one and you never know how badly its been used previously 
 if it fails we wo n't be covered 
 & gt acc : surely we have a backup solution 
 & gt me : sure - a printer that runs at fifteen pages a minute 
 it will take us all day to do a print run on that so we will only use it for dire emergencies not as a fix 
 & gt acc : that 's fine then 
 we 'll get the second hand one and use the backup as an interim fix if it breaks 
 & gt me : i 'd rather have the agreement that if the new printer breaks then we replace it within 2 weeks 
 i do n't want to be <unk> an older and slower printer with the main print run for too long 
 & gt acc : we 'll cross that bridge when we come to it 
 i can always swing it by the board 
 we bought the 3 year old printer and last week it died 
 one thousand pounds worth of component costs alone three days labour 
 the device came with a 1 year <unk> warranty and the second year was a simple fix '' warranty - labour and small ie cheap parts 
 now the accountant is wondering why it 's not being fixed and a new printer has not been <unk> for 
 we can get a new one for 7 grand or a <unk> for five 
 this time i 'm not settling for the <unk> 
 edit : disclaimer - our company owners never lease anything 
 all managed print solutions are purchased <unk> days 
 email from a user : the copier in room is n't working 
 there 's an error light on it '' 
 well heck that 's on the way to the coffee pot might as well check it out 
 walk to the printer 
 there 's an error message on the screen : process failed please press button for restart 
 the error message is next to a big red button 
 i pressed the button 
 the copier restarted 
 the waiting crowd was astounded 
 **tl dr : only <unk> hours until i can drink 
 ** edit : i <unk> <unk> 
 so we recently made some changes to our wifi infrastructure here and predictably it 's caused a great deal of <unk> from the users 
 that this was going to be done was announced a month ago and a web page put up explaining what you 'd have to do 
 it was announced again last week as is our way and again last night before the change actually occurred 
 there 's been a lot of why is the internet down '' 
 and my username 's broken '' 
 and a whole bunch of why does n't it just work 
 why do i have to do anything 
 it worked yesterday 
 this is too hard '' 
 coming from people who did n't read the email announcements or the status '' or news '' <unk> on the intranet site or even the notice that we stuck up outside the department hoping that people might read it before coming in here ... which is causing a certain degree of <unk> feeling among the support team but this one this one user ... from : idiot @ company to : help @ company support @ company linemanager @ company local-office-drone @ company it-team-member-1 @ company it-team-member-2 @ company it-team-member-3 @ company ... it went on like that 
 as far as i can see she just emailed every address she 's ever <unk> with 
 subject : wireless down & gt '' the wireless is down '' 
 then a whole bunch of reply to all '' happened with the various <unk> people <unk> emailing help and occasionally even each other and it took a couple of hours to <unk> everyone who had nothing to do with this out of the conversation 
 once the shouting had shut up we managed to get a reply back explaining that the wifi was not down and that she needed to log in using her <unk> and password now along with detailed instructions as to how 
 also a fairly stern warning about sending out bulk mail and why it was causing everyone such a pain in the ass 
 what did we get back 
 from : idiot @ company to : help @ company support @ company linemanager @ company local-office-drone @ company it-team-member-1 @ company it-team-member-2 @ company it-team-member-3 @ company ... etc subject : ok. & gt '' the wireless is still down '' 
 <unk> the reply to all happened again 
 whilst we were trying to <unk> everyone down we got another again cc 'd to basically everyone she 'd ever met 
 & gt '' i tried the password '' 
 then another ... & gt '' it did n't work '' 
 then another ... & gt '' i tried my username too 
 is that the password '' 
 and another ... & gt '' what 's the password '' 
 each time cc 'd to what appears to be her entire address book each time just one line with no context 
 each one a new ticket that we have to <unk> with the old tickets to try and track this growing <unk> 
 to try and stem the <unk> we sent one of the helldesk to her office to talk to her in person ... she was n't there 
 whilst hunting for her more emails kept coming in 
 & gt '' i thought my password might be wrong '' 
 & gt '' my password is password ... is that right '' 
 **headdesk** & gt '' i tried <unk> which is for my pc ... is it that one '' 
 <unk> <unk> & gt '' i changed my password to <unk> 
 that does n't work either '' 
 i had this image of someone sitting there just typing whatever came into their head into their email client and hitting send to all '' once every few seconds never reading the replies that came back 
 then something occurred to me ... if she 's not sat in front of the computer in her office and she 's not able to use the wifi then where the hell is she sending these emails from 
 i was composing a message to that effect when i got this final one : & gt '' by the way i 'm at home '' 
 tl dr : user ca n't get their home wifi to work 
 spam everyone they 've ever met with their stream of <unk> whilst trying to fix it.i have a really nice speaking voice for the phone and it works to my advantage 
 but at times it can form an unrealistic expectation of my looks to men i talk to on the phone 
 i talk to a lot of guys who work in the field and they are less like the corporate guys who apologize for swearing and more like boys playing around 
 they really have no filter 
 they usually try to <unk> flirt with me 
 i do n't care so much about that it 's the time it takes for them to stop and tell me their problem that drives me insane 
 i have never <unk> patience as a virtue 
 one guy in particular was especially <unk> and obviously decided that he had game '' and would try and woo me even though we were over 2000 miles a part 
 after our first conversation i called him the <unk> your voice is <unk> '' guy 
 dyvis for short 
 also one note before i start the story this guy had a pending request on my facebook that i had neither accepted or ignored 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- there i am minding my own business when i get a phonecall 
 i rattle off my usual spiel 
 dyvis : hey baby nice to hear your lovely voice 
 me : oh hello what 's going on 
 nervously laugh dyvis : why have n't you accepted my fb request 
 me : oh i really only have people i know in person and really well on there 
 dyvis : ah <unk> i 'm not a creep 
 me : what problem are you having 
 i try to <unk> from the uncomfortable conversation 
 dyvis : oh i see how it is 
 he <unk> my aircard is n't working 
 after some troubleshooting and remoting into his pc i am checking the drivers and need him to take out the aircard and put it back in 
 me : can you take it out and put it back in 
 dyvis : woah <unk> it 's a little early for us to be doing that 
 laughs <unk> shredding every last <unk> of patience i had ever <unk> to <unk> 
 finally fed up my voice entered a flat tone and i said : no i am not talking about your <unk> i am talking about your aircard 
 he <unk> the line goes silently awkward 
 my coworker practically broke his neck as he swung it around looking at me with surprise 
 the guy finally does as i ask and he stays blissfully silent the whole time 
 i 'm sure he thought i was going to report him but i just wanted him to <unk> 
 greetings fellow support experts 
 i 've come to <unk> you with a tale of great justice 
 this is a follow on to an earlier tale about a ridiculously stupid <unk> that just does n't have a clue what she 's doing which you can read at : after <unk> quite a great deal of hassle and headache associated with their migration to quickbooks <unk> the owners of senior <unk> finally came to the realization that they were ridiculously <unk> and <unk> plus lacked real quickbooks experience to deal with their <unk> contractors 
 so they decided to add a few heads to the operation 
 at the time they had 4 employees / 4 workstations including owner p 's server '' machine 
 they wanted to add 3 more stations and <unk> support advised that they would need a <unk> server for their quickbooks data - something i had been suggesting for the better part of a year now yes i could <unk> have up to 10 stations with 7 pro but a server is clearly the way to go here 
 since owner p never listens to the it guy but listens to <unk> support she now was onboard with me and owner m that they needed to go with a dedicated <unk> 
 so i spec out an <unk> lenovo server box with <unk> of raid storage and server <unk> with 10 <unk> 
 plus 3 additional workstations identical to what they purchased earlier 
 they have no issues they order the stuff stuff delivers 
 all is well 
 over a weekend i get the server in and set up move the data <unk> no problems at all backups are running and the only machine with any shares at all is the <unk> box 
 sweet 
 owner p also requested a second monitor since user l has two hooked up her old <unk> monitor to the vga port 
 so there was an extra monitor in there for owner p since she needs to feel special p has her new <unk> monitor set to 1024x768 resolution btw 
 monday evening owner p starts texting me like crazy while i 'm at the gym : & gt <unk> 'd the quickbooks data go 
 & gt <unk> come the quickbooks isnt in my documents & gt 'i moved the quickbooks from the p drive to my documents & gt 'i ca n't log in to quickbooks it says it cant find the file & gt <unk> screwed everything up with this server i want it back the way it was & gt 'i ca n't see my quick books screen through go to my pc at the same time user l emails me : & gt 'p f -- -- d up the quickbooks somehow 
 can you un-f -- k it when you get a minute 
 also the vendor excel sheet is gone i think she f -- -- d that up too 
 i come home and prepare to vnc in to un-f -- k the f -- k up before dinner 
 turns out that owner p did in fact move the <unk> data file and vendor excel file to her my documents and her <unk> times 
 i proceeded to undo the mess and put the files in the right place so user l and everyone else is working just fine 
 as i 'm wrapping up owner p apparently gotomypc 's into her machine and sees i 've done work 
 she proceeds to call my phone and that 's when the sparks flew : & gt p : oh thank god you 've answered 
 things are really screwed up 
 & gt me : well yes they would be since you moved the data file off the server where it belongs 
 you ca n't go moving the data file 
 & gt p : but it needs to be on my pc 
 i 'm in charge so it should be on my pc 
 & gt me : that 's not how it works anymore 
 we have gone to a dedicated server <unk> and all shared data needs to be on the server 
 & gt p : that 's not how i want it 
 & gt me : well that 's how it is now 
 your pc does n't have any shared folders as it should so nobody else in the office can see the data on your computer 
 anything that needs to be shared must be on the p drive anything you do n't want shared should go in your documents folder 
 & gt p : that 's so stupid 
 i should be the master computer 
 my computer should share everything 
 & gt me no 
 you just spent x dollars on a server which does all that now for you just like quickbooks and i recommended 
 you ca n't share with all the office pc 's using just your computer remember 
 & gt p : that 's <unk> -- t 
 but fine 
 i give up 
 did you fix the thing 
 and why ca n't i see my quickbooks on go to my pc 
 & gt me : well it 's unfortunate you do n't like it this way but it 's the way it has to be 
 as far as your gotomypc access it would appear that you have quickbooks running on your second monitor 
 did you switch monitors in gotomypc 
 & gt p : switch monitors 
 what the hell is that 
 & gt me : you should be able to control what monitor you 're looking at when using gotomypc 
 i 'm not sure what the control would look like i do n't use gotomypc 
 & gt p : fine 
 so how did you fix the mess 
 & gt me : i put the quickbooks file and vendor excel file back in the appropriate locations on the p drive 
 now everyone can access them and user l is already in the system remotely from home without any issues 
 & gt p : how come i always have so many problems with quickbooks 
 & gt me : well once everything is set up properly and the files are in the right place you 're the only one that has problems p. l m and s never have <unk> every time you report a problem it 's due to you not opening the right file or something else that is only on your end 
 & gt p : are you saying i do n't know what i 'm doing 
 & gt me : no i 'm merely stating my <unk> from current and prior experiences 
 i believe you guys are hiring a new person that 's a quickbooks expert correct 
 & gt p : yes but i 'm very computer savvy i 'm a quickbooks expert 
 you do n't know what you 're talking about you 're the idiot that screws everything up 
 & gt & lt & lt and here is where i lost it and rage mode ensued 
 i could have cared less about the job at this point 
 i just <unk> full <unk> treatment style here 
 & gt & gt & gt me : p how old are you 
 & gt p : i 'm <unk> 
 & gt me : okay p. i 'm going to be direct here so just shut up and listen 
 what you just said is not the case at all 
 you are the one that does n't know what you 're talking about 
 you are the one that screws everything up 
 you claim to be a computer savvy individual that knows quickbooks yet you 've managed to create the largest quickbooks <unk> -- k that one of their senior engineers has ever seen 
 you do n't understand how a network works you do n't understand how data is supposed to be shared in an organization and most of <unk> do n't have a clue how accounting works 
 you are the cause of all the problems in your business because you sabotage the employees there that do know what they 're doing 
 how dare you call me an idiot when i am the one that is constantly fixing your screw ups 
 & gt p : & lt stammering & gt <unk> & gt me : quite frankly p you are without a doubt the most incompetent ignorant user i 've dealt with in the last ten years 
 you have no business being in a quickbooks file and really you have no business being on a computer to begin with 
 you just told me you give up '' <unk> that 's what you need to do 
 give <unk> enjoy your life and your <unk> and whatever else makes you happy 
 just for f -- <unk> sake stay away from a computer and let your people do the work for you 
 & gt p : & lt sobbing & gt <unk> & gt me : now have yourself a lovely evening 
 i 'm going to go eat now 
 & gt p : bye 
 at this point i figured i was done with the company 
 she 'd fly into a rage at owner m and demand they bring someone else in 
 i could have cared less 
 however ten minutes later owner m calls me… & gt m : what did you say to p 
 & gt me : she said i was an idiot and did n't know what i was doing so i laid down the ugly truth to her 
 & gt m : whatever it was you rocked her world 
 she told me she was n't going to be in the rest of the week and was crying up a storm 
 & gt me : good 
 & gt m : indeed 
 thank you for everything 
 owner m told me that a couple days later owner p let her know she was throwing in the towel and finally retiring <unk> spend more time with family 
 she came in and cleaned out her office that friday 
 owner m is beyond grateful to me as she had been trying to get p to retire for over a year and p would n't budge 
 tl dr - idiot owner screws things up again claims to be a genius and calls it guy an idiot 
 it guy verbally <unk> owner into submission and <unk> read this other story and it reminded me of something a coworker shared with me from back in his day 
 a story where <unk> of management and tech support <unk> 
 let 's call this coworker tim '' 
 many years ago at a company far far away ... tim was working for a u.s. defense firm 
 as you may expect defense companies use computers and other stuff to test military hardware 
 one day during a particular test cycle the test fails and fails hard 
 in the beginning it 's not even clear if it 's an issue with the computerized test <unk> or the unit under test uut '' 
 god help you if your test equipment fried a perfectly good uut -- the <unk> will refer you to <unk> <unk> before running like hell 
 so there 's a tight schedule and all testing is <unk> because of this failure 
 managers are sweating 
 senior managers are sweating 
 directors and vps are sweating 
 the customer pays a call to say 'hello in person 
 for defense firms the customer '' is a polite term for <unk> members of the armed forces '' 
 it falls to tim to be the man on the spot 
 hey tim fix this up double quick '' 
 he gets to it 
 after some troubleshooting it turns out the test equipment is buggered but the uut is fine 
 the fix will take roughly 20-40 minutes 
 ... except that all these managers senior managers big wigs galore and the customer are <unk> together 30 feet way to <unk> '' 
 we know how some managers are when it comes to <unk> via being physically present in the room 
 every few minutes one of these folks would break away from the group <unk> over to tim and ask some version of so how 's it going '' 
 or what 's your status '' 
 or how close are you to being finished 
 every ... few ... minutes 
 a 20-40 minute job quickly starts to extend into forever 
 tim 's direct manager walks in 
 i mean what 's taking tim so damn long 
 let 's call tim 's direct manager bob '' 
 bob takes one look at the group of big wigs and then one look at tim then back to the big wigs 
 bob walks over to tim 
 bob : tim how are you doing '' 
 tim : well bob i 'm trying to do this <unk> work so we can get back to test 
 i know what needs to be done i should be done by now to tell you the truth but they keep coming over one by one and interrupting me '' 
 bob spins on the balls of his feet and jabs his finger up in the air 
 everybody out '' 
 after a few minutes of <unk> and political <unk> the room is <unk> except for tim and bob 
 tim continues his work and bob actually helps out by passing tools around 
 job is done steps and fixes are logged the word <unk> faster than bad news and testing can resume 
 forever after tim knew he liked working for bob 
 edit : front page wow 
 thank you everybody 
 edit # 2 : holy man i never expected such a turn out when i wrote this 
 personal records <unk> 
 thank you all 
 i hope to share more stories as they come and we know they will 
 <unk> hands and <unk> thank you 
 edit # 3 : made it on to best of <unk> <unk> '' 
 many thanks ffs 
 people are complete idiots 
 as a web designer this is what i get 80 % of the time - so you can do this for $ 100 right 
 anyways today i had a potential call me and ask about web job he had and this is how it went 
 client : i am looking to build a website for my small company i already have the logo and content i just need the website done 
 & lt ... here i gather the details ... & gt after gathering details me : this sounds like a plan so as far as budget <unk> client : yes so we were thinking $ 250 would be good 
 me : so you want me to spend about two weeks on a project and get paid $ 250 
 client : well it is easy right so what is the problem 
 me : the problem is you are paying me $ <unk> for estimated time 
 client : but web design is easy 
 me : then do it yourself 
 *click* ffs 
 tl dr - web design is easy therefore you should be paid $ <unk> 
 **edit : ** after this i have reformatted my website to include in the contact form <unk> <unk> 
 before this i never did as to let them send details and negotiate 
 from now on though i will see how this works out ... of course the field is not a required field but lets see how it works out 
 **edit 2 : ** i paid myself $ <unk> to get myself a drink after finishing the above task as it only took 30 minutes 
 i got ripped off $ <unk> but hey prices <unk> this happened today at my telco as i was taking calls on senior line 
 when we heard about this <unk> of usernames and passwords earlier today we very quickly all understood neither gmail itself nor <unk> had been <unk> 
 we quickly needed to remind frontline staff that either way the whole thing had nothing to do with *us* as they were *of course* getting calls about it from some users because ... reasons 
 the topic made some <unk> today sometimes in a <unk> fashion that suggested gmail itself was compromised or that the data was generally current and accurate 
 what was actually hacked is a series of websites with shady security and plaintext passwords 
 well known names include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> etc - whom were compromised sometimes several years ago 
 stolen email addresses of accounts associated with three mail providers were published but the accuracy of the passwords appear rather low 
 usernames are accurate but a user would need to have used the same password on both the major mail provider and the compromised website and then go on to never change it for it to pause a problem but on 10 million ... yeah there 's going to be *many* valid credentials held by people who do n't care or do n't know better 
 what does that have to do with a <unk> telco 
 we thought <unk> until i got this call ... & gt bytewave : senior line bytewave you may send me your ticket '' 
 & gt patrick : hey bytewave going to need a second opinion on this '' 
 he worked senior line on a temporary basis meaning he passed all our exams so i know he 's good and the call will go straight to the point 
 & gt patrick : lady here says she ca n't log in her email 
 we can go in fine so i was about to say it 's on her end but she tested it on two computers and her tablet with multiple browsers with or without router same deal 
 everything else works 
 so i had her disable wifi on her smartphone and using data it went through 
 mail provisioning is obviously fine 
 got any idea '' 
 he had already gone through all the normal troubleshooting kind of call i like 
 & gt bytewave : okay so mail <unk> fails only for her cable modem 's ip address 
 that 's new or rather that 's quite old 
 we have n't done ip bans to the mail servers since the spam age and there 's no notes about it 
 but i ca n't think of anything else '' 
 even then it was rarely used 99 % of the time we 'd disconnect problem users but there were special cases when such tools were <unk> like a customer with multiple static ips with only one offender or blocking a single network adapter causing problems from an open wifi spot 
 i follow my gut instinct and dig up a very old <unk> to an intranet page where such bans of ips or network adapters were listed automatically 
 it 's still up after all these years later 
 annddd my customer 's ip and two of her mac addresses are blocked from the pop and smtp with recent timestamps no notes anywhere 
 normally this must be <unk> by internal security 
 i put patrick on hold 
 is has no answers for me they say they 're the only ones supposed to do it but if it had been them there would be a flag on the account and they did n't touch it 
 okay then the only others i can think of with access are the mail admins 
 & gt bytewave : bytewave with senior staff i have blacklisted network adapters and a single ip address without is approval 
 they have n't used this in a long time i just wanted to see if ... '' & gt mailsystems : yeah i 'm your guy 
 i got an alert earlier that failed pop login attempts with non-existent usernames were spiking through the roof 
 honestly took me hours to get to it but then i found out they 're *all* from this ip 
 i did n't wait for is i 'd have just disabled the modem but we lost access to provisioning tools in the security review '' 
 it takes a second to sink in that there 's still major telco whose pop server <unk> any automatic lockout even after thousands of attempts with invalid logins 
 sure we 'll lock out a specific account if you type the wrong password a few times 
 <unk> different accounts you hit once each 
 if the mail admin gets to it maybe he 'll care to do something about it manually in four hours or so ... & gt bytewave : so you 're telling me the pop got hammered by some script with random usernames 
 any matches or breaches '' 
 & gt mailsystems : that 's the good part 
 there 's well less than half a percent of valid addresses which is very low but the attacker got into a few still which is n't the end of the world but <unk> into a somewhat worrying <unk> of <unk> amongst valid boxes 
 seems like he had some sort of partial data on passwords and it operated damn fast too 
 i 'm getting is on it as soon as i 'm done typing it up and i 'm monitoring this should be fine on my end 
 your end-user will get a call from them '' 
 & gt bytewave : wait this is too juicy to just pawn off i have a theory i can test right now 
 are you swamped 
 because if you have five minutes i need some of the addresses both failures and those that got through '' 
 & gt mailsystems : no fires to put out why not '' 
 i assume by now that password leak must be spread pretty widely it 's the internet after all 
 i bypass the work proxy with my usual clean wifi and the internet delivers as usual 
 takes about a minute to find and <unk> it 
 i <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk> right away 
 a ton of our customers use gmail though 
 open that in <unk> 
 just a long list of gmail addresses with passwords stolen from 3rd parties that may or may not work anymore 
 & gt mailsystems - chat : here 's some of those that do n't exist in our system and just bounced ... <unk> <unk> he sends me several of course all in @ <unk> form 
 i change <unk> @ <unk> for <unk> @ <unk> boom it 's on the list 
 after three on three i 'm sold 
 & gt bytewave : its the damn credentials leak 
 the script <unk> on the other end is just <unk> for people who might also be our customers using <unk> addresses on both our domain and gmail 's and who are still reusing the same password 
 he just got lucky a few times but out of these 5 million there 's <unk> quite a few more 
 dawned on me that any large isp with similarly shitty mail security could be hammered in the same way for a few <unk> of valid accounts of random people reusing usernames and passwords everywhere - though it 's anyone 's guess what could be gained from that 
 and you 'd most likely be locked out <unk> elsewhere anyhow 
 & gt mailsystems : yeah with those numbers i figured the attacker needed some source of at least partially valid data that makes sense 
 we 're just setting up a temp ban for multiple wrong usernames should prevent further attempts 
 i checked the accounts he got in too ... little of value was <unk> 
 we 'll coordinate with is then 
 that temp ban <unk> should have been up long ago 
 by now i 've kind of figured the lady we had on the phone was n't our <unk> <unk> for random valid logins 
 more than likely the other email address registered in her account that ended with a <unk> belonged to the guilty party 
 most likely a 16 years old <unk> i search for that username and with much irony reusing usernames ... find every trace of online life you can expect from a <unk> teenager up to and including a reddit account under that very name 
 annddd he posted a comment in a post about the password leak 
 if you 're reading this : <unk> clap 
 * at least he 's not reusing passwords 
 & gt bytewave : okay i 'll coordinate with you but would you have a use for the script that was used 
 i know you ca n't see billing data but this account belongs to a lady with a teenager who is likely responsible there 's decent <unk> evidence 
 we could probably ... '' & gt mailsystems : nah write it all down for is but we 're not running such a script <unk> on my watch 
 we 're lucky it just caused a slight <unk> you know how old the hardware is right 
 besides people reusing usernames and passwords are beyond any mail admin 's help '' 
 right 
 out of my hands then so i just filed everything down to the <unk> reddit comment from someone using the same <unk> as the customer 's kid 
 i was forced to tell patrick that even though we had found the cause of the problem she 'd need to wait for our security team to call her before we could explain the details 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 i used to work as a student worker for a college where i provided support for anything and everything that needed support printers ad av setups lab deployments scripts cable runs ad and pretty much anything you could think of or <unk> told me to do 
 this tale is about one of the most awkward situations that i 've ever had happen doing a task that is really simple 
 anyways one morning i get an email : & gt nurse : '' hey i was wondering if i could have <unk> '' added to my office computer '' 
 now a word about this or campus had a large number of printers it had been set up so administrators would have to physically add the printer to computers as some of them we did n't want anyone and everyone to be able to print to such as <unk> <unk> and some color printers 
 anyways their office was literally across the hall from our lab so i figured i would go down and do it n person 
 so i go to her office 
 & gt **nurse : ** '' ohh hey <unk> here to set up the printer '' 
 & gt **me : ** '' yep should n't take long just have to log in and add the printer '' & gt **nurse : *** '' alright i was n't doing on anything go ahead '' i sit down and get started now a word about how we are set up 
 everything is on roaming profiles so if a teacher logs into a classroom system they easily have access to all their files they do n't have to worry about using a flash drive or using a network share or have to learn anything they can just log in and they will be there in their documents 
 this is where it gets interesting the second i log in i see the user start to tear up and she asks : & gt **nurse : ** '' is that your cat 
 *pointing at my desktop <unk> '' & gt **me : ** '' yep thats my <unk> '' & gt **nurse : ** '' my cat <unk> just passed away last night he looks like a sweet heart *pointing at my <unk> '' & gt **me : ** '' i 'm sorry to hear that ... '' & gt **nurse : ** '' here is a picture of him ... '' after adding the printer she showed me pictures of her and her cat it was actually kind of sweet afterwards she thanked me and gave me a hug and a picture of her cat and a packet of hot <unk> mix 
 she even sent an email to <unk> about how sweet i am and asked that if i 'm available i deal with her which is n't a problem as she is actually a nice person who is willing to listen and trouble shoot 
 **tldr : **go to install printer end up helping a user cope with the loss of her <unk> posted this story about about traffic powered wireless and people seemed interested in my story about the <unk> daughter 
 so here it is 
 i was doing my normal shift helping customers with their broadband television and phoneline <unk> and i got a call i 'll never forget 
 this was a few years ago when i was <unk> green 
 i 've had my fair share of crazies 
 tin foil hat style 
 <unk> paranoid 
 we tend to humour them but this girl was different and changed the way i view the crazies 
 so here it is 
 & gt me : hi there you 're speaking with <unk> how can i help 
 *she sounds really <unk> & gt pars : hi there my names paranoid and rightly so 
 i really need your help i think someone is hacking our phone line 
 we need to get this fixed 
 *alarm bells ring 
 ok let 's humour <unk> & gt me : ok let 's have a look 
 what makes you think your line is being hacked 
 & gt pars : well 
 my father is a judge and he 's <unk> over a major case 
 a few of the people involved in the case were <unk> me a few weeks ago when they managed to hack my apple details so they could follow me around using the gps information in order to scare me 
 i managed to get that sorted but now i think they are listening to our phone calls 
 i 'm so scared 
 you need to help us 
 <unk> i <unk> think this <unk> is a <unk> who thinks the <unk> will be coming to pick her up soon 
 so i open google and search judge <unk> 
 sure enough top result is a wikipedia page of this girls father 
 i still think she 's a <unk> <unk> & gt me : ok let 's have a look 
 your line seems fine on this end and since there does n't seem to be a fault with the line the only way i can send someone out to investigate the line would be <unk> call out 
 & gt pars : yes that 's fine 
 when can you get someone out 
 *so i book her out a technician to my surprise as the crazies normally back out when you tell them their paranoia will cost them <unk> 
 i save her account details out of curiosity and check them a couple days later when the tech had visited 
 turned out the technician found a strange device on her line which should n't have been there ... so turned out she was right 
 * *her dad must have been into some proper shit 
 * **tl dr** : do n't judge a fruit loop by it 's colour 
 a manager of a department in my warehouse <unk> me on our im app and told me that she had sent too many jobs '' to a label printer which is on the network 
 i come in she tells me it just keeps printing i ca n't stop it '' 
 i take a look and there were about 47 <unk> with a b jobs going to the printer 
 i go on the server cancel the jobs and all was well 
 i asked why she did n't put a ticket in or call me on the radio 
 she said she was too embarrassed to do either 
 it turns out she had scanned a bar code into the print <unk> field 
 after law school i did some contract document review 
 while dull it was lucrative 
 it entails sitting in front of a screen looking at documents and reading other people 's email and figuring out if they were useful for a filed lawsuit 
 any <unk> <unk> were beaten out of me by doing this 
 in order to keep us productive internet access was <unk> off 
 since the document images were hosted remotely i realized that there might be a way around this 
 after a bit of poking around i realized that internet explorer was locked down and only able to view the document hosting sites 
 the leasing company had set these machines up and was n't available to unlock them 
 to get around this i installed the portable version of firefox on a usb drive so i could browse the internet during breaks 
 eventually this came to the notice of the <unk> managing the <unk> 
 instead of getting in trouble she found this <unk> 
 i soon got pressed into offering tech support for the rest of the team especially when we needed to obtain and distribute documents from sites barred by the restrictive policy 
 i had a few additional usb drives that i offered to my friends 
 one is grace a delightful older woman without much technical savvy 
 grace looks at me browsing the web after inserting the usb drive 
 grace : '' so that 's why you can browse the web and we ca n't '' me : '' yep '' grace : '' that 's amazing '' me : '' i guess '' grace : '' you can fit the entire internet on that little drive '' fateful short tale from this morning : user calls up blowing up that she ca n't search for files on the server 
 & gt see i go into the folder where i save them and they are all there but when i search only one shows up '' 
 this person has invoices going back about two years in this folder 
 & gt user <unk> to type in invoice '' & gt 1 file appears invoice <unk> <unk> '' i check back to the folder location - every single document had been spelt invioce sheet <unk> apart from the one file where invoice was spelt correctly and sheet was spelt wrong 
 back to the vnc session and i type in invioce '' and hundreds of documents appear in the search window & gt ... ... um ... ... i 'm really really sorry for wasting your time ... thanks *click* '' wednesday 's <unk> month i received a call from one of my frequent fliers 
 & gt me : internal it helpdesk this is <unk> how may i help you 
 & gt her : hi i ca n't get to $ <unk> & gt me : what happens when you try 
 & gt her : it wo n't come up 
 & gt me : hmmm ... that 's not good 
 let 's make sure its not an internet issue 
 & gt her : it 's not 
 & gt me : humor me 
 could you try going to $ <unk> 
 & gt her : * pause * it wo n't load either 
 & gt me : okay well in that case let 's let windows run its <unk> on the internet connection 
 & gt her : the connection is fine the internet is working 
 & gt me : how can you be so sure 
 & gt her : i keep getting a time <unk> page when i try and go places 
 & gt me : that 's odd ... .what does it say 
 & gt her : easy ways to pay your bill '' 
 before my current place of employment i had a support job with a moderate sized company that <unk> tape backup and anti-virus software 
 wonderful company to work at before they got bought out great boss and mostly wonderful co-workers 
 the following is one of the cases i picked up while i worked there ... fm : thank you for calling $ <unk> this is <unk> how can i help you today 
 pebkac : your backup software keeps destroying my tape drives who do i talk to about submitting a bill to have you replace the drives you destroyed 
 ok this is a new one on me 
 the software runs on the server and does nothing but issue scsi read/write commands against the device ... fm : i 'm sorry sir but what do you mean by destroys your tape drive '' 
 pebkac : well i 'll attach the tape drive to the server it 'll work for 3-4 days then it stops working 
 we 're no longer able to read or write to the tapes 
 your software has destroyed four of my tape drives this is the fifth one about to go out and i need you to replace them 
 seriously down four tape drives and you keep plugging them in 
 fm : ok sir 
 the software only runs on the server and it only issues scsi commands to the tape drive it does n't really have a way to affect the hardware device 
 you say your current drive is starting to exhibit errors 
 pebkac : yes i need another drive immediately who from your company can i send the invoice to since you 're destroying my drives 
 fm : let 's see if there 's something else going on first 
 can you please go into the tape engine service check the box for <unk> and kick off a quick backup 
 pebkac : i can but you 're just going to owe me a new drive 
 sure we will ... he runs the backup takes about five minutes and i have him email me the logs 
 first thing i notice is that he 's using an <unk> tape drive 
 nice second thing i notice is the drive telling me the make of tape 
 hmmm funny but i do n't remember that tape being valid for that model drive 
 pull up the <unk> website look at the tape drive and sure enough the tape he 's using has a <unk> <unk> higher than the tape drive supports 
 whenever he does a backup using these tapes he 's effectively <unk> the read/write heads off the tape drive 
 fm : sir i think i 've found your problem 
 can you open the log up you sent me 
 i need you to look at a couple of things 
 pebkac : ok. fm : sir see on this line where it displays the tape drive model 
 pebkac : yes 
 fm : great and do you see here where it shows the tape you 're using 
 pebkac : yes that 's the tape we 've got 
 i do n't understand why you 're showing me this i need a new tape drive immediately 
 fm : yes sir ... now if you can go to this url & lt point him to the specs for the tape drive & gt 
 pebkac : ok ... fm : do you see here where it shows the tape models you 're allowed to use with this drive and the warning message that using different model tapes can cause irreparable permanent damage ... <unk> : ... fm : you need to switch to one of the models of tape supported with this drive sir 
 is there anything else i can do to assist you today 
 pebkac : ... fm : thank you for calling $ <unk> have a nice day 
 if you enjoyed this which would you like to hear next : the customer who used the birthday scheme for their addressing or my co-worker i had to back fill on site because he burned a hole in his eye 
 edit : thank you kind <unk> for the gold a couple doors down in the industrial park from dishonest used car dealership was a shop that built <unk> and <unk> 
 we hated each other 
 when i got hired on as a service <unk> the guy i was replacing pulled me aside and shared some wisdom saying & gt <unk> kid 
 there’s three things you got ta get if you’re gon na work here 
 1. rom and the amazon are a $ $ holes 
 2. sales wins every argument and 3. we hate those f # <unk> at the kayak place.” the war had been going on so long that no one could even remember who had fired the first <unk> nor what specific disagreement had even sparked the conflict 
 we only knew where the current front in the war was and that front was in the parking lot 
 those animals at the kayak place for some reason absolutely <unk> how many cars we had in the back lot 
 it shouldn’t have been an issue : the back lot was <unk> in size and was never more than half full 
 our lease specifically granted us use of 60 parking spots and we never used more than about <unk> and you know guess what : if you move into the same complex as a used car dealership you shouldn’t be super surprised if there are some used cars parked around 
 none of these facts mattered to the <unk> at the kayak place 
 each morning i would come in park the jeep and walk into the back door with eyes like daggers glaring out at me from the kayak <unk> <unk> back door 
 some time around noon like clockwork the <unk> <unk> over there would march out to the lot and painstakingly count the cars that belonged to us grumbling the entire time about how many there were 
 twice a month or so we’d get a <unk> phone call from the landlady telling us that she had received complaints that we had upwards of 100 cars on the lot in spite of there only being a third of that 
 it had all gotten a little ridiculous 
 one friday it boiled over 
 *** this particular friday was <unk> slow for us slow enough that i actually had some downtime 
 the <unk> switch in the jeep was on the <unk> and it doesn’t come out without removing the entire <unk> dash bezel 
 late <unk> <unk> are just complete <unk> cars - the dashboard is all <unk> but some <unk> put a parts-bin <unk> steering column in and the two do *not* play well together 
 now age the plastic 15 years in the sun until it’s good and <unk> 
 getting the extremely fragile and yet completely enormous dash bezel out is a careful <unk> of nervous sweating and cursing <unk> you snap the bezel in two around the narrow steering column cutout 
 i’ve been at it for a good ten minutes trying desperately to sneak the tiny column cutout on the bezel past a steering column the size of the moon when someone starts shouting 
 & gt <unk> 
 hey 
 who’s the f # ckin’ boss here ” i <unk> over the dashboard and saw the alpha male of the kayak herd standing in the bay door 
 i rolled my eyes and acknowledged his existence 
 & gt me : “hey i’m in here 
 what can i do for you ” & gt chief kayak : “yeah 
 yeah you the boss ” & gt me : <unk> of 
 look i’m kind of in the middle of something delicate can this wait ” & gt ck : “yeah well look you f # ck i wan na talk to the boss about all these f # ckin’ cahs out here.” & gt me : <unk> that case we’re an <unk> <unk> & gt ck : “i’m sick’a all these f # ckin’ cahs in the f # ckin’ lot 
 there’s too many f # ckin’ cahs ” & gt me : “my count says there’s 36 that belong to us today 
 i can recount ‘em if you want but we’re well below the 60 we’re allowed on the <unk> & gt ck : <unk> 
 36 that’s horse $ hit 
 there’s got ta be a hundred out there ” & gt me : <unk> and not all of them belong to us 
 it might surprise you to learn this but we don’t own every single car in the world 
 now if you don’t mind i’m trying to do something very delicate here and i need to <unk> i turned and started back trying to coax the dash bezel out past the column 
 maybe he’d take the hint 
 he didn’t 
 my ignoring him only further <unk> his rage and he began shouting directly in my ear 
 & gt ck : “i’m sick’a this $ hit 
 you know what 
 i’ve been talkin’ to my lawyer 
 yeah 
 we’ve been talkin’ all day about what to do about yous f # cks 
 you get all these f # ckin’ cahs moved now or you’re gon na hear from him 
 and while you’re at it you can go f # ck <unk> ” & gt <unk> f # ck 
 f # ck f # ck f # ck 
 it was all i could do to keep from taking the broken pieces of dashboard bezel and smashing them over his head 
 & gt me : “i’m afraid you’ve said the magic <unk> and at this point i’m forced to terminate this conversation 
 any further contact with any employees of this company will need to be directed through our counsel 
 i will also have to ask you to leave the premises 
 have a good <unk> & gt ck : “no i ain’t done with you 
 you get in these f # ckin’ cahs and you move ‘em now 
 now ” by this point colossal redneck and the raver had come out to the bay to see what all the commotion was about 
 colossal redneck walked up to chief kayak and got up in his face 
 & gt cr : “the man told you to leave 
 this here’s private property and y’all is <unk> the <unk> of <unk> started to say something but colossal redneck just stepped back a pace flipped out his phone and dialed 
 & gt cr : <unk> 
 <unk> colossal redneck at dishonest used car dealership 
 we got ourselves a <unk> 
 y’all <unk> wan na come take care of <unk> or should i just do it myself ” colossal redneck would have easily weighed in at 300 <unk> after a month of <unk> and he had a good foot on the <unk> from the kayak place 
 i’ve been in enough fights to know that you don’t take on the big guy and the primitive standing in my bay apparently had gotten the memo as well 
 he retreated and colossal redneck called off the cops 
 *** & gt <unk> 
 <unk> the owners colossal redneck miami vice and i rolled into the lot at about the same time the next monday and found a disaster 
 about 10 of our cars had been keyed 
 and not just keyed but <unk> 
 * two <unk> were smashed <unk> were <unk> it was a mess 
 of course we immediately knew who had done it 
 colossal redneck filed a police report the amazon got in touch with our insurance agent who surely was going to drop us this time and rom and i dug into the security camera footage to see what it caught 
 a blurry pickup pulled into the lot late sunday night and two blurry humanoids in blurry <unk> piled out 
 the humanoids had blurry items in their hands and did blurry things to blurry cars 
 & gt rom : “why can’t we see anything ” & gt me : “how much did you pay for this camera ” & gt rom : “it was on sale at radio <unk> & gt me : “that’s <unk> we had nothing we could pin him with 
 *** & gt *pfoot bang… pfoot bang… pfoot bang* oh <unk> weird noises coming from the service bay 
 i walked out and discovered felonious monk <unk> a pile of splice connectors 
 & gt me : <unk> what would you say you are… doing ” & gt fm : “check this out 
 you take a splice connector and you fill it full of hot glue and then once it <unk> you stuff it in the tip of a blow gun 
 and then watch this $ hit ” felonious monk grabbed one of his <unk> <unk> and stuffed it in the end of a blow gun 
 he connected the blow gun to the air compressor and pointed it outside 
 & gt *pfoot bang* the blow gun launched its <unk> at somewhere approaching the speed of sound sending it all the way to <unk> <unk> <unk> slamming into their bay door and leaving a <unk> dent 
 the back door of the kayak place opened and a face <unk> out of the shadows 
 & gt ck : “hey 
 hey yous f # cks 
 i know it’s you making that <unk> 
 quit f # cking with my bay door ” i smiled and waved 
 felonious monk did a little jig 
 & gt ck : “f # ck all you f # ckin’ a $ $ holes ” the door slammed 
 felonious monk stuffed another missile into the <unk> 
 & gt *pfoot bang* felonious monk shot me a grin 
 & gt fm : “i figure i just do that every <unk> and maybe he’ll go <unk> & gt me : “he’s already <unk> & gt fm : “well i dunno 
 maybe he’ll kill <unk> & gt me : “well i obviously can’t <unk> this kind of behavior but it does look like you’re getting a little low on splice connectors 
 i’ll order another couple of boxes for the afternoon <unk> *** things were quiet for the next couple of weeks 
 a couple times a day felonious monk or one of the other technicians would launch a few splice connectors over toward our <unk> enemies just enough to keep them on their toes over there 
 their bay door was beginning to look like it had a bad case of <unk> 
 then one <unk> tuesday i got a call from the landlady 
 & gt me : <unk> this <unk> & gt ll : “60 cars 
 that’s how many you can have 
 60 cars 
 60.” & gt me : <unk> aware 
 i’ve got <unk> out there right now give or take one or two 
 you can drop by and count them if you <unk> & gt ll : “i don’t care how many you’ve got i’m sick of getting these calls that you have too many cars 
 <unk> you get 60.” this was fairly typical for the landlady 
 any conversation eventually <unk> into her just repeating the same few words <unk> until you hung up 
 luckily just then the diplomat walked by my office on her way to lunch 
 you may remember her as the young lady we hired to handle red tape for us 
 she was unbelievably <unk> 
 i waved her over 
 & gt me : “hey landlady just real quick there’s somebody here who can handle this issue better than me.” i put her on hold and filled in the diplomat 
 she took the phone and worked her magic 
 & gt td : <unk> 
 hey look we know you’re sick of making these calls and we don’t want you to be <unk> with this kind of stuff 
 you’ve got a lot on your plate to handle and a dumb parking dispute has got to be unbelievably trivial for you to have to bother with 
 look we know it was chief kayak filing the complaints because he’s been over here threatening us with lawyers over the same issue 
 if you’d like and the <unk> is willing we would like to sit down with you and him and see if we can come to some kind of <unk> agreement 
 really 
 great 
 hey when you come can you bring a copy of <unk> <unk> 
 i just want to go over them with the group to make sure we’re in compliance and not <unk> upon what they have promised in their own lease you know 
 great 
 friday at noon 
 awesome 
 thank you ” she tossed the phone onto the hook gave me a grin and disappeared 
 *** noon on friday rolled around and i found myself with the diplomat the landlady and chief kayak all crowded in my office 
 the landlady pulled out our lease and slid it across the table to the diplomat 
 & gt td : “if no one minds i’d also like to see the lease for the kayak place 
 you don’t mind do you ” & gt ck : “why ” & gt td : “i’m guessing what’s going on here is that you’ve been given a bunch of spaces in the lot and we’ve been given a bunch of spaces in the lot and together it’s more spaces than there are parking spaces in the lot you know 
 and then you come in and the lot is full with our <unk> i had no idea what she was up to 
 the lot was never even close to full 
 half full at most 
 she smiled at chief kayak 
 & gt td : “so you don’t mind if i just have a quick look do you ” & gt ck : <unk> i guess <unk> the landlady shrugged and looked through her <unk> pulling out the kayak <unk> lease 
 while the diplomat slowly read through the two <unk> chief kayak amused himself by working himself up into a <unk> 
 <unk> hateful deeply <unk> accusations were <unk> against us 
 & gt ck : <unk> f # cks always have all these f # ckin’ cahs in the lot 
 there’s hundreds of ‘em 
 and worse yet now yous f # cks are <unk> some kinda thing at my bay door 
 it’s all covered in <unk> from you f # ckin’ <unk> ” i bit the inside of my <unk> to keep from grinning 
 & gt ck : “i’m sick’a all the f # ckin’ cahs 
 they got ta go all the f # ckin’ cahs 
 <unk> <unk> my shop look like it’s in a <unk> 
 it’s like we’re on the set of *the <unk> or <unk> ” & gt me : <unk> and <unk> & gt ck : <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ” the landlady chimed in with her usual admonishment 
 & gt ll : “60 cars 
 you can only have 60 cars 
 no more than 60 <unk> before the landlady could repeat herself once again or chief kayak could work himself up into another crazed rant the diplomat chimed in 
 & gt td : “i’m sorry to interrupt but i think i’ve found something 
 as everyone will note our lease does show we can occupy up to <unk> what i’d like to do is go outside with everyone and count how many we’ve got just to show everyone we’re in <unk> we walked outside and i counted our cars for everyone 
 35 today 
 & gt td : “so there’s still a bunch of other cars on the lot 
 <unk> who do those belong to ” & gt me : “i’m not sure 
 i see a couple parked in front of the <unk> place - i suppose those belong to them 
 and then the <unk> over there has five or six 
 and then the rest i assume belong to the kayak place.” & gt td : “is that right chief kayak 
 how many cars do you have on the lot today ” & gt ck : “i dunno there’s the <unk> and me and the delivery <unk> so that’s like 20 cahs 
 so what ” & gt td : “well that’s interesting because your lease only gives you fifteen parking <unk> the look of “oh $ <unk> on his face was delicious to watch 
 & gt ck : “what 
 lem me see that.” chief kayak snatched the lease from the diplomat and she indicated where in the fine print she was reading 
 the landlady immediately chimed in 
 & gt ll : <unk> 
 that’s how many cars you get 
 fifteen cars 
 you get fifteen 
 fifteen cars ” & gt me : “you know ms. landlady it sounds like there are a bunch of cars on this lot that are <unk> parked 
 i’d be more than happy to grab our tow rig and remove them for you.” the landlady threw up her hands in disgust at the lot of us and divorced herself from the group walking off to her car 
 chief kayak turned <unk> and retreated back to the <unk> hole from <unk> he had come <unk> only briefly to turn and shout & gt <unk> ain’t the last you’ve heard of this you f # ckin’ a $ $ holes ” *** epilogue : it was in fact the last us <unk> a $ $ holes heard about it though the following monday five of his employees were <unk> parked on the street 
 that evening i stood in the bay with the technicians carefully filling splice connectors with hot glue 
 & gt *pfoot bang… pfoot bang… pfoot bang* we hate those <unk> at the kayak <unk> let 's visit the magical land of what the absolute fuck 
 working at a small company budget is a major concern 
 so if it can be done cheap great free is better 
 i come in one morning to find the boss has performed one of their audits '' of my computer 
 having already configured <unk> i never understood why they needed to go to computers 
 then again they did n't seem to have a clue what they were doing 
 these audits consisted of looking around for files and applications they do n't know and deleting them 
 i wrote code examples like <unk> <unk> to demonstrate how things could be implemented 
 they were deleted to prevent them accidentally being included in release builds 
 two branches of source code better delete one ... which one 
 better delete them both so they know not to have multiple copies 
 that reminds me i better ask where we are up to with the new features they were writing 
 i would come back to databases being deleted 
 migration projects gone 
 database engines gone 
 i open outlook to see they have once more removed the reading pane 
 oh look they have moved all my email and forwarded them all to themselves 
 oh joy i <unk> a day of you received an email 3 years ago <unk> at y about z can i mark this as resolved '' 
 there is an email from them at <unk> 
 it has been noted that hardcore pornography was on your computer '' 
 unsure what constitutes hardcore these days i email back was this email meant for me 
 i am not sure what you mean '' 
 after only a few seconds i receive an email back with on your computer you had a file called gimp that contained pornography '' 
 do you mean gimp the <unk> image <unk> package 
 i used last week to edit graphics for a client as we do not have photoshop '' 
 we have photoshop 
 i will bring it in 
 it 's the latest version you can get and it cost us a fortune '' 
 they brought in <unk> 
 i was expecting cs 5. it appeared to have been bought at a rummage sale and i was told not to activate it 
 gimp was never mentioned again 
 tl : dr the gimp 's <unk> the hospital i work at we have portable workstations that use these big <unk> batteries to power them and i 've tasked myself with going through and <unk> the locations of each of the chargers because we 've got a couple listed as <unk> '' that have bad batteries reporting back to the manufacturer 
 so i get in and get through 5 floors and on the next floor as i 'm looking for the chargers i was told that there was a mobile workstation called a wow for workstation on <unk> that was n't responding to <unk> keyboard or mouse input 
 usually this means it has a crappy <unk> plastic hub and just needs to have the power and b connector disconnected and reconnected 
 i tried that first and it did n't work 
 crap 
 now i have to take it apart to replace the old style hub with our newer ones 
 as i 'm taking it apart i 'm noticing that the screws are loose as hell the wires are n't managed properly and i started complaining quietly to myself trying to figure out what moron did this wow previously 
 so 45 minutes later i get everything <unk> back up i tighten the screws properly and <unk> strip the wires so it 's more <unk> pleasing and better tucked away 
 i return the wow back to the floor and go back to my charger inventory duties and 20 minutes later it hits me i worked on that wow about a month after i started here 
 and i remember bitching about the other techs <unk> the hell out of the screws 
 so the <unk> was me 
 it goes to show you that everyone can have an off day including you 
 i 'm new here so this might not be correct format but here it goes 
 years ago i worked tech support for a company and about 75 % of my work were taking calls from customers who locked themselves out of our website 
 it 's a very simple and basic website for customers to manage their accounts 
 one of the most memorable calls i received was from a customer locking themselves out and needing a password reset 
 it went like this 
 **idiocracy13 : ** thank you for calling i can i assist you today 
 **customer : ** your website sucks and i ca n't login 
 **idiocracy13 : ** i apologize about that 
 can i have your name and account number 
 **customer : ** jesus insert expletive here christ why ca n't you pull it up with my phone number that shows up on your screen 
 **idiocracy13 : ** if you do n't have your account number handy i can pull it up with the phone number but i still need your name 
 **customer : ** i do n't have time for this 
 fine 
 it 's customers name 
 now can you insert expletive here help me 
 <unk> : thank you for that information but lets try to keep this call professional and refrain from using profanity 
 so what seems to be the problem when you attempt to login 
 my company advised us reps that if a customer started using profanity and/or became abusive we could give a warning and disconnect if it continued **customer : ** look i 'm a millionaire and i can speak however the hell i want 
 we spend a lot of money with you guys they did n't and i will cancel this account if you do n't help me get on your god damn website 
 my username wo n't work so fix it 
 **idiocracy13 : ** i apologize you are having trouble on our website what is the username you are using 
 **customer : ** customer12321 **idiocracy13 : ** thank you 
 i see that it has been locked out 
 i have unlocked it and reset your password 
 is your email still customer12321 @ <unk> 
 **customer : ** yes now why did you have to reset it 
 it 's always the same with you people 
 i used the right insert expletive here password so it should n't have been locked out 
 **idiocracy13 : ** ma'am i 'm going to have to ask you again to refrain <unk> using profanity 
 if it happens again i will disconnect the call 
 the reason your password was reset is because anytime a username is locked our system will automatically generate a new password and email to the email address on file 
 have you gotten the email 
 **customer : ** are you trying to say i am stupid and do n't know how the internet works 
 i am a millionaire and obviously very successful and know a lot about computers 
 **idiocracy13 : ** i am not saying you are stupid i am just explaining how the process works 
 did you get the email yet 
 **customer : ** yes **idiocracy13 : ** thank you 
 can you please trying logging in again with the temporary password 
 i 'll stay on the line with you 
 you can copy and paste it if you 'd like **customer : ** okay i just put the password in and it is n't taking it 
 this is ridiculous 
 i do n't know what you mean by copy and paste 
 **idiocracy13 : ** hmm okay 
 are you getting a specific error message 
 **customer : ** it just says it is n't correct 
 at this point in the call i usually start asking some basic troubleshooting questions 
 i asked her what os and browser she was using 
 both of which we support 
 then this happened 
 **idiocracy13 : ** can you make sure your caps lock is n't on 
 **customer : ** wow you guys really think i 'm an idiot do n't you 
 of course it 's not on 
 i 've been dealing with computers since the 70 's so i know how they work 
 **idiocracy13 : ** i am not saying that ma'am 
 i 'm just trying to help you login 
 can you do one last thing for me 
 can you type in your username and tell me if it 's all <unk> or lower case 
 **customer : ** it 's all big letters <unk> 
 **idiocracy13 : ** okay that means your caps lock is on 
 if you ... .. **customer : ** insert expletive here you and your company 
 *click* -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - i know it might not be as exciting as some of the tales on here but i guess some people truly believe their <unk> makes them experts 
 i was curious after that call and did a simple google search on her company 
 well it is n't even hers 
 it 's her husbands and she was labeled as the secretary 
 edit : some are questioning how i can remember it so well 
 well it was a recorded call and i saved all of my really crazy calls on my computer up until i quit a few months ago 
 i listened to a few of them on my last day and this happened to be one of them 
 they would n't let me take the call with me though : 
 i was a manager when i left and had been out of the tech call center for a bit 
 it may not be verbatim ... ... ... <unk> i 'm sure 90 % of the posts here are n't either 
 i hate making difficult phone calls the receiver starts getting heavy before you even pick it up 
 i pick up the phone 
 i can’t do this without coffee 
 i walk over to the kitchen and grab my cup 
 the boss picked up on the second ring 
 he was fast 
 & gt boss : hello 
 & gt me : hello mr president 
 its airz here i’m the security and it manager 
 & gt boss : oh yes 
 i’ve heard about you 
 how’s everything going 
 & gt me : not so great mr <unk> 
 & gt boss : let me speed things along a little 
 there has been a <unk> you’re worried about your audit and your budget situation is <unk> 
 & gt me : errr… coffee looked back up at me 
 it was instant 
 so fast 
 & gt boss : i do pay attention sometimes 
 & gt me : yes 
 a <unk> has <unk> 
 & gt boss : i wouldn’t worry about it 
 vp called me a while ago and told me not to worry 
 & gt me : i’m head of security though and a whole rack has gone missing 
 & gt boss : unfortunately i owe the vp quite a lot 
 i wouldn’t trust the guy as far as i could throw him but i do owe him 
 & gt me : sorry what 
 & gt boss : oh sorry i was off in my head again 
 not enough coffee… here’s what you do get the network back up then lock that room down 
 & gt me : police 
 insurance 
 & gt boss : no no 
 i owe the vp 
 he told me not to bother he said he’d cover it 
 & gt me : fix the network then lock the room down 
 & gt boss : yep 
 oh and make sure you’re the only one with a key 
 i sipped my coffee 
 tasted suspicious 
 & gt me : could i get that in writing 
 & gt boss : oh yes 
 don’t worry though i’ve got your back 
 just behind the scenes thats all 
 & gt me : thanks 
 after hanging up the phone i looked at my email 
 nothing new 
 not yet 
 next older stories - follow this if you 're a fan of <unk> order older stories - written order and all i work at a tech firm that services <unk> and businesses in the surrounding area 
 i 'm sure everyone here understands the basics of what that entails 
 this particular service call for one of our contracted clients a <unk> firm took place this past week 
 **client : ** tax <unk> is coming up pretty quick so we need to clear off some of our computers to make way for new temporary hires 
 **me : ** ok that should n't be a problem 
 what do you mean by clear off '' 
 **client : ** like make it so the new employees do n't have to use the old employees login and files that kind of thing 
 **me : ** alright well when the new employees start we 'll just need to create new user accounts for them on the server 
 once that 's done all they 'll need to do is sign in and begin working 
 **client : ** i do n't want them to have to use the old employees information 
 i want these computers cleared off so none of the old stuff is there 
 what do you call that 
 wipe and reload 
 *a feeling of dread begins to form in the pit of my stomach and a <unk> in the force tells me i 'm about to lose my cheery demeanor 
 * **me : ** you want to have windows reinstalled on all these computers 
 **client : ** yes so the new hires wo n't be using the old employees information 
 **me : ** they already wo n't be 
 they 'll be using their own logins that we 'll create when they are hired and all files are stored on the server 
 the old employee logins have already been <unk> so nobody could even use them if they wanted to 
 **client : ** well when you go to sign in it still has their name there 
 **me : ** ah i see what you 're saying 
 it 's quite simple to change that 
 all you need to <unk> **client : ** it may be simple to you but it 's not to me 
 i do n't want to spend a lot of time trying to figure it out 
 just clear the computers off for the new employees 
 <unk> begins to <unk> from my ears due to being cut off mid-sentence 
 * **me : ** i understand what you 're asking for 
 i 'm trying to tell you your computers are set up so that does n't need to be done 
 all you have to <unk> **client : ** *sigh* how long is this going to take 
 i have a lot to do and i need to get back to work 
 <unk> is beginning to cloud my <unk> and the steam <unk> from my ears is <unk> like a tea kettle 
 * **me <unk> : ** all you have to do is click the switch user '' button and type in the new username 
 **client : ** i do n't know where that button is 
 we 'll just call you guys when we start hiring some new people and you can help us then 
 <unk> off 
 * i stood there for a moment simultaneously dumbfounded and <unk> at the clients <unk> to learn what has to be the most simple task you can possibly do on a computer short of turning it on 
 tl dr - client wants complete windows <unk> on multiple domain workstations to get rid of former employee usernames at login 
 refuses to learn about the <unk> switch user '' button 
 drives me to <unk> my friendship with the captain 
 edit : it seems i forgot the most important point of this entire incident and now feel like an idiot 
 that 's what i get for typing this up at 3am 
 i mentioned the client is contracted but i forgot to detail what this means 
 the client pays a monthly rate for msp monitoring services and part of their contract is unlimited labor 
 any work i would have done would have been under this contract meaning we would have made no $ $ $ from going ahead and <unk> the computers and it would have ultimately been a colossal waste of <unk> staff 's line at my telco has a very secret direct priority number that <unk> everything 
 we not only refuse to write it down anywhere we even deny it exists at all unless someone has a valid reason to need it most of management are n't even aware it does 
 of course no matter how well you keep a secret anyone can punch in random numbers and <unk> end up talking to the prime <unk> 's secretary 
 in the same fashion anyone can hand out false random numbers to their credit card company 
 and so our secret number somehow ended up on the call sheet of a third party debt collection agency 
 it should be a simple matter of telling them 'i 'm not the justin mackenzie you 're looking for and that they 're calling a business line in a call center for them to take us off their sheet right 
 nope 
 we told them over and over and they kept calling 
 very unpleasant calls to boot as they operate on a 'bad cop principle where they assume you 're lying about your identity if you deny being their guy and berate you about being irresponsible repeatedly 
 several of us spoke to them but the caller was different everytime they 're a call center too and even though at first we took the time to convince them or even provide evidence everytime they told us they 'd stop calling we 'd get another angry call asking for justin the next day 
 i drew the line once their priority call fell on amelia who has the sweetest <unk> voice imaginable and the idiot on the other end <unk> her of being justin <unk> at which point she turned on speakerphone and i got to hear him scream she should pay <unk> bills or they 'd make <unk> parents pay them 
 i waved her to transfer it to me 
 & gt bytewave : justin mackenzie speaking please hold '' 
 & gt boss : the hell 
 how are we going to get them to stop calling now '' 
 & gt bytewave : i 'm just messing with them now i had to talk them down once already it 's enough 
 their <unk> all go through a single number we can block it '' 
 & gt boss : how do you know 
 it 's a confidential number for all we know each of them could have their own <unk> '' i point at one of my screens where i have a chat session open with a friend at switchboards 
 & gt bytewave im - inbound call at <unk> received at <unk> i need to know if the caller 's number matches other calls we got at this number on timestamps of the tickets for three other calls we got from them 
 & gt switchboards im - sec 
 & gt switchboards im - yeah 
 confidential number its xxx-555-1820 
 & gt boss : oh 
 good work 
 thanks about time this ends '' 
 i call switchboards with the muted collection call agent on the other line listening in 
 & gt bytewave : hey man 
 i need a <unk> ban from <unk> from that line you sent me xxx-555-1820 
 hell let 's throw in the subcontractors too '' 
 switchboards : sure thing 
 i just need a ticket for the records '' 
 & gt bytewave : sending now i attached the <unk> file where they 're accusing amelia of being a guy named justin who owes them some money and threatened her parents '' 
 & gt switchboards : you 're kidding me 
 why did n't she just explain that we 're $ telco and.. '' & gt bytewave : believe me we tried i had four timestamps remember 
 that 's just about half of it 
 all that can be said in their favor is that i 'd hate to owe them money 
 not because they 're good - because they 'd be too stupid to stop calling even once i paid my damn bills '' 
 & gt switchboards : done they ca n't connect to any of our work lines anymore 
 i used the broadest ban available '' 
 as he says this i see my muted line one just cut 
 switchboards is extra effective 
 & gt bytewave : thank you 
 next time you come out of the bunker let 's have some coffee '' 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 our cfo is a really awesome guy despite being <unk> with the presence of the terminator i 'm a <unk> girl with arms like a <unk> he 's very <unk> and i have a good <unk> driven relationship with him 
 he 's also pretty tech savvy which makes him a hell of a lot easier to deal with 
 i deployed a new voip soft phone to him last week he loves it and has had little issues with it 
 except for today 
 i 'm at lunch i check my phone and realise he has im 'd me and emailed me about an urgent issue with the soft phone client 
 since he pretty much runs our company i <unk> back to the office 
 walk into his office he <unk> at me the client is broken and he ca n't make calls 
 he tells me he 's very busy and important <unk> and that it needs to be fixed pronto he goes on to <unk> me about recommending this soft phone to him 
 i lean over and plug his usb headset back into the port it 'd fallen out and he 'd ignored the big red exclamation mark on the client telling him as much 
 i shake my head at him and walk out 
 he <unk> after me that he 's still very busy and important but not to tell anyone this happened 
 this is an off the clock it tale with a happy ending 
 i left for the night at company <unk> and stopped in for a beer at a local bar 
 four beers later i tried to pay the tab with my credit card 
 no cards under $ 20 '' 
 fine 
 i moved toward the atm and heard someone say do n't bother it 's broken '' 
 i noticed there was an error code on the atm display screen 
 natural reaction is to look up said error code 
 i googled the atm brand and error <unk> 
 obstruction in the cash <unk> '' 
 the obstruction was $ 100 crumpled up in the <unk> 
 thank you and goodnight 
 i got a support call this morning from a manager i was cooking breakfast when it came in so i was just partially listening to her issue 
 & gt her : this new printer is not working correctly it 's got wireless built in and it is hooked up to my laptop with a cable 
 but my husband ca n't print when i print to it ... & gt me : you mean when you print from your laptop hooked up directly he ca n't print over the wireless 
 & gt her : yeah when i print from my laptop he ca n't print from his laptop 
 i think back to the last time this manager needed help and decided to start with the dumb question end of the list 
 & gt me : so while you are printing to the printer he ca n't get it to print his document 
 & gt her : yeah when i am printing he ca n't print from his laptop 
 & gt me : um ... ok when your document is done does it print his next 
 & gt her : yes three copies of it for some reason ... & gt me : you think because it 's wireless he can print something while it 's printing your document right 
 & gt her : yeah that 's what it said on the box he explained that 's why he bought it 
 & gt me : oh so let me make sure i understand the situation 
 you can print from your company laptop to your personal printer 
 & gt her : yes but he ca n't print while i 'm printing 
 & gt me : he needs to call his tech support guy it 's working as far as i 'm concerned have a good day bye 
 *click* oops my cell phone is on silent and i seemed to have dropped it in the towel drawer under the towels ... i know tomorrow she is going to be in an ill mood but i swear sometimes i fear for future generations ... .do n't work in tech support but as the only teenager in the house i may as well be 
 backstory : my stepmother considers herself to be very <unk> with technology because and i quote 'i set the router up with 4 channels and every device is on a different channel 
 in reality the <unk> and <unk> networks were on by default and i turned on the guest network for her 
 my dad thinks she 's a genius as well 
 recently a lightning storm came through and actually fried the router 
 my dad and i head off the the shop to get a new one and my stepmother has no trust in either of us to get an actually good router because evidently nobody is as good as she is with technology 
 we get there and i <unk> manage to <unk> dad to get a netgear <unk> <unk> under the guise that the range will be long enough to reach his <unk> we live on a somewhat rural property and in fairness t does actually reach the shed but really i just wanted a gaming <unk> one where the <unk> would automatically prioritise me over my <unk> netflix <unk> 
 we arrive home and i begin to set it up and she walks over and tells me everything i 'm doing is wrong before i 'd touched anything 
 <unk> ... i began thinking knowing she 's inevitably fuck something up and i 'd have to sneak out and fix it later overnight while she claims the credit 
 naturally she ca n't make it work 
 note : the setup really was n't a hard process 
 all we really needed was my <unk> isp details and it does everything else automatically 
 i do n't understand how she could n't do it but it was my fault because i 'd touched it 
 important <unk> : my phone service is provided through the same isp but on my mothers account 
 eventually i get sent away from the router because i 'm obviously screwing everything up 
 the claim : the router could n't connect to the isp because it was trying to <unk> on to my phone 3g network and <unk> with the servers wirelessly 
 deciding the argument was n't worth it i left and upon returning to my room introduced my face to my desk 
 four hours later my dad and stepmother went for a walk and i fixed it in three minutes 
 tl dr : stepmother knows <unk> thinks she 's an it queen definitely is not 
 at a call center for dsl internet tech support for a major us phone company 
 a very angry lady calls in because my internet is down and my kid ca n't do her homework 
 she missed a due date and it 's all because of you '' 
 so i go through a bunch of troubleshooting and ultimately wind up writing a trouble ticket for a tech visit 
 her dsl modem is <unk> in her back yard 
 * in a tool shed apparently and we ran all the wires for it when we built the house '' 
 ok ma'am 
 got a field tech visit set up for you 
 earliest time window is in four days 
 advise her of possible charges if the problem is in her home wiring 
 she screams about that for a while : but my daughter ca n't do her homework at all 
 she 's been waiting for two days to do her homework and it 's late '' 
 i guess she forgot that earlier in the call she was also screaming at me because her daughter is home-schooled '' and thus has an extreme need for their internet connection 
 what i probably should have said : ma'am 
 since your daughter is home-schooled you are her teacher and you set the due dates 
 so perhaps you should just move her due date to allow for the internet being down '' 
 what i did say : nothing 
 i just let this <unk> church lady scream into my ear for nearly a half <unk> been a few years since i was desktop support but users still come to me for assistance rather than go through our wonderful <unk> 
 i’m sure many of you can relate 
 user sticks her head in my office first thing this morning and said she was having problems with her laptop and asked if i would be willing to take a look 
 she starts telling me how yesterday afternoon she started getting these pop-ups for a program that she hasn’t used in years 
 she used it daily when she was in a different department but insists that she no longer uses it 
 i was only half paying attention as it was still really early and i was on my first cup of coffee 
 we get to her office and try booting up her machine 
 pgp screen comes up and she enters in her password immediately we get a <unk> with the message <unk> boot <unk> i ask her which program she uninstalled 
 <unk> she <unk> she had no idea that pgp was used to encrypt her laptop even though she has to enter in her network password to get past the pgp encryption screen every time she boots up her machine 
 <unk> pgp allowed her to uninstall it without first <unk> the drive is beyond me 
 but yeah she used pgp years ago in her previous position and rather than go through protocol by contacting helpdesk and opening a ticket to resolve the pop-up issue pgp couldn’t find her keyring files she decided to just uninstall pgp 
 the person she shares an office with also used to be in it so she took over the efforts to try and get her back up and <unk> the drive connected it to another machine with pgp and started <unk> process 
 i would say i hope she’s learned her lesson but i kinda doubt it 
 lol <unk> apparently it caught wind that she was trying to get it fixed without having to send it off and they let her know that this was grounds for <unk> 
 so now she 'll be shipping it off and probably wo n't get it back until sometime next week 
 beautiful 
 - i work for the it department at a university 
 we have a few student workers who man the phones and create tickets to assign to my team 
 this morning one of the student workers tells me of a user who 's very upset has a very high pitched <unk> computer and a message on screen that says failed to boot '' 
 & gt me : what is the exact error message 
 <unk> to boot is not something i 've ever seen before and i do n't think that 's what the screen is actually saying '' 
 & gt sw : i do n't know i already hung up 
 can you please go look 
 she 's in the next building over 
 i did n't know what to do and she was very angry '' 
 <unk> so i walk over and have the user power on the computer 
 immediately i hear a repeated beeping not a whining or screaming 
 sounds like keyboard input in a <unk> menu 
 i look at the keyboard and the user 's stapler is laying on the <unk> key 
 it 's a dell machine 
 the message she was seeing on screen was the select boot device '' menu 
 tl dr stapler on boot menu key = irate luser 
 this is a tale from about 3 years ago back when i was in full time education 
 i had gained a reputation around my school as a geek '' as i knew how to set up projectors and use a different web browser to <unk> 
 & gt teacher in class : <unk> deputy_head needs your help with a computer go to her office 
 & gt me : ok. & gt deputy_head : i need to open this website but my email wo n't let me 
 i glance at the screen the school was running server 2003 and office 2010. she had ms outlook open with some kind of internal email open with a long web link that was partially selected 
 i think the html email was formatted <unk> so it <unk> and did n't wrap within the content of the email correctly 
 & gt deputy_head : it wo n't work 
 & gt me : so you need to get on to this website 
 & gt deputy_head : yes i tried to select it but it does n't work 
 i see that it 's a actual web link and not just text so i click on the link and <unk> opens usual expected behaviour 
 & gt deputy_head : what 
 how did you do that 
 & gt me : i clicked the <unk> what was the issue 
 & gt deputy_head : how did you do that 
 & gt me : i clicked on the link like this 
 & gt deputy_head : looking like the sky just fell down wow 
 i did n't know you could do that 
 & gt me : yup try it yourself 
 she very <unk> navigates on to the link and does a <unk> left click on the link 
 it opens again 
 she then lifts her finger off the mouse 
 & gt me : yup you can just do a click 
 & gt deputy_head : wow 
 i never knew 
 she eventually got the hang of it after i showed her 3 times more and with a few different emails she also had issues with 
 previously she 'd been manually selecting the text right clicking and then <unk> into the url bar 
 this woman was in her late 30s and had used pc 's for years 
 won <unk> later with some tech <unk> later though 
 *edit : <unk> front page on my first post 
 thanks tfts 
 *a few years ago i did some contract work for two different companies that were owned and run by the same group of people 
 for the most part they were separate legal <unk> but they shared some network resources and at one point some office space 
 each company had their own it staff though including developers help desk and admins 
 my buddy was the lead developer so he was in charge of a few interns 
 one of the interns proved to be completely useless within a couple weeks of <unk> showed up late left early took long <unk> did less work than anyone else etc 
 they let him go on a friday as was customary 
 monday rolls around and useless intern is <unk> down the hallway like nothing happened 
 my buddy <unk> him down and tells him dude i fired you 
 you ca n't be in the building who let you in '' 
 oh <unk> hired me back on because they needed help with this project .. the it manager storms off to talk to management 
 it turns out that the assistant to the <unk> saw the termination email go through hr and <unk> asking <unk> immediately <unk> him under the other company 
 they did n't know why he was fired and never asked 
 was he stealing from the company 
 did he assault someone 
 did the background check show he was a convicted <unk> 
 oh he seemed like a nice kid and we really needed help on this .. *facepalm* so they kept useless intern around for a few more weeks so he could prove he was useless again 
 luckily he was n't fired for anything horrible but in any other company it would have been considered a massive security <unk> was recently asked why my co-worker girlfriend and i have the same acer laptop so i 'll tell the tale 
 perhaps a year ago working at my telco ... & gt boss : hey bytewave there 's going to be a job opening in our department soon do you have time to handle grading the exams '' 
 pretty <unk> task always a ton of applicants and the 5 exams for technical support 's senior staff are hard so it 's a long string of failures usually before you get the guy but hey paid by the hour 
 plus i have nobody to blame given i designed some of the exams 
 & gt bytewave : sure 
 there 's an opening 
 they really finally opened new positions '' 
 & gt boss : alas not 
 thierry 's leaving for sales senior staff i 'll need to fill the slot 
 usual exams to be corrected in rank of seniority '' 
 i was slightly taken aback 
 few tech people much less senior staff are interested in anything that has to do with sales 
 we fight <unk> and nail to ensure that our frontline staff does n't have to sell stuff when troubleshooting 
 there 's admittedly a much more <unk> gender ratio over there but thierry was already married 
 he saw me wince 
 & gt boss : there was an argument 
 we do n't have much to reward you guys with beyond pay and the work contract basics here 
 over at sales they get <unk> <unk> all the time 
 thierry got mad that the top girl over at sss got a free car as a performance bonus last month while all i have are free pens 
 really wish i had the rewards budget to match that '' 
 ... it 's true 
 sss is seen as an awesome source of revenue by the telco while tsss gets scraps at best 
 we 've often been told you 're an expense not a revenue '' 
 & gt bytewave : i 'll grade 
 but the rewards budget will always be <unk> for tech support 
 just use another budget if you want to hand out candy '' 
 he was about to say something thought the better of it nodded and went back to his desk 
 he 's always had our interests at heart but is always careful not to say anything that could be incriminating - he has no union to back him as a manager 
 soon after at the next tsss monthly meeting ... & gt boss : so i know our security suite has always been <unk> but i 'm told they 're really trying hard to make the next <unk> outstanding 
 i know we 've heard that before but still 
 this time around i thought tsss ought to take a more direct hand in testing the beta 
 we have the usual external qa team on it too '' 
 since that falls well outside our typical job description and union job descriptions are fairly narrow people in the room were n't immediately <unk> a few puzzled eyebrows were exchanged 
 also we all hate that software previously featured here & gt boss : purely voluntary basis of course 
 i 've had these laptops <unk> for testing purposes 
 but you 'll have to install the security suite on it yourselves if you 're interested 
 you can take them home and back here as you like 
 if you take one and find any bugs you can file them the usual way '' 
 the department secretary brings in a pile of these acer laptops then another 
 i notice there 's literally one for every of us 
 & gt frank : wait 
 you know we ca n't do any work outside work hours without violating the work contract and we already have plenty of computers here to run tests on the clock for ... '' indeed we had already been testing the beta in our lab and on several workstations 
 & gt boss : oh i know the rules i 've been union too 
 never do any work outside work hours without authorized paid overtime 
 this is not an authorization to bill overtime that requires hr-logistics consent 
 anyhow these are for testing as per the <unk> budget for the security suite 
 they 've been added to the permanent testing devices account '' 
 and then it dawned on frank and any other who had not already read in-between the lines 
 i have two <unk> with full testing profiles in my condo i never paid a penny for because they 're <unk> devices 
 they never ever ask for these devices back once the tests are complete 
 it 's more trouble to track them back than to just forget about them 
 & gt frank : oh 
 well did it have to be acer laptops if you 're ... '' & gt boss : ahem 
 it 's what we could have in bulk at a reasonable cost 
 *for testing 
 * again purely voluntary basis take one if you 'd like 
 the acer <unk> has been removed 
 no worries if you do n't feel like it they 'll be put to good use elsewhere '' 
 everybody took one 
 boss never really expected us to even install the security suite at all 
 the whole point was to tap an unlimited budget to give us something <unk> to show appreciation because unlike other departments tech support almost never gets any money to do that outside the christmas budget 
 he 's really great making things a little better for our department in a company that 's usually truly <unk> when it comes to giving us anything that goes beyond the work contract 's requirements 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 him : alright since the monitor is giving you troubles let 's try turning it off and turning it back on again '' 
 user : i already did that '' 
 him : alright let 's just do it again just to be sure '' 
 user : i ca n't find the button 
 frustration crossed my cousins face as the progress bar slowly <unk> across his game console 
 & gt cuzdad : it’s so close to the <unk> though 
 i don’t know why it’s so slow 
 & gt me : its **router** 
 plus i think it’s an issue with the game service not your internet 
 cuzdad went back to the game console and continued to try to update the system 
 the fact is was working albeit slowly on <unk> day seemed like a miracle to me 
 & gt cuzdad : darn it our internet has been acting up a lot lately 
 help me move this thing closer to the <unk> 
 & gt me : **router** 
 i sighed as i helped <unk> the cords behind the television set 
 arguing was <unk> since he was family 
 & gt cuzdad : <unk> all tangled down behind the tv isn’t it 
 & gt me : mmm hmm 
 i pulled at the cords connected to the game console everywhere i looked things were wired incorrectly 
 <unk> with external sound systems that weren’t plugged in speakers plugged into inputs not <unk> 
 it was a mess 
 & gt cuzdad : you know i’ve always wondered how that happens 
 you put the cords in nicely but when you come back its all tangled and messed up 
 how you going with the <unk> 
 & gt me : i can’t get one cord right at the bottom 
 i tried reaching for the cord right at the back 
 it was too far 
 i decided to move the entertainment cupboard forward so i could get properly behind it 
 i started to slide the heavy unit forward 
 & gt cuzdad : woah what are you doing 
 & gt me : i can’t get my hand in far enough to get the power cable so if we just slid everything <unk> & gt cuzdad : woah no 
 thats where dust lives 
 i don’t want that stuff all over the house 
 i sighed again at my cousin who was looking at me expectantly 
 i just waited for his suggestion knowing i couldn’t get back to the family gathering outside before all his ideas were attempted 
 & gt cuzdad : i got it 
 my cousin went over to my spot and gave a swift pull at the cord 
 he managed to pull it out but partially split the <unk> <unk> where the wire goes into the plug 
 & gt cuzdad : f # $ @ 
 he quickly gathered up the console and moved it across the room plugging it in right next to the router 
 next he couldn’t find the av cords to stretch across the entire room 
 eventually producing an entire basket of tangled cords in which he insisted a long cable was buried in 
 & gt cuzdad : i’m not good with <unk> you know… as we started <unk> the mass of cords in the basket i could hear the rest of my extended family having fun at the dining table 
 i internally berated myself for answering <unk> when my cousin asked if i’d ever owned a game console 
 & gt cuzdad : so how is it that everything always gets tangled 
 it’s like a <unk> little <unk> you know 
 my cousin seemed to answer that question himself moments later when we’d finally gotten out the cord we wanted he stuffed every cord back into the basket we’d just separated out 
 & gt me : it’s a mystery 
 & gt cuzdad : lets see if this works 
 naturally the service was still horribly slow 
 this time however my cousin was off on another rant 
 & gt cuzdad : three bars 
 see that 
 three bars of reception and it 's practically sitting on top of the <unk> 
 & gt me : **router** 
 and if you’re so worried about reception why not just plug it in 
 cuzdad went on a tirade about how that wasn’t even an option and how my nephew should be able to play with his christmas presents <unk> christmas 
 eventually he calmed down and decided plugging it in could work albeit temporarily 
 the download did not speed up 
 after eventually giving up we made it too the dining table 
 my dear cousin let it be known to all the younger generation that even <unk> could not get the beloved new game to work 
 he also let slip that <unk> partially broke the power cord which managed to badly upset my nephew 
 i shook my head in disgust at the whole event 
 so a new rule for techies everywhere : <unk> christmas you know nothing about technology you’ve hit your head and forgotten everything for the day 
 ** just another day at my telco when we all get an email from systems about a new policy : road techs will now install new software from <unk> on all the computers of new internet users to <unk> quality of service and <unk> inform end users if they have any issues with their drivers or anything that may impact service - thus reducing call flow 
 & gt amelia : guys check your mail ... or your spam folder for those filtering systems 
 we 're into spyware now '' 
 and she was spot on as usual 
 it 's exactly what it was 
 that thing called home with a ton of data that - while useful - was <unk> scary 
 and somehow senior staff only learned about it when it was authorized to be deployed in the field 
 what could possibly go wrong 
 & gt bytewave : nevermind the fact we should have known about this months ago does anyone have a copy of this thing 
 boss '' 
 & gt boss : just learning about it too ... i 'll get you one right away 
 get out of the lines i need you to test this thing and make sure the only problems with it are legal 's ... '' soon after i get a copy of the software and after some basic tests ... '' & gt bytewave : boss there 's a problem 
 or several if you happen to care about osx '' 
 & gt boss : color me surprised 
 good news bad news ... or just bad news '' 
 & gt bytewave : well the good news is that all 15 to 20 % of our customers who are running the <unk> version of microsoft 's net <unk> will be able to be spied on as intended 
 those who are n't or are running <unk> however will get *this* <unk> <unk> error 
 as for the lucky <unk> using osx ... well these guys do n't get blue screens but any attempts to install our new <unk> ... software on macs appear to cause immediate kernel panic - or a sad face if you 're running really old versions 
 do you need me to test this this on *nix or have we already established this is amateur hour on top of the legal issues '' 
 whenever i see my boss face <unk> this badly it 's a mixed feeling 
 on one hand something has gone terribly wrong 
 on the other i know it 's not my problem anymore and it 's going to get fixed promptly 
 & gt bytewave : so you need me to speak to systems about this or you 'll ... '' he sighs deeply but keeps his usual professional cool 
 & gt boss : i 'm on it 
 this will be delayed until issues are solved 
 good work '' 
 that was the last we heard about it for awhile 
 said spyware was ultimately never deployed in the field 
 we long had other tools to monitor quality of service and driver issues either way - this smacked of a wide tie trying to come up with a quick way to get some credit for <unk> support calls without ever asking tech support how they ought to do such a thing 
 in short business as usual 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 when i was a kid both my cousin and i used to watch a bunch of captain tsubasa <unk> or <unk> e <unk> for us guys who only got italian tv 
 so my cousin gets captain tsubasa ii on the <unk> and he lends me captain tsubasa i and i play the shit out of that game 
 it was in japanese and i did n't know what to do but fuck it you know 
 it 's a football game i 'm sorry ... soccer ... not that difficult to understand what 's happening 
 so after a month or so i give him back the game he lent me and we go our separate ways 
 not so fast son 
 later in the day his mum calls my mum and as told by my mum this conversation happens : & gt aunt <unk> : listen when my son lends you games your son needs to take care of them 
 this is unbelievable 
 & gt mum : what happened 
 & gt aunt : you know what happened 
 you dropped my son 's <unk> cartridge in the fucking water 
 & gt mum : is it not working 
 <unk> this point i 'm seeing my mum eyeing me ready to kick my <unk> & gt aunt : no it 's working 
 & gt mum : then what gave you the impression that we dropped it in water 
 & gt aunt : the players are all smaller 
 like they shrunk 
 & gt mum : <unk> <unk> later we learned that the second release of the game the players looked bigger on the screen than in the first game 
 my cousin having played the second game for a month forgot how the players used to look in the first game told his mum and her first thought was she must have put the game in the water because the players shrunk down a size or two '' 
 tl dr : my mum does tech <unk> work as a consultant doing all sorts of sysadmin work and general tech support for various companies who hire my employer 's services like an <unk> one might say 
 one of our customers has a rather complex system which is maintained by another external party and in the time where this story takes place this other company was doing a substantial upgrade to this system 
 part of the upgrade was to implement an sftp connection which allowed the customer to utilize the cloud '' instead of storing everything locally 
 however the other party kept running in to problems 
 it 's not working '' they said please open port 22 in the firewalls between $ <unk> and $ <unk> '' 
 we knew that the port was not blocked but we did them the favour of at least looking in to it and verifying that the port was indeed open as requested 
 then we heard nothing for two months until they suddenly sent in a new ticket with the same request please open port 22 '' 
 this ... interesting email exchange then occurred between me and their lead tech though abbreviated obviously : **me : ** we have verified that the connection worked using both $ <unk> and $ <unk> the port is n't blocked '' 
 **him : ** it is too 
 our program is n't working '' 
 **me : ** you have specified port 22 right 
 i mean so that it does n't default to using regular ftp on port 21 '' 
 **him : ** yes of course '' 
 **me : ** what kind of program is this really '' 
 **him : ** it 's a script you can see it if you go to $ <unk> '' 
 **me : ** ok well i just looked at the script and i can see you are using $ <unk> but you are not declaring the port when calling the command so it 's clearly using port 21 which is the default 
 here is what you need to change it to : $ <unk> 
 please correct it and get back to us if it 's still not working '' 
 nothing was heard for a while after that 
 i had really gone beyond my responsibilities by troubleshooting their code - which i had never even seen before - and giving them a solution and i was <unk> by their incompetence 
 i thought for sure that they would manage to fix it now 
 but ... then they came back : **him : ** we changed the port and it 's still not working '' 
 **me : ** no you did n't change the port 
 i looked at the script just now and you have n't changed anything 
 i have now changed it for you 
 please see if it works '' 
 after this we mysteriously enough never heard from them again 
 who could have guessed 
 needless to say we reported their incompetence to our customer who had to pay the hourly rates of both me and the other tech probably <unk> to <unk> hours of consulting for something that was n't actually an issue in any <unk> <unk> tales i 'm not kind towards the telco i work for even <unk> some of our <unk> laundry at times 
 they earned my <unk> through nonsense ranging from atrocious <unk> policies to <unk> clogging courts to <unk> with their own employees orders recently came from on up that every employee - be they sorting mail or sitting on the board - would have a <unk> long 'information security class 
 in language drawn by legal everybody was to be taught via powerpoint and videos that opening email attachments not approved by their boss is worse than being <unk> 
 most importantly they focused on the notion that <unk> revealing the horrible <unk> of the corporation to the public would be a crime against humanity 
 when i heard about this i chuckled 
 even though i 'm always careful not to reveal where i work - i know they 'd pay a bounty for bytewave 's '' <unk> 
 i simply posted too many tales about what 's wrong here - placing me squarely on the notoriously incompetent <unk> inquisition radar 
 i was about to take my seat and silently savor the irony 
 but the <unk> previously featured for his keyboard issues supposed to give this mandatory class '' to my team tsss got emergency texts 
 fifteen of us working escalation tech support were now sitting in there but his blackberry said he was needed 15 floors up 15 minutes ago 
 and so he walked up to me with a binder a <unk> and the projector 's remote 
 the irony that i was assigned to teach my colleagues about the benefits of information security despite being unofficially in charge of our shadow it had a few of my colleagues giggling five seconds after he 'd left the room 
 that 's often all you can expect when it comes to teaching classes here 
 it 's a good day when i do n't need to make up material on the spot 
 but teaching tech senior staff is n't exactly like teaching new hires 
 nobody sitting in those chairs needed to hear any of this 
 i still looked at the binder for a minute 
 as expected it was all <unk> inane and worthless nonsense someone with a very wide tie decided would cover their ass appropriately if a few thousand employees were forced to hear it 
 & gt bytewave : alright folks this is a mandatory 3 hour class on information security ... do n't use weak passwords 
 even though it really does n't matter here 
 do n't tell frontline employees things they should n't know 
 do n't give instructions on recorded phone lines that directly challenge corporate policies 
 and do n't be a fucking idiot in general 
 anyone wants to know more than that the class pdf and powerpoint will be on our drive 
 floor open to questions '' 
 & gt frank : heh thanks for <unk> us 
 i guess we just hang in here for the next 2 hours and <unk> minutes '' 
 & gt stephan : would beat taking escalation calls from subcontractors '' 
 & gt bytewave : well the <unk> did n't even file this class on formal record 
 let 's call it an extended break '' 
 so we all went downstairs and walked to the bar across the street 
 had a couple <unk> generally chatting about how insane and <unk> the corporation 's stance on information security is 
 and other stuff 
 on one hand they 're willing to spend tons to teach theory to employees - but will never spend a penny to make the tools we use remotely secure 
 even though union staff repeatedly pointed out that some practices have been out of league with industry standards for well over a decade they 'd rather teach everyone to keep quiet than fix the underlying issues 
 back at my old workplace this would have largely qualified as a <unk> lunch even though all we ate was bar snacks 
 <unk> hours later we went back up the tower 
 i was expecting having to say i took the team <unk> and <unk> a reason why 
 & gt low-level manager : you guys done already 
 class ended up taking closer to four or five hours for most of the staff '' 
 & gt bytewave : what can i say 
 tech support 's senior staff <unk> stuff quicker than most '' 
 all of bytewave 's tales on tfts 
 tl dr : i provide the arcane secrets to efficiency 
 there were a few secretaries working in my office today no hot ones unfortunately we recently got a lot of wide screen monitors installed which is nice 
 one of the secretaries said that she 'd have to get used to it but she liked it 
 to which i made an idle comment : yeah it 's great 
 that way you can have two windows open at the same time '' 
 immediately they all wanted to know how to do that 
 such <unk> 
 so i showed them how to use the windows key and arrow keys to place windows on the left and right 
 and i was <unk> as some kind of priest or <unk> 
 the awe the <unk> 
 it was ... amazing ... **edit : ** i wish i had a way to show this trick to everyone in our company 
 it 's so useful 
 but i can barely get them to read the manual for the business critical software we use 
 <unk> : ** a lot of people are pointing out that they did n't know the hotkeys either 
 well happy to have been of help 
 more windows hotkeys can be found here <unk> : ** holy crap 
 gold 
 thanks so much 
 or how to ruin an expensive computer 
 yesterday we got a client that ask us why his pc would smell burnt what he brought to us made me cry 
 he brought us it guy had a quadro yes an <unk> quadro a nice asus motherboard and some <unk> disc trays plus a dedicated sound card 
 then once we were done admiring his build we directed our eyes to the burnt cables the power supply had burnt marks on the exhaust fan and on the cable plugs 
 & gt $ me : <unk> ohh no no no ... & gt $ client : what 's wrong with my pc 
 can you fix it 
 we quickly <unk> everything sorting the components by order the mobo power plugs were certainly burnt and that quadro the quadro did n't make it ... who was the culprit 
 the $ 25 psu all high quality components and he shoved a chinese brand psu ... his mobo sound card and gpu did n't make it but the rest of the components managed to make it out alive by some miracle 
 we sold him a quality psu and mobo while he <unk> another gpu for cad stuff so i got a bit of commission for the sale enough to buy me extra food 
 but still why do people spend $ $ $ in everything but the psu ... 
 tl dr : do n't buy a cheap <unk> everyone lurker here 
 this story happened a few years back when i was still in school and everyone had to do an internship for two weeks 
 being of highest technical expertise in comparison to the guy sitting next to you in your <unk> class i naturally applied for a job in the it field 
 the next town over had a nice computer <unk> and so i applied 
 knowing the manager helped but being the only <unk> did its part too 
 so the very first day i start there under the <unk> of the $ sysadmin i am being introduced to the systems 
 while he explains my main task will be to take care of the <unk> as some tend to be a little fragile and require frequent maintenance or reboots $ secretary comes in and just interrupts $ sysadmin with following words : the payment server is down 
 since friday '' 
 today 's monday 
 he was on vacation for a week 
 with an absolute pokerface and a blank stare $ sysadmin quickly shows me one exhibit that 's been acting up lately 
 10 minutes and an easy fix later i get back into the basement walk through the server cabinets up to the very front cabinet where 3 people and $ sysadmin are standing 
 they all look at the servers and do n't say a word 
 problem is : one and only one server has no power 
 it 's the server which manages the payment of the employees power company isp and more 
 tracking back the power cable resulted in an interesting finding : it seems as if it was plugged into the psu 
 but someone actually plugged it into an extension cable 
 tracing back that extension cable required us to open the rack from behind only to find that the cable was laying on the ground next to a normal wall outlet 
 $ sysadmin admins face does n't move a bit 
 he <unk> plugs everything back in and checks if the server is doing fine 
 it seems so except suddenly the firmware is upgraded 
 his anger is not to be seen from his body language but only from his empty <unk> stare 
 calmly walking through the office asking every single person if they did something with the server he stumbled upon $ software_engineer 
 $ sysadmin : *hey $ se did you do something on the payment server while i was away 
 * $ software_engineer : <unk> yes i upgraded the firmware for you because i hated that little popup no biggie 
 * $ sysa in the calmest and yet most <unk> voice i ever heard : *and you have n't noticed that the server is down since friday 
 * $ se : * ... * $ sysa : <unk> me ask you a question : do you know what a plug is 
 and where it belongs 
 * $ se : * ... yes ... i put it into an outlet 
 * $ sysa : *and may i ask why you plugged it into an <unk> extension cord 
 * $ se : *well i needed to reboot the server so i unplugged it as i ca n't do that via <unk> 
 and then i needed to charge my laptop and that just plugging the server in somewhere else seemed easier instead of my laptop being far away from the server 
 * $ sysa : *and why is the extension cord not plugged in 
 * $ se : *well ... i needed to reboot it a second time but i was called away and ... i forgot ... * $ sysa : * $ <unk> would you mind just grabbing a fresh drink for us from the cafeteria 
 * slowly i walked away only to hear $ sysa lose his pokerface 
 $ manager ran into the room and tried to calm $ sysa down but there was no holding him back 
 slowly and scared i got 2 <unk> and on my <unk> back $ sysa comes up to me looking more refreshed than he did after his vacation 
 happy and smiling he grabbed his drink and got to work completely undo $ se 's mess 
 $ se was only seen outside smoking one cigarette after another that day 
 this is my first post to tfts and reddit in general the following happened about a year ago when i as a student was called by a friend to <unk> the internet at his dorm 
 *note that this is a private owned ~ 12 room building* so i put some stuff into my <unk> laptop extra <unk> some cables and <unk> to my friends place 
 & gt friend : the internet kind of works but it is extremely slow 
 so i tried some stuff a couple of pings and noted the following : $ ping 192.168.1.1 ping 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.1 <unk> <unk> bytes of data 
 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1 : <unk> <unk> <unk> ms i try to log in to the management page but get connection refused clearly this router is n't listening on port 80 
 & gt me : your router seems to be broken where is it 
 & gt friend : in the network closet that hangs on the wall in the hall & gt *me looks to network closet hanging <unk> high on a <unk> & gt me : and you do n't happen to have the key for it 
 & gt friend : no but the landlord will be here on friday can you come by then 
 & gt me : <unk> 
 so that friday i am back landlord gives me the key and ladder and i climb up there the closet contains : * the cable modem * a large 24 port <unk> <unk> switch * this a <unk> compaq desktop note that that pic is n't mine i do n't think i took any pictures at least i ca n't find any * lots of dust <unk> & gt me : is that your router 
 & gt landlord : it could be 
 it has been there since i bought this building 5 years ago 
 & gt friend : could that be the issue 
 & gt me : <unk> hand behind the fan to check the temp it is quiet <unk> well if it is n't now it sure is going to be in the near future 
 i pull out the compaq wire it up to a monitor and it boots some ancient <unk> version with a <unk> kernel 
 i open it up and it 's full of dust <unk> 
 & gt me genuinely surprised : i 'm surprised this thing still runs 
 & gt landlord : well if i have to get the isp technician come over to fix stuff it 's going to cost me <unk> just in labour 
 <unk> wallet and pulls out 2 <unk> here do you think you can fix it for €100 
 & gt me : well yes that should work 
 so i walk to the nearest it store grab a cheap <unk> <unk> router for €30 
 put the router in-between the modem and the switch everything works 
 set up wifi note that there was no wifi before just wired test wireless reception on the top floor just for fun works <unk> 
 put the remaining <unk> in my wallet 
 a couple of months ago that friend let me know that the landlord had increased the rent because now there was wifi 
 lucky enough my friend had graduated so he does n't have to renew his contract 
 ps : i took the <unk> to a friend and now it is happy in his collection of ancient machines mainly servers 
 tldr : internet slow = & gt broken router = & gt router is an ancient compaq desktop full of dust = & gt got €100 to replace it with a new €30 router = & gt rent increased because wifi 
 edit : <unk> 6 years ago or so i was looking to get out of the job i was in 
 just a <unk> move as a network administrator but i thought i 'd find someplace with an actual it budget even a small one 
 after hitting the internet really hard i found a somewhat local school district was interviewing for a network assistant 
 problem number 1 was that even though i was on the border of this school district the main building i would work from was on the far edge of the next county 
 i thought well for the right <unk> i could live with it so i went into the interview 
 i go in and meet the man who would be my boss if i got the job 
 while being completely socially inept and awkward as hell he managed to tell me that the person i 'd be replacing was only part time the new job would be full time but the outgoing guy did n't like the full time pay 
 ok so that 's red flag # 2. deeper into the interview the guy started asking me really open ended vague questions 
 after about 15 minutes of back and forth with this guy about my technical skills and him repeating : & gt it 's really important to take time every day to learn he asks me what i 'm interested in 
 my natural response was to ask if he means professional or personally 
 i 've had <unk> ask either or both to get a feel for who i really am so it was n't odd 
 his response was one i never heard before : & gt i do n't give a shit about what you 're interested in personally 
 i do n't want to know you i just need to know if you 'll work here 
 and with that i got up and told him i most certainly would n't work there and told him he wasted his time and <unk> had a user try plugging the power cable into a usb slot and call me down because it would n't fit 
 literally a circle connector into a square port 
 goodbye tfts 
 it 's been a pleasure 
 i 'm going living a <unk> <unk> worked on a customer site once 
 management decisions were ... interesting 
 the one which stood out was the one i got told by the technical lead of internal it 
 the big boss came up to him one day and the following conversation ensued : i hear that smtp is not a 100 % guaranteed delivery protocol '' 
 that 's true 
 there could be failures on the machines in between our email server and the <unk> ... '' we need a 100 % reliable protocol 
 our emails are too important to risk them going <unk> '' 
 um 
 smtp is the global standard for sending emails 
 everyone uses it 
 we have to use it if we want to send emails at all '' 
 i heard there 's a 100 % reliable <unk> protocol '' 
 er ... well there might be some sort of custom protocol which will keep trying until confirmation is received yeah '' 
 good 
 find it and install it on our email servers 
 i want to make sure that all our emails get delivered '' 
 but nobody else uses ... '' do n't argue 
 just do it '' 
 the technical lead paused in his tale <unk> the sheer distance that now existed between my <unk> and the rest of my face 
 so.. '' i asked <unk> ... what did you do '' 
 oh what we always do 
 i told <unk> to go into the server room for a day and surf the web 
 when he came out i told the boss we 'd done what he asked 
 he went away quite happy 
 i 'll never hear about it again 
 previous it rule three : descriptions are scary and hard just fix it 
 & gt long ago the motor car was invented it was a complicated piece of machinery 
 it was so complicated that the average layperson could not immediately understand precisely what every part did 
 then we invented the computer it was even more complicated 
 the layperson had no chance to understanding what was going on this confusion led to the <unk> of it 
 & gt much like our mechanical <unk> we get users who do not understand even the basics of computer operation and maintenance 
 fortunately for our car fixing cousins faults in <unk> are usually <unk> obvious or can be described in terms like “a <unk> 
 unfortunately for us working in it this basic descriptive fault <unk> becomes suddenly lost when thinking about computers 
 this lack of descriptive prowess usually leads to the following situations : 1. you’re looking down at a computer for the fifth time the note taped to the screen just says “still broken please <unk> 
 as you boot up the device and watch it perform <unk> you scratch your head and wonder what exactly is broken 
 a call to the department leads to a chain people claiming not to know the specifics of the fault leaving you with a headache and a seemingly working computer 
 you’ll box it up and send it back to that department with a note <unk> *” 
 2. a user calls down to it naturally the call lands at your desk 
 the screeching voice down the line tells you in panicked tones that they can not login 
 your insistence that they read out the specific error message is met with confusion followed swiftly by anger at your refusal to <unk> let them get on with their work.” 
 naturally this caller requests an escalation to the manager 
 as you fetch your manager he asks you what’s wrong you’ll shrug and explain your user can not login 
 he’ll ask why and you’ll shrug again 
 the look of exasperation that crosses your managers face will hurt you come bonus time 
 3. <unk> will be discovered before a fault is successfully diagnosed by a user 
 i can say this with <unk> because if a user can diagnose the fault they can fix the fault 
 however occasionally users with the ability to <unk> a diagnostic conversation will <unk> this will lead to the fault being swiftly dealt with 
 unfortunately these users are usually in charge of the least critical systems 
 the <unk> business critical system will always be left with a user too impatient to diagnose they just want <unk> 
 4. sometimes a large error or fault will be discovered by a department but due to shame or … it’s swept under the rug 
 these faults usually build up or are badly dealt with by the offending department until one weekend in the early hours of the morning the entire service <unk> 
 a later investigation will reveal a tiny easily fixable fault ended up costing the company millions 
 hopefully the above examples are few and far between 
 regardless here are a few ways to tackle the problem 
 1. implement a ticket system ensure that the description of the problem box has a one word minimum 
 tickets help work out who exactly is sending things down to the department regardless of their problem descriptive abilities 
 — unfortunately a ticket system can also lead to people just leaving equipment to rot some departments are too lazy for tickets and the casual employee that would send things down is now too <unk> by the 10 forms they have to fill out on there one day in the office a week 
 2. refuse to fix anything without a description of exactly what is wrong 
 <unk> manager will love you 
 3. enforce <unk> system were the machines with descriptive faults will be fixed more <unk> then the <unk> masses 
 <unk> that could actually work 
 if you’re lucky you’ll avoid the lack of descriptions with good company culture 
 don’t get <unk> though it only takes a single company executive to have a <unk> that you need to <unk> and you’ve landed in a minefield with no map out 
 good luck 
 ***** <unk> & gt grumblecake : hey so i need this fixed 
 grumblecake <unk> a charred laptop down on the table 
 it looks like it’s been in a war zone 
 & gt me : er… yep… i reached out and have it a <unk> with my pen a charred piece of plastic fell off the side 
 & gt me : it’s ruined 
 burnt to a <unk> 
 <unk> 
 & gt grumblecake : oh i knew that 
 i just need another one 
 a small sigh of relief escaped my lips 
 luckily grumble cake wasn’t insane 
 i smiled and tried to work out the model from its charred remains 
 & gt me : yeah okay i think its a @ $ % @ $ 
 we don’t have any on hand but we’ll order one in 
 & gt grumblecake : cool cool 
 ummm so when will it be here 
 & gt me : monday i think 
 & gt grumblecake : excellent ill come pick it up tuesday 
 after you’ve installed all the programs 
 grumblecake had turned and started walking towards the door 
 & gt me : wait what … what programs 
 & gt grumblecake : just the same ones that were on that 
 grumblecake didn’t turn he just pointed to the black mess of plastic still lying on the table 
 & gt me : what programs 
 which programs 
 it was too late 
 he was already gone 
 i <unk> the burn <unk> off the table and went to call the number on the contact form 
 it was blank 
 naturally 
 this is a quick tale of tech support 
 a customer called in claiming that there were viruses on her computer 
 this is the phone conversation ending in my complete loss of faith in humanity 
 customer : i 'm not sure what happened my computer says there are 6000 viruses i get lots of popups it locks up all the time 
 me : alright ma'am 
 can you describe to me what you were working on before all of this started 
 customer : i was checking my email and there was a message from <unk> morgan chase bank 
 it said my bank account was put on hold 
 it told me to click on a link in order to reactivate my account 
 me : do you have a <unk> morgan chase bank account 
 customer : no 
 *ten seconds of dead air while i stare blankly into my computer screen contemplating human <unk> what 's up tfts 
 i 'm finishing up a long saturday shift and figured i would do a little venting about the garbage i deal with when i 'm at home 
 a little backstory quick : i work for <unk> and yes you 've heard of them 
 i mainly cover business accounts which means getting yelled at for nine hours a day while scripting modems and fixing issues 
 before working in tech support i was a field technician for this company so i knew both the hardware and <unk> side of the systems which helps <unk> in this position 
 when i go home lately i have made it a habit of not answering my phone because usually it 's acquaintances that i have n't talked to in awhile wanting me to help them out 
 the latest one pushed me to now no longer answering my phone 
 this <unk> '' called me as in someone i have n't talked to in over a year at almost <unk> a couple of months ago when it was still <unk> 
 we 'll call him rob '' for the story 's sake 
 rob had a big <unk> and was born with a silver <unk> in his mouth 
 i also <unk> heads with him on a lot of things because he just loved to argue 
 he was a very negative person that i really did n't want to talk to anyways so there was nothing of real value lost when he stopped hanging out with our mutual friends 
 *rob : hey <unk> what 's going on 
 * **gnpunk : oh hey rob 
 been awhile 
 ** *rob : yeah sorry to bother you 
 you got a few minutes 
 * & gt in the middle of adding on ridiculous hours to my skyrim profile ... **gnpunk : a little yeah 
 what 's up 
 ** *rob : oh i 'm having issues with my internet 
 thought you could help out 
 * & gt really 
 you have n't called me in like two years and you want me to help 
 **gnpunk : i 'm not working right now 
 call residential support 
 ** *rob : the queue is like 90 minutes 
 * **gnpunk : i know 
 i ca n't do anything about it 
 i 'll at least hear out the problem 
 ** *rob : well i ca n't get online 
 * & gt of course you ca n't ... **gnpunk : did you reboot the modem and router 
 ** *rob : yeah nothing 
 * **gnpunk : i ca n't access anything from home 
 you 'll have to call the hotline 
 ** *rob : dude it will be four days before a tech comes out 
 can you just come out 
 * & gt ... .this has to be a joke 
 i live in the <unk> of a city 
 he does as well but he 's on the opposite side 
 even driving through the city it 's a minimum half an hour <unk> 
 at 10:00 pm after a long day of dealing with this no chance unless he pays me 
 **gnpunk : alright but you 're going to pay me for my time 
 ** *rob : what 
 you love dealing with this stuff 
 why ca n't you just come out 
 * **gnpunk : i love building computers 
 i do not love fixing broken modems 
 i do that because it pays the bills 
 ** *rob : well ... i 'll throw you ten bucks for gas 
 * & gt <unk> **gnpunk : no 
 you 're asking me to drive late at night in the winter to do something i may not even be able to fix 
 ** *rob : well just drive your work van over 
 * he had <unk> me on facebook and thought i did n't notice so he obviously did n't see that i had switched jobs 
 i really did n't care that he <unk> me either since he never made an effort to do anything and always wanted people to drive to him 
 **gnpunk : i do n't work in the field anymore 
 i could go and get my buddy 's tools but seriously you 're paying me if i 'm going out in this weather 
 emergency rate would be $ 75 an hour 
 ** *rob : whatever man i figured you would help a friend out 
 * **gnpunk : i would help a friend out 
 ** *rob : fuck you 
 * tl dr : do n't call me after working hours 
 i 'm off i 'm at home and i 'm probably drinking 
 : edit # 1 : fixed some formatting issues 
 *edit # 2 : woo 
 quote of the day on tfts from my story 
 thanks for the upvotes everyone 
 *we spent ages on the phone trying to figure out the problem 
 the user 's cd played fine in her car but it no longer fit '' into her cd drive 
 she held the phone to the cd drive - the tray sounded like it was opening and closing smoothly there were no funny noises nothing stuck inside the drive 
 we were absolutely baffled but she 's one of the sweetest users we 've ever had so we stuck with it 
 we wanted to get it working for her 
 she said the cd simply no longer fit '' 
 finally we broke down and had her send us a picture 
 she had recently moved offices and whoever set up her computer had put it upside down 
 she 'd failed to notice that her power button and cd tray were now on the bottom of the computer instead of the top or had at least failed to think it strange 
 back in the day <unk> was just a young <unk> doing web development at a small design shop 
 small means very small : by web development '' i mean design development qa and <unk> whatever that means when there 's just you '' 
 my boss was the owner of the company 
 we were working with a local event <unk> who needed a website and a way to sell tickets for their show 
 rather than using an external service like <unk> or similar we went the <unk> route with a <unk> form <unk> in the website 
 one day our client called boss 
 a website user had called client because he was stuck 
 client and boss discussed the problem boss eventually gave up and said to have the user call us and <unk> would help him out 
 client gave user our phone number and boss tells us that a website user will be calling and to be nice to him and help him out 
 user calls and the secretary passes the call to me 
 this situation is unusual but not out of the question client was not particularly tech savvy so it 's quite possible that she 'd been stumped by something and if there really was a <unk> error in the website then i would need to fix it 
 & gt **me** : hello this is $ me how can i help you 
 & gt **user** : hi yeah i ca n't get the website to load right 
 i ca n't buy tickets 
 & gt **me** : okay can you load other websites 
 & gt **user** : yes my internet is fine i just ca n't buy tickets 
 i start asking debugging questions : what kind of device are you using '' 
 what browser and version 
 here 's how you find out what version of ie you are using '' 
 etc 
 after a few minutes of this : & gt **me** : okay describe to me exactly what you 're seeing when you load $ client 's site 
 *i expect a description of a loading icon and maybe a time out error or popup from the <unk> & gt **user** : well there 's the regular website and * { title of the ticket form page } * and then there 's this green loading bar 
 and the green bar wo n't move 
 one time i left it there for 45 minutes and nothing happened 
 it clicks inside my head 
 i attempt to <unk> a <unk> probably not successfully 
 & gt **me** : oh 
 i know what the problem is 
 so that 's not a loading bar - it *is* a progress bar but it just shows you how many pages there are left in this form 
 if you click the next '' button you 'll see that it says 2 of 7 pages '' instead of 1 of 7 '' like it says right now 
 & gt **user** : <unk> <unk> time posting long time reader 
 i am the neighborhood tech guy 
 everyone calls me most the time it is fine and dandy and other times it can be a bit more challenging 
 this is where we meet bob 
 bob is a college student of one of the parents in the neighborhood 
 the parents give me a call and ask if i can call and help him 
 i get his number and give him a call as i 'm driving down the road to go <unk> 
 & gt me : whats the problem bob 
 & gt b : my internet does n't work and my roommate said there is something wrong 
 i have been getting a lot of pop-ups and virus 's 
 & gt me : ok go ahead and download and run malware bytes and call me back 
 & gt ... a few hours pass ... & gt b : ok i did that and removed everything like you told me to but now my internet does n't work 
 & gt me : ok lets check your proxy ... yup you had some proxy spyware 
 got him up and running 
 turns out he was trying to install a video player '' and it was a fake app 
 5 months go by & gt hey <unk> its bob 
 i need help call me at <unk> 
 & gt me : i call the number 
 his phone does not accept calls 
 heh 
 so i call his parents house and he happens to be there 
 & gt b : hey 
 i have lots of virus and chrome wo n't work and it does weird things 
 & gt me : ok bring it over 
 this kid has soooo much spyware and garbage on his machine 
 i spend two hours with him removing app after app after app 
 i give him the standard <unk> of if you do n't know what it is do n't download and install it '' over and over to hopefully <unk> it in his head 
 i had to wrap up early to head to work but there was still one app that would not flush 
 & gt b : oh 
 its ok i 'll just live with this one it will be ok 
 & gt nope 
 you will be back tomorrow for me to finish 
 & gt b : i uh ok ... he comes back the next day and we get it sorted out 
 the poor kid asks how much i charge 
 *sigh* i really hate doing free work as it means more free work later down the road 
 he pulls out a whole $ 7 from his wallet 
 *sigh* i ca n't take $ 7 from a poor college kid 
 i refuse 
 i did tell him if it had been summer he could have pulled <unk> for me but alas it is winter 
 i send him on his way 
 ... 2 weeks later ... <unk> <unk> it is bob 's father at the door asking for me 
 oh fun '' i think more support to be had 
 nope 
 the father came by to thank me for helping his son out 
 tells me how much he <unk> it 
 hands me two tickets 
 i look at them <unk> row center court tickets to an <unk> <unk> game 
 : o the ceo of his company gave them to him and he passed them on to me 
 holy 
 crap 
 he runs off before i could thank him enough 
 i 'm excited and thrilled 
 my <unk> has come 
 : d tldr : help college kid out multiple times payed with a pair of $ 275 <unk> <unk> afternoon 
 emergency heads of department meetings are worse then normal ones 
 they are like a surprise attack to destroy the day 
 the secretary walks in and asks everyone if they want <unk> 
 & gt me : coffee please 
 & gt sec : the machine is still broken 
 i’ll see what i can do 
 & gt me : if its instant don’t bother 
 the vp walked into the room he was looking proud 
 probably tied his own <unk> today 
 & gt vp : we’ve got a problem 
 a communication problem 
 a coffee arrived in front of me 
 i thanked the secretary 
 i took a sip 
 it was instant 
 i cursed the secretary 
 as i dreamt about the special layer of hell reserved for people like her the vp continued 
 & gt vp : recently a junior technician took home a switch without informing anyone 
 this kind of miscommunication will now be a thing of the past 
 the vp paused for greater effect 
 i sat bored 
 & gt headhr : how 
 & gt vp : we’re getting company mobiles 
 we’ll be able to communicate more efficiently when at work 
 some heads looked very excited the thought of a company mobile would make the gossip <unk> go into overdrive 
 fantastic 
 & gt vp : the it department will handle the phone roll out and support 
 i looked down at the instant 
 coffee told me i should be paying attention 
 & gt me : what 
 & gt vp : the roll out will come from your department since you’re all professionals in the it field you’d be the best to handle it 
 & gt me : we can’t afford phones 
 the it budget is stretched 
 remember i’m currently in an audit 
 sipping at my coffee the vp looked pleased 
 not a good sign 
 & gt vp : don’t worry airz 
 the phones won’t come out of your budget 
 in fact i’ve already ordered them all you’ve got to do is hand them out 
 & gt me : couldn’t you 
 & gt vp : hahaha giving out free phones your <unk> will <unk> 
 the vp gave me a smile 
 i wanted to turn it upside down preferably from the neck 
 next older tuesday <unk> working nights is strange the office is <unk> familiar but the staff are all completely different 
 eveninglady stood at the door to my office a look of disappointment <unk> evenly across her face 
 & gt eveninglady : here again airz 
 & gt me : i was thinking of making it permanent 
 i flashed eveninglady a jovial smile 
 & gt eveninglady : you know i heard whispers that one of the morning staff and you get along <unk> 
 the implication hung in the air my mind went into shock 
 & gt me : what 
 & gt eveninglady : oh you know the one ... if you work nights all the time you’ll never get to spend time with her ... & gt me : nice try 
 eveninglady hung her head and started shaking it the phone next to me started to ring 
 as i picked it up a growling voice shouted down the phone 
 & gt growl : the printer 
 is broken 
 & gt me : ahh to whom am i speaking 
 & gt growl : you’re it right 
 & gt me : i am 
 eveninglady started <unk> something to me 
 her arms <unk> about in a mad panic something about hanging up 
 & gt growl : why is it then that you don’t know about basic technology 
 & gt me : sorry what 
 & gt growl : caller id 
 you know that thing that tells you who is calling 
 god where do we find these technology <unk> 
 ** & gt me : my phone doesn’t have a screen 
 growl had already <unk> hung up 
 i looked up to see eveninglady continuing to signal at me 
 it was a rather amusing performance and i was tempted to let her continue 
 & gt me : he hung up 
 what were you trying to signal 
 & gt eveninglady : thats growl 
 & gt me : sorry who 
 & gt eveninglady : growl 
 he’s the most unpleasant person at the company 
 eveninglady went on to explain how growl was a <unk> who was so <unk> so <unk> that no one would work with him 
 he’d driven so many secretaries to tears that he didn’t have one anymore 
 he’d decided to work nights because apparently <unk> <unk> were around the office 
 & gt eveninglady : basically he’s a b % @ $ ^ 
 & gt me : okay 
 thats fine and all but where is his printer 
 ***** i knocked at an impressive door to an office i’d never visited before 
 i’d never even been to this part of the building before 
 it looked nice 
 & gt growl : come 
 i opened the door and looked around the office 
 it was an <unk> large office with large open windows <unk> probably the best view possible for the office 
 i couldn’t see a printer 
 a <unk> man sat on a swivel chair behind a huge desk 
 he did not look pleased 
 & gt growl : are you here for a social call 
 & gt me : social 
 no 
 i’m here for the printer from it 
 & gt growl : ohhhh it 
 you can probably imagine why i was confused 
 since i called so long ago 
 i’d just assumed you’d completely forgotten 
 i glanced at my watch 
 it had been almost exactly 15 minutes since he’d called 
 i decided to just ignore the <unk> he wasn’t worth it 
 & gt me : the printer 
 growl ambled up from his chair with a <unk> 
 & gt growl : it’s in the other room 
 i’d let you find it yourself but i’m afraid you’d get lost once you opened the door 
 i just shook my head at the man who seemed to take the smile on my face with offense 
 his face had <unk> even more then i thought possible 
 we approached a printer it looked reasonably new 
 its screen proudly displayed <unk> 
 & gt me : and the problem with the printer ... is 
 & gt growl : ah 
 & gt me : ... 
 & gt growl : well i was wondering to myself 
 how is it that someone who turns up so late and can’t grasp basic technologies even has a job 
 turns out you just get everyone else to do your work for you 
 normally i would take offense to the stream of insults but the smiles i gave him seemed to be making him even <unk> 
 it was much more <unk> 
 & gt me : it does seem to be working 
 & gt growl : you’ve not touched it 
 i wish i could have your job <unk> up everyday take a quick nap 
 go home 
 i turned on my <unk> and flashed an even bigger smile making a <unk> for the door 
 & gt growl : where are you going 
 & gt me : <unk> sleep rest whatever takes my fancy 
 i hope i don’t get lost on the way back 
 my voice said the words in a <unk> way the subtle implication of teasing <unk> in the tones of an idiot 
 <unk> face was that of concentration as if he were trying to work out if he was teasing an idiot or someone was teasing him 
 & gt growl : the printer can not scan to a usb drive 
 fix it 
 & gt me : it can not <unk> you couldn’t get it too 
 & gt growl : it does not 
 growl shuffled through it pockets for his usb drive eventually producing it after pulling out a deck of cards and a <unk> from his pockets 
 & gt me : i think you plug the usb drive into the printer first 
 i was talking extra slow in the tone of a teacher 
 making sure to <unk> every word 
 & gt growl : you think 
 i knew i should have just let you leave 
 this is useless 
 i don’t need a step by step guide just get it done 
 & gt me : then you press scan to usb 
 i’ll just find the button ... print 
 no ... .. direct print 
 no don’t want that one either ... .. fax 
 ... i was playing up the idiot vibe hard now 
 it was too fun i read out each individual option on the printer as if examining them carefully 
 growl eventually pushed me off the controls after i deliberately skipped the usb print option for the second time 
 & gt growl : geez 
 he hammered the scan to usb button hard 
 glaring at my bumbling nature 
 i stood smiling at him 
 the printer sprung to life as the document feeder grabbed the paper and fed it through the machine 
 i heard a faint sigh of finally '' 
 & gt me : oh see you can do it 
 good job 
 i <unk> him on the shoulder like a coach would a star player 
 the printer eventually finished 
 its screen lit up for the finish i awaited that glorious job complete notice that signaled i could leave this hell 
 <unk> & gt me : oh 
 & gt growl : an error 
 i can not believe it you think after calling professionals they’d get it done 
 just incompetence 
 if anything you’ve just wasted my time 
 i realized then the problem with playing up the idiot vibe 
 what if something really went wrong 
 you’ve lost all the respect to get it done 
 even if it is fun 
 & gt me : calm down 
 let me fix this 
 & gt growl : fix 
 i doubt you could fix me a coffee let alone fix something as complicated as a printer 
 insults about my coffee making skills 
 this guy ... <unk> time poster 
 i 'm a web developer actually not tech support but my organization does n't have dedicated support for our websites so i end up taking calls from time to time for the ones i work on 
 i walk into work one day not a care in the world ... until the receptionist calls me over 
 & gt receptionist : there 's a lady on the phone calling about <unk> 
 she 's swearing 
 & gt me : <unk> urge to run screaming from the building* i 'll take it in my office 
 i guess she calmed down a little when she was transferred to me because she was n't swearing initially 
 & gt woman : i ca n't play videos from <unk> 
 oh good i do n't have to deal with this after all 
 that 's my boss 's website not mine 
 i 'll just transfer this call and ... wait how do you ... transfer button ... stupid office phone ... oh forget it i 'll deal with it myself 
 i go through some basic troubleshooting questions figure out that she has a common android phone and that she ca n't play some standard youtube video <unk> on one of our sites 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry ma'am but i do n't think i can help you with this 
 the problem is either with your phone in which case you should contact the manufacturer or possibly your isp 
 & gt woman : i already talked with them and they said to talk to you 
 i just want to play your videos on my phone 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry ma'am but it is very unlikely that the problem is on our end 
 on the off chance that there is an issue with android phones i 'll let the developer of that site know to look into it 
 i knew that there was n't but at this point she was getting agitated and i just wanted to end the call 
 & gt woman : wait you do n't even know who i am 
 huh 
 why should that matter ... & gt woman : how can you fix it for my phone if you do n't know who i am or where i live 
 & gt me : uh well if there is an issue with android phones in general or your particular model the developer does n't need access to yours specifically he will fix it for them in general 
 & gt woman : i do n't care about other people 's phones i want you to fix it for my phone 
 wat 
 how do you expect me to do that fly out to your house and look at it in person 
 needless to say the call ended pretty quickly after that but not until after she started swearing <unk> friend helps me repair my car so i promise to build him a computer 
 i finished and delivered that computer to him 1 week ago 
 today he calls me up saying that its been running really slow 
 it takes so long for teamviewer to open that i give up and have him reboot the computer in safe mode 
 once connected this is what i see needless to say i will be taking the computer back and reformatting the drive 
 i will also be removing his admin rights 
 ftp 
 ltl 
 be kind 
 posting from phone 
 today starts like any other 
 headache and eye twitch check 
 coffee a likely source for my twitch check 
 phone <unk> <unk> 
 ... check & gt me : <unk> medical help desk this is <unk> 
 & gt tempuser : hello this is tempuser i ca n't see my icons to do my job 
 & gt me : ok what applications are you missing 
 & gt tempuser : <unk> app* & gt me : hmmm ... let me check a few things 
 so first and <unk> i should note i can already tell the user is new 
 our users are usually pretty good about giving an ip address first so we can remote in 
 some even insist that we remote in before telling us the issue 
 she did not 
 i search the user 's name in our ticket system and find a new user create task that is half finished 
 i also see she is a temp for one of our more turnover happy divisions 
 & gt me : it looks like the <unk> app* access is being created now 
 since we just made your computer login it has n't been finished yet 
 you 've ... & gt tempuser : <unk> me* then why when i log in as my supervisor does it show up but not under my login 
 another note the program she is asking about is presented by <unk> her group membership has not been added yet 
 & gt in my head : ** 
 battle stations battle stations set condition one throughout the ship 
 ** note 3 this is a major <unk> of aup at our org 
 & gt me : who 's login were you using 
 & gt tempuser : i ca n't tell you that ... & gt me : excuse me 
 & gt tempuser : ... & gt me : ... well that is a security violation and as such will be reported 
 do you have any questions 
 & gt tempuser : ... **click** & gt me : sigh so i report the user and lock her account in keeping with our protocol 
 the thing that gets me is aup is drilled into users from the word go is the first thing they see on the computers on a form they sign before getting their login and is even in the handbook 
 users man ... <unk> all this happened a few weeks ago but i 've only just discovered this wonderful subreddit i 'm sure i 'll have lots of content to post here as i am the only 'on site tech for an office of about 300 + other smaller offices 
 so a user calls in complaining that he recently changed his expired password and now his account is locked and he ca n't log in we use standard windows and active directory 
 i check ad and surely enough his account is locked i tell him that after 3 bad attempt it will lock 
 he thanks me for unlocking and hangs up 
 20 minutes or so later he calls again complaining that his outlook is prompting him for a password all the time 
 i check his account again in ad and it 's locked again 
 strange 
 i unlock it and say if it locks a 3rd time i will investigate further 
 surely enough 15 minutes or so later he calls and says it happening again 
 the most common cause of this is personal phones or tablets which have had work email added them failing to <unk> properly and causing a bad attempt 
 i ask if he 's got a personal devices added to his work email and he says yes just one phone 
 i ask him to remove the account he reluctantly does so despite already having a company issue blackberry with his email on it 
 the account continues to lock every 20 minutes or so 
 i call him to confirm that he does n't have any other personal devices at home which may be <unk> with the old password 
 he gets a bit aggressive and says 'i 've told you already no now fix this so i can get back to work 
 as internal support i never get this kind of tone i like to think i know most of the users here on a personal level and can chat happily away while fixing problems 
 i say that i 'll work on it and go ahead and contact our infrastructure team for help 
 one of the techs tell me there are other devices trying to connect to his account he will work on telling me exactly what in the next hour 
 i call the user and tell him what i know he snaps back at me <unk> is absolutely not my fault 
 i am so tired of it problems every week 
 i will speak with your manager about this 
 trying to avoid the obvious and point out that this is the first problem he 's every called in about i tell him that it 's best if we wait for the logs before we make any final decisions 
 he just huffs and <unk> and hangs up on me what a dick 
 at request they give me a log of all the login attempts to his account and even device id 's 
 i find the problem as suspected not only was there the one personal android phone he told me about there was also the following devices with his work email attached all of them had attempted to sync with his email in the past 2 days : * two android tablets * an ipad * a sony android phone * a google nexus phone * some model of iphone * a macbook pro now either this guy is handing out his login details to friends and family or he has <unk> with work email with 8 devices 
 <unk> even owns 8 devices 
 ** i call him and share the results there is a long silence 
 i break it by telling him that we ca n't allow his work email with sensitive client information to be <unk> with all those personal devices 
 there is a reason we have issued him a company blackberry 
 he then tells chews into me saying he needs to be always connected and it 's essential to his job and <unk> 
 tired of his shit i straight up tell him <unk> have issued you with a <unk> yet powerful laptop worth over <unk> and a blackberry which gives you access to your emails on the go why do you need 7 other devices which do the same thing 
 ignoring the point i made entirely he instead says he has recorded the conversation what 
 and will be taking it to my manager to in his words <unk> my utter incompetence at getting even the simplest thing fixed 
 i go to my manager first show the emails and logs from infrastructure and tell him to expect a <unk> email from the user 
 my manager who had been away for a few days preventing him from stepping in sooner 
 gives me the go ahead to disable his accounts and sends a <unk> request to the blackberry server on the grounds that he is unable to keep his client information secure and adhere to our <unk> standards 
 manager then called him and told him to come into the office for a <unk> 
 during this meeting which i sat in on just <unk> he was basically <unk> on how to use a blackberry securely and to absolutely never sync another personal device with it again under threat of account locking 
 i fed on his sweet sweet tears 
 thank you for reading 
 edit : formatting edit : thank you kind beautiful stranger for the gold i shall cherish it <unk> a $ 3 light beer became a $ 1500 light beer 
 i work at a university help desk during the school year 
 i 've seen some things 
 & gt female luser : my macbook wo n't turn on 
 & gt & gt slowa : okay i can help you at this cube 
 can i see your machine please 
 & gt & gt fluser pulls out her macbook pro and opens it up 
 i immediately notice two things : one there 's a certain stick to it when the lid opens 
 two there 's the faint smell of terrible cheap beer 
 & gt & gt slowa : what were you doing before it stopped turning on 
 & gt & gt fluser : i put my macbook in my bag yesterday and when i took it out today it would n't turn on 
 red flag number 1 
 & gt slowa : okay 
 let me try one of our shop chargers and see if we can get it to run mac resource inspector 
 & gt & gt i plug in the charger to the mac 
 the magsafe light does n't turn on 
 against my better <unk> i <unk> think that it 's just a dead magsafe adapter but that would n't explain the battery too 
 & gt & gt slowa : it looks like your internal charging adapter is dead 
 let 's open this up and see what the damage is 
 & gt & gt a few screws later and the back cover comes off 
 upon removing i 'm met with a much stronger aroma of $ 3 cheap beer 
 one look at the logic board and it 's pretty easy to tell what happened 
 & gt & gt slowa : did you ... spill cheap beer on this 
 & gt & gt fluser : i did n't i brought my bag to a <unk> party and someone spilled beer on and in my bag 
 how much is it to fix it 
 & gt & gt slowa : ... ... ... * attempting to logic why you would bring your $ 1500 facebook machine to a <unk> party 
 * * wat 
 wat 
 wat 
 logic not found 
 * * restarting ... * the liquid contact <unk> were <unk> <unk> instead of just the normal red that they would be with something like water or coffee 
 this meant that not only had beer been spilled on it but it was n't immediately <unk> off 
 red flags <unk> 
 & gt fluser : so how much is it to fix it 
 & gt & gt slowa : well ... $ <unk> for the logic board $ 80 for the magsafe your keyboard is sticky so it 's $ 120 for the <unk> your whole battery needs to be replaced so that 's another $ 150 your ram is probably dead so that 's $ 75 adding in labor for all of this is roughly $ <unk> 
 at this point it 's worth pulling your hard drive and seeing if we can get the data off it 
 have you got backups of your files 
 & gt & gt fluser : no 
 of course not 
 & gt slowa : well our hard drive recovery fee is a flat $ 40 for labor then $ 15 for every 100gb 
 we can take your computer and see if the data is pulled off it but we wo n't charge you if we ca n't get to the drive 
 & gt & gt fluser : okay do it 
 i took her computer upstairs to the hardware diagnostics room
