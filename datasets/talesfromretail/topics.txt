i work as a manager at a small chain of cstores ish locations i am putting away my main order of the week when a woman comes in asking for a nutrageous bar i told her with a smile we had some right in front of the store as i pointed right to a blank spot on the shelf turns out we had sold out over the weekend and i had just broken this poor womans heart and shattered her dreams with false hope she had been searching relentlessly for weeks and couldnt find one anywhere i apologized for the bad fortune and said i would order more straight away the woman sighed bowed her head and walked out of the store like a dejected puppy i turned back to the order opened the tub and right on top was a brand new box of nutrageous bars i tear open the box and vault over the counter like a bad ass cop sliding over a car hood sprinting out the door like i had just clocked out i caught up to her just as she starts to pull away from my store and from happiness most likely on her way to jump off a bridge hoping to find a nutrageous bar waiting for her in the next life she turned and saw me lumbering towards her holding the candy bar like a newborn child i had just delivered into this world i had never seen someone so happy over a candy she runs to me like she was a veteran returning home from duty and running towards their children for that first swirling embrace i tell her to have it on the house and have a good day then just now i get a call from my district manager demanding to know if i was the one who gave away a candy bar to a customer for free fuck i think to myself i do something nice for someone and this goddamn bitch calls my boss to tell on me so i tell my boss yeah it was me he tells me that she called and was so happy with our company she would be choosing us for the local volunteer fire fighter appreciation gifts this year in gift cards each for the volunteers my boss says he is giving me a commission for the gift cards minus the price of a nutrageous bar

a mother just came into my very small retail store with her three preteen kids normally this spells disaster however these kids each had a couple of s and thoughtfully looked through the items in the store before selecting something bringing it up to the register buying it with the money from their pockets and being extremely polite as they left the register the mom told the kids make sure you save your receipts so we can budget tonight one of the kids replied i always keep my receipts in the most polite way possible good on that mom for teaching her kids the value of money and financial planning just wanted to share because unlike most of the dross that comes through they made my day genuinely better
afternoon rtfr long time lurker first time poster you know the drill right this is the most exciting tfr story ive got this was back in i want to say before the proliferation of smartphones etc its about the time i worked at a gas stationconvenience store for one whole day and ended up as a manager and a district managers worst nightmare id taken the job not two days before and was told to show up at seven am on a monday for training no big deal right the manager tm certainly seemed stable enough at the time but i suppose thats what they say about all the crazies so i show up at am bright eyed and bushy tailed and ready to get to work im immediately introduced to the young lady yl whos been tasked with training me by tm tm spends the first twenty minutes of my shift not training me but ranting and rambling about how she just worked a double graveyard and how shes bushed and how this place just sucks her dry you get the idea then she reiterates that yls going to be with me all day training me step by step and is then gone in a puff of smoke gone home to get some muchdeserved sleep leaves her home number on a scrap of paper behind the counter in case of emergencies only sensible enough so we get down to business yls shocked that im already somewhat register and computerliterate and so takes the opportunity to abandon me in the backroom doing a few hours of computer training that i gather is supposed to encompass the entirety of my day when i finish my computer training i step out into the main store area to be relieved of duty yl instead informs me that were now going to do some handson training weird but fine i guess i mean im not going to scoff at a few extra hours on my paycheck so whatever lets do some hands on work the handson work goes on for about an hour and a half bringing my day to about four and a half hours at this point until yl pulls me aside and announces with a beaming shiteating grin on her face gtyl you know what i think yeah i think fuck this place gtcib fuck this place gtyl yeah man fuck it its bullshit anyway fuck everything i quit gtcib like in two weeks gtyl like i mean like now gtcib what with that she tears off her smock lights a cigarette and walks out of the joint leaving me to mind the store alone i dont know how to do cash drops i dont know how to do most of this shit ive been here for four hours tops you must be kidding me yl locks the door to the back room shoves the key underneath the door and is gone forever so like the nice young man i am i call tms emergency number the phone rings and rings and rings for maybe two minutes straight before she finally answers midsnore with a befuddled gttm whuzzah i promptly explain the situation to her and tell her that i need help she tells me to hold tight and that shes going to call her assistant manager am to come and help you know where this is going am never comes im waiting for another two hours and am never shows up i call tm back same deal two minutes of continuous ringing she promises something else hangs up on me we go through this process four more times over the course of two more hours when the next person onshift is due to show up anyway he never shows naturally so i call tm until she finally just takes her phone off the hook so i cant call her anymore this is the part of the story where i start to freak out i have no other numbers i know no one else who works here i am alone no way to clock out no way to hide no way to lock the doors nothing just work only work forever and ever and ever and ever i can see that this is how i die im sure of it im in a really shitty boring version of final destination at this point i feel the need to call out the dudes who ran the tattoo shop across the street theyd been coming in for cokes and energy drinks and such throughout the day and had taken a keen interest in my wellbeing they were pretty up on the situation and kept me reasonably calm throughout the day they noticed that i was starting to freak out asked me what the situation was i explained just like that these badasses jump into action they bring me their phonebook with all the numbers of the other stores in the area circled and they go to the local taco cart and get me a plate of tacos and a coke to keep my strength up im not into dudes but i considered asking these guys to marry me then and there fueled by tacos and sheer unadulterated panic i start making calls other stores are shocked by whats happened but dont have anyone to spare theyve got no one but one of them gives me the district managers dm home number bingo i explained the situation to him and listened as he went from perfectly congenial to absolutely terrified he tells me gtdm im coming down there to personally relieve you from your shift but then he says the perfect combination of words to set me off gtdm but im going to need about an hour and a half is that okay welcome to my breaking point i begin to shout and shout and shout gtcib no that is not alright tell you what dm either you get down here in half an hour or i am going to open the cash registers the safe turn the gas pumps on unlimited run and go home is that what you want free gas and free money for everyone who comes into the store until theres no more money is that what you want gtdm ill be there in twenty minutes i now see what has happened i have officially been taken hostage by this store and have taken it hostage in return i am now the crazy person in the situation im the movie bad guy im the one making demands but you know what he got there in fifteen minutes flat and you know what he was very nice all said and told he apologized profusely even helped me actually kick in the locked backroom door so i could clock out all properlike its pm finally but then tm in her pajamas eyes bloodshot and wild murderous and back from the dead like the last bad guy in die hard comes storming into the store screaming at dm who had apparently gotten her to answer her phone during his trip over gttm dm how fucking dare you tell me how to run my store i swear to fuck youve been telling me what to do for too long now and i am telling you for the last time dm turns to me as tm is shrieking and he says something that makes me start laughing like a psychotic gtdm go home cib ive got this shit you dont have to tell me twice amigo im gone when i get to the

 i was working a late shift and it was rather quiet i had only been working at the store for only months or so a man came through my line and he was about foot tall covered in tattoos and not the nicely made tattoos you see from a good tattoo shop i mean the kind that looks like he had them done in the cellar of a seedy biker bar type he was heavy built and wore a leather biker vest he did not seem the type to feel guilty about shanking you on the street he bought a few items but had beer i of course id him and he shows it to me and i total everything he pulls out a check book and writes a check the check had a basket of kittens on it and this seemed like one of those facebook posts of bikers look mean but have a heart of gold type things well i look at the check his name is nowhere on the check it has a girls name on it and i tell him that i could not accept it because it is not his check and does not have his name he claims the girl is with him and he would go get her real quick he leaves and left the check on the counter as soon as he is out of sight i call for a manager and they take the check and what i did not know was that about half an hour before an amber alert was released and being the fact this was about years ago very few people had sms alerts for things like this and only because our company is a certified safe place we receive faxes which had amber alerts and such the manager recognized the name and contacted police minutes later we had a few cops show up and they asked me what the guy looked like and everything said they even finger printed the stuff the guy was buying security gave them the footage of the guy and were lucky to get the guys plate number a few minutes later all the cops left and i mean in a hurry apparently the guy was spotted and pulled over they found the girl tied up in the back of the suv he was driving and luckily she was not hurt she was kidnapped from where she worked after school and her coworker called the cops when he got back from his break to find the place a mess and her missing the whole thing occured within an hour and half time she was taken to a local hospital where she was kept just in case over night the man was of course arrested
obligatory cell phone format apology here so i work in a store where we use short range radios with headsets to communicate with each other its a huge help to us and helps us be more efficient earlier today my boss sends me next door to the grocery store to buy donuts for the crew while im waiting in line a young boy maybe is shooting daggers at me im wearing my sunglasses inside with my earpiece still in as well as im leaving he yells to grab my attention heres the convo we had little kid lc hey me uhh yeah lc whats that for pointing to my ear piece by now i know where this is going me i cross my arms i use it for work lc come here i have another question mom looks at me with an eye roll because her kid is eccentric and that seems to annoy her not me weird kids always give me a laugh i bend down to his level to hear then he whispers lc do you work for the government me i put my finger over my ear piece eagle this is condor cover blown i repeat eagle our cover us blown then i take me and my donuts and run out of the store as fast as possible while the mom is dying of laughter and the kids jaw is on the ground because he just met a secret agent highlight of my day edit i did not use my secret agent authority to commandeer those donuts he grabbed my attention after i paid and was getting ready to walk out
so let me first off explaining about how my store manager looks to most people he is so he is tall and seems very intimidating but different from his looks he is actually a very nice guy and this was how i learned what kind of guy he was i had only been working for about months at the store and this woman walked in with two little kids one was about years and the other was years ago there mother looked scared her hair was a mess and looked like she had no sleep in days she looked rough well she walks up to me and asked to see the store manager so i call for him i was working check out that day so it was pretty slow compared to others so i had breathers between the customers and i over heard the woman talking to him she escaped her husband who was abusive and lived in the neighboring town she had gotten an apartment with the help of a friend of hers but she had nothing to eat and she asked him for help the store manager told her to go fill a buggy with food and to come to my line when she was done and told her to get herself and her children some hot food from the deli also so she left and about half an hour later she came to my line and i called him back he showed up and told me to ring it up like normal and then he pulled out his wallet and paid for the womans cart then he asked me to come to his office and asked her to wait there he said he wanted me to help take things to her car and to give her a paper he was writing on so he handed me the paper and i walked her to her car then handed her the paper he had given me to hand her she started crying and i asked her if she was ok she handed me the paper it basically was a note telling her he was sorry for her position and if she needed a job to help her to get by that she could show up in a couple of days and told her if she needed child care he had his number on there to call him and he would help set it up for her needless to say she showed up and she is a very nice person who still works at our store this is one of the many reasons why i love the store i work at and i believe i have the best store manager in the world
some of you may recognize this story since i posted it before elsewhere but again this is the perfect sub for it and its a happy story we all like happy stories this story starts long ago in the dim ages when bear and bison swarmed the forest and the prairie or about which ever you prefer i was working at a sporting goodsautomotive store at the time at the customer service counter a father and his son who appeared to be about came in and asked where the camping equipment was i pointed them towards the two areas that held our camping merch and was about to go about doing something else boring when the boy piped up im going on my first boy scout campout now if youve read my other stories youll know that im an eagle scout i take this position very seriously and will do everything in my power to encourage and help young scouts on their trail to eagle so i looked over at my boss a nice lady who hired me because of my outdoor experience in scouting and asked if i could go help these people personally she smiled and said yes the father was completely out of his element with camping gear by his attitude and behavior i would guess that he had never gotten further out of the city limits than a highway in his life everything in the aisle perplexed him but thankfully his sons troop had given them a list of what equipment theyd need so for about minutes or so i went through the list with them point by point explaining what each thing was what it did what version to use and how kybo tape is the scout term for toilet paper that got quite a bit of laughter during this time i also talked with the kid he was very new to scouting only having joined a couple months prior he was enthusiastic about getting to go out into the wilderness and camp and make campfires and fish and all the other activities hed heard about i talked about my experiences in scouting which was all of what he was talking about and so much more climbing mt hood going to national jamboree touring military bases rafting down the deschutes the kid was very impressed i kept telling him this is only the start you have no idea how awesome it can get so we finally have a cart filled with a small tent sleeping bag cooking equipment small first aid kit beginner backpack rope you and yer fuckin rope shovel water bottle etc etc etc quite a haul but id done my best to get everything that the kid would need while still keeping things cheap well cheapish the total was something like a bit over now they say that a picture is worth a thousand words but if i could have taken a picture of the dads face when the total came up it would be worth a much longer essay it was a shockfearresignation combination that said damn i didnt expect it to be this much but hes so excited i cant tell him no it would break his heart maybe if i just eat ramen for the next couple weeks i can afford this as dad reached reluctantly for his wallet i flashed him a smile looked at my boss and knocked off the total a scout is helpful and kind i quoted the father thanked me profusely as did the son they left with a spring in their step and smiles on their faces my boss said that was very nice but dont ever do that again i replied but boss you do realized that from now on they are going to be in here on a regular basis to buy camping equipment right i know that kids look hes just like me at that age and hes going to be spending a lot of dads money here she laughed agreed and the deed was put out of my mind as other customers approached but the story isnt done yet dear reader for about a week later look who comes running through the door but our little firsttime camper with dad trailing along this kid very specifically wanted to see me because he had pictures and he wanted to show them to me awwww sweet sure lets take a lookhey i know this camp i know exactly where you were so we talked about being at that camp and taking the hike down the hill to the old camp location and how the fishing in the lake is and the deer that just dont care that you are around and how the chow hall seems to be made mostly of sieves given how drafty it is we had a brag board up for the hunters who had trophy hunts so i pinned a couple of the better pictures to the board this kid beamed with pride then ran off to use the bathroom this is when dad chimed in and thanked me for a much more personal reason he and the kids mom had gone through a fairly nasty divorce and she had majority custody scouting events were one of the few ways that dad could spend extended quality time with his son and this camping trip had been very good for the both of them he got a little choked up about it as did i i simply told him this is what scouting is all about help other people at all times this is just the tip of the iceberg over the next year they became regulars of the store i knew which troop they were with a large and active one so they were pretty consistently in need of various consumable camping supplies more pictures got posted to the brag board his first summer camp saw him earn four merit badges and the mile swim badge i started to volunteer with his troop as a merit badge counselor and had a great time however real life gets in the way school and a couple of new jobs meant i couldnt devote the time i needed to to help his troop out we basically drifted apart and the other things going on in my life made me forget about him and his dad until late in i get a phone call out of the blue the voice on the other end is deeper self confident is osiris there yeah thats me who is this its that young scout from the store calling me up to invite me to his eagle court of honor i stood there in my kitchen in mute shock all those memories of helping him out came flooding back you better believe ill be there ill even try to fit into my old uniform and so i did though i eschewed the shorts and went for pants this young boy now turned into a young man stood tall and proud as they pinned the eagle medal to his shirt recited the eagle charge and gave a short speech thanking people whod made a difference in his life he looked right at me as he gave the speech pointed me out and said this guy right here he was the first adult to encourage me his example as an eagle was what i followed i cannot thank him enough tears flowed following the ceremony i found his dad scouting had made both of them better people hed decided that being bitter towards his kids mom wasnt what a scout leader oh yeah he was now an assistant scoutmaster the bug bites very hard should be doing this had allowed their divorce to become more amicable and they had successfully renegotiated custody some time earlier he was a happier man and was so proud of his son i was pretty sure his chest was going to burst his son now tall strong confident and an obvious leader was destined to go places he would be graduating high school the next spring and was looking at getting into college for a degree in psychology with a minor in criminal justice he wanted to live his oath and law by being a police officer my own chest felt like it was going to burst at this point i still keep in touch with him hes now coming up on his st birthday and is readying applications for various police departments around town ive already told him that id gladly be his reference because hes one of the guys we all want to become a cop someone with a strong and steadfast sense of duty honor integrity generosity and kindness of spirit hell make a damn fine officer and i can say that a little part of that just a little part is because of my willingness to help him choose tents one day several years ago tldr just read it itll do your soul some good
this happened yesterday while the story linked happened a few months ago my husband and i are done shopping at the local grocery store we are next in line at the selfcheckouts there are only two selfcheckouts open at the time and both have customers who have just started their transactions we have maybe items or so we hear a voice from behind us gtwoman do you mind if i go in front of you i only have things we arent in a hurry so i turn fully prepared to say sure go ahead when i recognize the woman its the customer from this so instead i smile and ask gtme have you ever worked in a customer service position gther yes gtme did you ever have a customer who acted so appallingly that it stuck in your memory gther yes gtme you were the woman at my store who dropped something and instead of picking it up yourself or asking for assistance went snap snap point at me so how bout you wait your turn she started to say something back but at this point my husband started laughing pretty hard he said afterwards it was mostly in shock since i dont usually stand up for myself much and she just pursed her lips and stood there it was an awkward couple of minutes waiting after that
i work at an ice cream shop and when children come in with their parents i sometimes like to playfully ask the kids if they wanted to pay instead of the parents it gets the kids talking if theyre not too shy and it makes the parents chuckle today i asked a little girl in a dress if she was going to pay and she said i cant because i dont have any money or a credit card mom laughed and then part way through the transaction she decided to buy a gift card she gave it to her daughter to use as a credit card and told her to keep it safe next time she comes in she can definitely pay i thought that was the sweetest thing and the mom is a regular customer it made me very happy today during a frustrating shift 
a lovely little tale of how i went shopping and managed to get fired lets give you some context to help you out though my brother and i are half chinese years apart and im and hes just under we have different fathers so its always weird to hear wow you guys look the same when we really dont he has a fair few more pounds on me too so ive a day off and im going to meet my friends ive got minutes to kill and im mulling over whether or not im going to grab a new graphics card for my computer my brother gets discounts which ive never used but i figured if there was something worthwhile i will get it on his discount so i go into the shop and im staring at graphics cards comparing one to another im stood there for a good minutes before someone then comes up to me and just stares at me whats up i end up asking tentatively as its obvious they want my attention i notice shes got a nametag and like me shes wearing a plain black tshirt however she doesnt have a problem with my tshirt why are you wearing jeans obviously im bewildered but she just goes on you know what the policy is here so i cant help but laugh i figure shes having a laugh with me and that its an interesting way to try and close a sale electronics shop with a dress code hilarious this however isnt the desired response as the mood flips completely shes shaking shaking with rage at the fact im just giggling in her face like a girl get into the office right now she tries to lead me by the arm like im a naughty schoolchild and she was even more enraged by the fact i withdrew my hand from her disregarding my confused expression and comment of what the fuck she runs off in under a minute shes brought back a heavy set bloke who looks pretty unhappy with the fact hes been brought out unlike everyone else who i notice is wearing a black tshirt and black trousers hes in casual clothes hes the boss hes now getting increasingly unhappy as she fills in the encounter with stories of my incompetence and of the recent struggle so i cut in i argue about how this is an understanding and i get told to zip it that expression was genuinely used i was then berated while i try to cut in to explain the situation im also now running out of time so i then try to call my brother so he can get his ass here and sort it all out however he then has the nerve to take my phone off me and then really lay into me about having my phone on the sales floor he tries to then take me to the back office as weve got a crowd growing but i shrug them off im swearing hes swearing and then it comes im fired youre not him bullshit he then grabs me and starts dragging me to the door and im flailing around trying to stay on my feet kicking boxes and shelves and finally were at the door to which im pushed out of hes then stood blocking the doorway aghast with how i acted stating how appalled he is my phone starts ringing and i see its my brother he had a dropped call from me i answer and immediately tell him to run back to work hes on his lunch break minutes away and i then decide to take it further i tell his boss to get fucked i swear i make a scene were on the street and people are stopping to watch the theater unfold before them hes calling the police theres vile things said and gestured and then my brother turns up his look is golden but what im enjoying much more is the look of his boss the look of his supervisor god how i loved the look on her face as while the manager was going on in heaves she had such a smug look so i pulled the race card as well as a half chinese guy can anyway and apologies were so forthcoming and suddenly they werent barring the door they were trying to bring us both in if this was the us we might have been able to make a bigger deal of this but a typical english town not so much but i went to listen to the apologies just to fob them off on the upside i got a free gtx wouldnt give me anything better but hey wish i was able to put this more eloquently but hey

so i work in fairly expensive ice cream shop and ive only recently had this job were open from am to pm and one day two weeks ago i had a shift that started right at so i show up in my uniform ten minutes until and outside the door is a mom and her three young daughters patiently waiting for our store to open so they can get a treat i dont have access to a key and the doors are locked i peered inside and my manager is focused on the register i knock on the door to get his attention so he can let me in so i can get prepared for my shift and when i do that one of the little girls looks up at me with a frown and says gtyou need to wait it caught me completely off guard and i manage to say but i work here and dont have the key to get in mom bursts out laughing it was all good my manager lets me in and a few minutes later we open and the family gets their ice cream i just thought it was funny and kind of sweet that the girl told me off for potentially being a rude and impatient customer
two stories in two days yep i worked at national sandwich chain for two years and in that time i saw some crazy crap going down not everything was bad however as weird and bizarre as my town is there are some good people that live here one afternoon as i was starting my shift at national sandwich store a dad and his son came in to get a sandwich this kid was maybe years old and as cute as could be he had been saving up his money to get one of our kids meals and he was so excited to get to pick out everything he wanted on his sandwich he added a cookie and a chocolate milk to complete the order and everything got put into one of the new awesome lion king bags we had i totally got one for myself when we got to the register he pulled out his spider man wallet and pulled out the money he needed it was all bunched up and wadded but he carefully placed it on the counter and then looked at me i have adults that hand me wads of cash so its nothing new to reach across the counter and smooth it all out before i end the transaction however as i started to reach for it his dad stopped me gtdad no son this wont do gtson what did i do dad gtdad well its rude to just throw your money in a ball at the cashier you need to be polite and take the time to straighten out each bill and then hand it to her so she can get you the right amount of change the dad took the bills straightened them out and handed them back to the little boy to try again gtdad this is the right way to give the cashier your money theyll always appreciate you for it little boy was so excited when i took the money from him and gave him back his change and his lunch bag he shouted thank you and took his dads hand to be on his way thank you to that dad for teaching his son that retail workers are people too
so i currently work at a gas station our usual customers being from the neighborhood down the street i also live in the same community so most of our customers are neighbors recognize me from around the area have mutual friends etc quite an ideal retail job for me as a result i am happier way more personable and i love love love of the people i see everyday first name basis the whole yards anyhow two days ago i get this creature who is just a nightmare i should have seen the signs since the only rude people i get are not from around here or unfortunately stereotypically rich old entitled white women this lady spewed vileness from her veins i swear i felt the disturbance in the force and i had good reason she decided to purchase two twelvepack cases of soda from two separate exceptionally popular companies if you purchase two from the same company you receive a discount of what totals to a few dollars its stated as such on the signage for both displays she grabs these two cases as well as a bottle of cheap wine and is unresponsive to the whole transaction after she pays she notices that the computer didnt take the money off for the discounted price oh great you didnt discount me the sign states blah blah blah oh it had to be two cases from the same company if you want to change i can are we done here sorry wha are we done here are we done here are we done here uh sure she starts to turn but quite a line has amassed by this point most are regulars next in line is my hero regular customer who is kinda tall lots of tattoos fairly intimidating to some im sure but always friendly to me i just wanted this bitch gone but what was next made my day i dont remember exactly how he put it but it made my day you shouldnt be so rude to people when theyre explaining why youre wrong its none of your business well if you read the signs rather than being rude itd be your business its none of your are we done here are we done here are we done here i love my regulars

a couple years ago i was a manager for a fashionable plus size clothing store i absolutely loved it the bad customers were bad as expected and sometimes awful also as expected but at least they gave me something to laugh about with my co workers however the good customersthey were why i worked there ampnbsp one day a woman in her mids came in with her husband and three boys she was wearing a pullover and baggy jeans she was sweet but very reserved about trying on clothes she told me that hadnt purchased womens clothing for several years and was hoping i could help her with jeans one could say that she was ahem all about that bass regardless of her weight she was an extremely beautiful and darling woman her family was super supportive of helping here regain some of her self esteem i was pumped to help her out a process this big was going to take a while so i urged her family to wait on the supplied benches while she and i got to work so we shopped grabbing some cute tops and fun bras we talked about how to build wardrobes and mixandmatch pieces and then we got to the danger zone jeans ampnbsp i guessed that she was about a size and after discussing different cuts of denim we settled on higher rise high stretch skinny jeans they would accommodate her proportionately small waist and large posterior ampnbsp we got into the fitting room and i eagerly coaxed her to try on one of the outfits i had picked out for her a few moments later she called me over to come into the fitting room i slipped inside to see her i havent felt this beautiful for a long time she said to me there were tears in her eyes and a huge grin on her face ampnbsp i motioned for her husband and kids to come see as soon as the husband saw her he choked up i couldnt get over the grin on his face there was so much love in his eyes you look absolutely gorgeous babe ampnbsp they ended up getting her almost an entirely new wardrobe ive never seen a happier family
a little backstory first back in i was having a lot of family issues at home so i went to visit my mothers two sisters in idaho for a change of scenery theres a resort there owned at the time by a billionaire who also owns a line of gas stations that use a dinosaur for their logo its a very high end resort drawing some of the nations most rich and famous bruce willis arnold schwarzeneggar clint eastwood and many other people of that caliber visited andor owned vacation homes there i liked it so much i decided to make the move long term and found an apartment and a job as a baristo in a coffee shop not sbucks thats where the story starts it was about pm and i remember it being either november or december mostly because of all the snow the shop closed at and i was doing some cleaning ahead of time so i could get out of work at a decent hour a man walked in the ball cap on his head pulled down to cover his eyes and his head down against the biting wind blowing in from the mountains i greeted him and when he looked up i recognized him i was told to act normal when a celebrity walks in as they justifiably dont like being mobbed by fans out here i took his order which i remember as small lattes he was alone so i assumed he was in town with his wife and she was either at their vacation home or shopping at one of the many expensive shops there the total came to its funny i cant remember what i had for breakfast but i remember the total of bruce willis coffee order from years ago growing up the son of an accountant with a strong desire borderline obsessive sometimes to gain my fathers approval i learned to do change in my head at lightning speed less than seconds after seeing the he was about to hand me i told him his change would be he paused a little smirk on his face bw did you do that in your head me yes sir bruce then puts the back in his wallet and pulls out a bill two bills and three quarters totaling and asks me what the change is i tell him he proceeds to repeat this a few more times with different combinations of cash he has on him i dont know if some combination of fatigue and jet lag put him in a condition where he found my petty math amusing but he was having fun i finally had to end it since i still had stuff that needed to be done cleaning the soft serve machine takes no less than minutes me i have to get back to work so ill do one more if i get it right you have to tip me that last part was a joke obviously he agrees and pulls out before he can move his eyes from the money to mine i say its bw thats pretty cool me when youre and bruce willis tells you something that you take for granted is cool it tends to leave you speechless i made his coffee gave it to him and wished him a good night before he left he dropped in the tip jar and told me i earned it he was such a cool guy lots of respect for him
guys i just had a story from the zoo less than hours ago i should not have one from the valet already and yet here i am because this is not the first time ive had this conversation a woman notices our sign that states we are hiring drivers as she pays for her valet she is chatting with me about it mentioning how sorry she feels for the drivers that stand outside in the cold she says my job as the cashier seems so much nicer and i agree because well it is she asks what my shift is and i tell her mondayfriday i let her know we have location that needs cashiers for all shifts and my location needs a pm cashier mondayfriday she asks for an application which i gladly give her this is where it goes downhill once the application is in her hand she suddenly looks very smug can i mail this back instead of bringing it here she asks unusual but ok i write down the address and hand it to her she snatches it out of my hand scratching me with her nails she offers no apology but instead i get a suddenly nasty tone so how do i get your job i blink at her and explain what my shift is and then explain the available shifts again i get about halfway through before she interrupts me yeah yeah i heard you but i want your job i want that shift how do i get it well maam i dont plan on quitting any time soon i really need this job so getting my exact shift wouldnt really you could just go work outside with the rest of them youre young they would make you go out there how do i get your job i sigh and point to the boxes on the application where she can mark her preferred shift and position have fun out there in the cold she cackles as she walks off i smile at my good fortune as the only mailing address we have is for corporate so that is what i gave her corporate passes applications along to managers solely on the east side of the city and my location is the only one on the west side and we do our own hiring which i would have explained to her if she hadnt turned into the wicked witch ah well

so i have been working in a fast food chain for about six months now its a pretty low business store and my co workers are all pretty funny and chill to be around im in the back making food on the night shift its really dead and there is only two employees me making the food and another taking the very few and far in between orders an older man in his mid sixties or so comes in and orders a burger and fries pretty standard and since business was slow i make it fresh off the grill he eats the burger and comes back up to the counter pretty awkwardly i was worried he was going to complain because our manager had left to grab some coffee from the nearby gas station can i see the person who made this burger he demanded and my co worker haplessly pointed me out so i approach the counter from the back and he reaches out and shakes my hand son thats the best sandwich ive had in years i dont know what you did to it but its amazing i stood there with a stupid grin and said thank you then he slipped me a dollar bill tipped his hat and left its the small things like this which make me kinda like my job
this isnt my personal experience but rather the story of my classmate he works at a fast food restaurant and recently he was in an altercation at work he rang up a customers order and added nacho cheese onto his meal which is a little extra he informed the customer just to double check and he had in fact misheard him then promptly removed the cheese from the order well the customer for whatever reason didnt believe him my classmate insisted that he did take the cheese off the order and he wasnt being charged for it the customer called him a liar then reached across the counter and punched him in the mouth splitting his lip and resulting in a trip to the hospital which required stitches now the customer is being taken to court on an assault charge which could get my classmate upwards of dollars all over nacho cheese edit clarifications
so heres this bloke about its early in the morning and hes getting food from our breakfast bar so he can eat breakfast with his ish son theyre behind a lady in line who has actual groceries so when they walk up the lady is about halfway through paying but the instant the dad reaches my line he tries to hand me his cash for his order i tell him sir if youll give me just one second i can finish up with this woman and ill be right with you he glares at me but retracts his money a minute later the lady leaves and i turn back to the man who shoves his twenty at me and then stares at me blankly when i take it i weigh his food ring him up and it comes out to like or something i tell him that thats his total and he just stares at me and takes his food i shrug and put it into the register now once you enter the amount into the computer youre not supposed to change it even if you know for sure the amount in the register will be the same its just company policy so as im putting the twenty in he goes wait i was going to give you the cents why the fuck didnt you then i think but whatever sorry i should have asked unfortunately i cant change it now that ive put it into the computer he tries to convince me to for a minute then he gets mad and says your way or the highway right bitch he yanks his change from my hand and walks off with his very awkwardlooking son heres where the story gets impossible im going on with my day forgotten all about the guy ringing up other people when i hear a little throat clear from the end of my register i look over and its the guy and you wont believe what he said he said i am so sorry about earlier he really did he apologized he explained that he has low blood sugar that makes him very cranky but that that was no excuse and he felt so bad for being so rude and short with me i told him it was absolutely fine and he wished me a beautiful day and left he apologized a real customer actually gave me an unprompted apology for their rudeness i spent the rest of the day just glowing with happiness
little bit of preface im a manager at a fast food burger joint in a small town im also gayer than elton john doing a cover of somewhere over the rainbow while dressed in drag so sometime after our supper rush had died down i went into the cooler to count my inventory when that was all said and done i came back out onto the floor to help out my coworkers prepare for their preclosing stuff however as i wear glasses they immediately fog up due to the change in temperature my coworkers started to laugh at me so to make it even better i put on my best southern accent and yelled oh lawdeh help me i dear say ive gahn blahnd cue coworkers laughing their butts off because i legitimately sounded like a southern dame or something meanwhile a customer on front counter who couldnt see me at the time needed to get his order taken so i went up front to help him out he refuses to let a man help him instead stating that he wanted the cute sounding southern gal to help him out not wanting to let him down i put the voice back on and say oh my gawd a suitor at this hour god bless momma the man flushes orders something quietly and leaves edit ive gotten some creepy and demanding pms about delivering i dont like the idea of just sharing my voice online sorry

so i work in a coffeedonut shop once a year we have a rather popular contest where coffee cups have tabs that might get you a car five grand visa gift cards or gift cards to our shops most of the time though you will win a free coffee or donut which suits our customer base fine now one day a teenage couple comes in somehow not sure why but i knew they were going to pull something they dont come up to order together the girl comes up first she hands me a winning tab and orders the most expensive drink on the menu honestly i dont care the drink is easy to make and i would do the same thing besides the drink is allowable by contest rules while waiting for the machine to fill the cup i glance at the tab its torn in half only showing the english part of the bilingual tab not that big a deal the tabs are annoying to rip off the cup but coffee sense is still tingling so i dont put it in the container and just set it aside i hand her her cup wish her a nice day and she almost leaves loitering around the door as her boyfriend comes up to the counter what a surprise he also wants the same size and type of drink he also has half a winning tab but sacre bleu its all in french this is a moment i have only dreamt of i smile grab the previous tab and place both together in front of him slowly as if im a csi scientist i dont say anything to him just smiling and he bolts out dragging his girlfriend with him which is a shame i was about to offer him a smaller non contest cup and lid so they could both share edit man lots of canadians on this subreddit d tried to make the coffee shop as vague as possible but i cant fool my fellow canucks

this happened a few months ago but just got reminded of it recently so backstory i work in the wireless department in a big department store the wireless section is outsourced and technically i dont work for said department store and im really only able to do transactions related to cell phones that said if im not busy with a wireless customer ill go and help customers who are looking for stuff ive worked here long enough that i know where a lot of stuff is and sometimes electronics is understaffed so one time i have someone come by looking for batteries those little button kinds usually a cr well a lot of customers have trouble finding the right size so i lead her to the batteries area and help her pick out the battery i then gave a short im actually part of the wireless center here if you ever need help with a cell phone etc etc oh actually since youre here i did have an issue with my cell phone she mentioned that she recently got a new cell phone and she wasnt happy with it i asked if she got it from our store or any of the locations we had and she didnt she got the phone directly from the carrier she didnt have the phone with her but she said she got the latest model for a particular line of phones btw im in canada so for high end cell phones this one was about usually youd have to go for a year term of at least a month with a upfront device cost recently they dropped the minimum rate for some carriers to but at the time it was still minimum per month i asked her what was wrong with it it doesnt call fast enough that struck me as odd at first i assumed that she meant that little pause between pressing the call button and when it starts ringing when the phone is trying to connect i probe for a bit more detail well she goes on to say how she always listens to the radio and how theres always these contests where a certain caller number will win some sort of money prize or concert tickets or whatever and shes annoyed that shes never able to call into the radio stations or when she does she doesnt win im pretty baffled at this i basically reply that theres got to be tons of people trying to call at the same time and there are a ton of factors as to whether or not she would be able to get through she was annoyed because she thought that this model was supposed to be the best phone in the market she then asks how other people are able to call in and win these contests again its pretty much chance i just replied saying maybe they programmed the phone to have the stations on speed dial or maybe they had an app that helps them dial repeatedly or faster she then asks what an app was and i had to explain what apps are and how she can get apps on the phone lastly she asked me if i knew what phones people who are winning radio contests are using no i dont i then went back to my manager and the conversation went something like gt so yeah she got a phone model and isnt happy with it gt why gt she says shes not winning radio contests gt stop there im done
i work as a cashier in a high end grocery store the other day an older european lady came through my lineup i asked her how she was doing if she needed bags etc of course she doesnt reply so i start scanning her stuff and place them in bags anyways a package of radishes scan through and show up as the conversation goes as follows her stop right there why are they me thats the usual price her the fucking sign said me ok well ill call someone the produce manager comes over and tells her that theyre her this is fucking absurd i need to see the sign you have to honour the price on the sign i want them free this isnt fair the manager takes her over to the radishes and it turns out she was looking at the wrong fucking sign and the price was actually she then comes back pays for the rest of her stuff throws the radishes at my face and leaves i later found out that she comes in about times a week and argues with the employees to get free stuff shes apparently made my co worker cry on separate occasions edit holy shit this exploded loving all of the vegetable puns and for the people telling me if i should press charges id prefer not to because she did not really cause any bodily harm just made my retail experiences a wholeeeeeeeeee lot more interesting needless to say though i will be speaking to my manager about banning her 
i used to work in electronics for a large department store so it was common i dealt with large purchases of tvs game systems cameras etc usually these were all paid for by card id been through the training on how to detect counterfeit bills though since some people still used cash a middleaged man walks around the department for a bit and after helping him pick out a tv i go to ring him up the purchase came to around paid for in bills the man smiles and in a very thick eastern european accent boasts i printed those myself i laugh and go to put the money away but it feels lighter than normal i do the usual tests holding it up to the light scratching the surface and it fails all of them this guy actually tried to use printed money at this point i call over a department lead to help me out because ive never dealt with counterfeit bills before he smiles at the guest says well hold his tv in the backroom for a minute while we complete the transaction and leads him away from the department after around minutes i was told i was being replaced in electronics and spent the last two hours of my day giving a police report tldr guy tries to buy an expensive tv proudly announces hes using money he printed at home gets arrested
preface this is a prepaid nocontract carrier store the way these work were not a corporate franchise but rather an independentlyowned authorized dealer much like a car dealership we have a few locations under our dealership but the rest are owned by different dealers this means that inventory and returns are not shared across all locations if you bought your phone at a location thats owned by another dealer you must return or replace it there we often have problems with customers trying to return merchandise from other dealers locations i always try my best to explain that although we cant take them back wed be more than happy to call the other location and see if they can alternatively we also offer them a discount or a free accessory if they choose to buy a phone from us that way we win their business most of the time we resolve the issue sometimes they get upset and leave this guy was something else older man id say late s wearing a cheap suit with a consumerist attitude and a sense of entitlement we had a few customers in the store and my coworkers and i were trying to help everyone as quick as possible gt me welcome to store name how can i help you gt c my wifes phone isnt working i need you to fix it gt me sure whats going on with it gt c it wont make phone calls gt me okay let me take a look at it i inspect the phone and realize that its a model that we dont carry at our location so i already know they didnt buy it from us the phone has no signal i try power cycling the phone running network updates and everything i can to fix it no dice gt me alright the phones not getting signal ive tried resetting it and updating it and its not doing much looks like you got a defective phone where did you gt c well no shit thats what i just said i just need you to fix it gt me of course where did you get it gt c i got it from you guys gt me are you sure we havent carried this model in a while gt c it says carrier name on it where else would i have gotten it gt me i mean which location did you get it from gt c i dont know where she got it arent you guys carrier name gt me yes but were all seperately owned and it sounds like she mightve gotten it from a different location let me scan the barcode to see if it came from our s gt c look dont waste my fking time i just need you to fix it there were kids in the store so the swearing bothered me gt me look im sorry but i cant replace it if she got it somewhere else the best i can d gt c thats bullshit let me speak to your manager now i had some heavy dental work done that morning and they gave me some good shit for the pain so i was feeling a little brave the guy was being a total douchebag swearing in front of kids and being all around unreasonable so i thought to myself that if im going to kick him out eventually i might as well fk with the guy a little gt me no gt c excuse me gt me i dont think he or any of us want to deal with your crap right now im here trying to help you out and youre just being a prick gt c what did you just call me you get your fking manager right now or i will have your fking job what is your name gt me we dont really have a manager but heres the owners information we have two business cards one of them has the owners information for customers like this for when the owners not around it says store name john smith general manager with the owners cellphone number gt c and what is your name as he furiously picks up his phone gt me you dont really need my name just tell him its the employee that doesnt put up with pricks like me gt c yeah okay well see how funny you are when you lose your job he calls the owner most of the customers that were in at the time were regulars so they were secretly in on what was about to happen my cellphone rings i pick it up with a smile gt me this is john smith at store name how can i help you everyone in the store cracks the fk up gt c this is fking bullshit i dont know what kinda bullshit game youre playing here but im taking my business elsewhere gt me im counting on it have a nice day edit whoever sent me gold i would unofficially hire you for a day and let you kick out all the rude customers you want

okey dokey so im taking tech appointments in store for the phones that rule everyones life and i get to this customer mary mary is a very nice woman of perhaps mid s to early s i walk up and introduce myself and ask whats going on she tells me that she was in a few days before because her phone kept shutting off and she was about to do a major cross country drive la to nyc by herself and she was worried about her phone not working so when she was in about five days before the battery failed testing worn out this can certainly cause random shut downs so they changed the battery at cost cause she was out of warranty only it was still shutting down theres a set of on board error logs so i took a look holy crap screen after screen of a major error dating back like a month basically this error is the same as a kernel panic on a computer for those that dont know computers its the blue screen of death blown logic board level issue this phone was super critical and lucky to be alive of course this is something the first tech should have caught but having checked to see who it was from the service notes hes a bit of a lazy ass me i check that log every time i would rather catch an impending failure before it happens than miss it so im a tad miffled hes going to get feedback later now i have to tell the customer that we missed the right call the first time and she has to replace the whole phone for a lot more like once you put the tax in but i tell her im going to go talk to my manager about taking off the cost of the battery replacement because thats just not fair shes cool with this and with paying the difference i go to my manager and explain whats up he agrees its not fair only he says well just cover the whole thing or payback for making her come a second time he didnt have to do this but to him it felt like the right thing to do who was i to argue i get the replacement phone do the paperwork swap the sim etc we get every thing set up on the new phone one the old one erased she pulls out her credit card and i tell her i dont need that she says she hasnt paid and i tell her that she doesnt have to my manager is going to pay for it since we messed up and didnt fix it the first time she loses it zero to in like two seconds im talking hands shaking snot nosed tears every where me i go and get some tissues for her to clean up her face no big deal i ask her if she needs hug cause i have few with me she says yes i give her a hug and say happy mothera day which almost got her crying again my manager happened to walk by right then and gave me a look like is everything okay i guess mary picked up on it cause she asked if he was the manager i said yes and she hugged him too tldr read it and get your daily feels 
this one happened a few days ago i work the customer service desk at a department store lady came up with about three bags of clothes she wants to return the ensuing conversation went something like this gtme do you have your receipt gtcustomer oh no ive done hundreds of returns here with no receipt gtm okay are you a member of our rewards program gtc no gtm okay so without a receipt ill have to give you store credit with a deduction on each item gtc ohhh no no no no ive done this hundreds of times and ive never had a problem they always look it up with my credit card at this point she tosses her credit card down on the counter i dont want instore credit i want my money back gtm no im sorry but the only way we have to look up receipts is if youre in our rewards program gtc no thats not true im telling you ive done this over and over again and ive never had a problem im a decorator i buy crap here all the time i learned a while back that when someone just wont accept what youre saying have another employee confirm it sometimes people just need to hear the same damn information from two people before they even start to accept it so fortunately our store manager was ringing up a customer at the lanes across from where i was i confirm with her that we can in fact not look up receipts using a credit card gtc this is ridiculous ive done this hundreds of times youre lying to me i just want my money back at this point i notice something odd on one of the articles of clothing shes trying to return the tag is from a different store gtm maam let me ask you what store are you trying to return your merchandise to gtc what are you talking about gtm where did you buy this stuff gtc names the store surprise it isnt ours gtm maam this is insert name of store here gtc oh she then storms off in a huff because you know its still my fault
i had caught a bad stomach virus one year when i was still a retail drone at a now closed movie store about every min i would throw up and poop myself i will be calling the store manager boss so i called in for my shift hours before the shift since i was working the nd shift that day i called a left a vm for my boss saying i couldnt come in boss called back and left a vm told me i either worked that day or i was fired called pleaded my case no budge seeing as rent was due car payment due and if fired i wouldnt have been able to pay both i was forced to come in after min i had to run to the bathroom to puke and since i had to leave the register to do this my boss wasnt happy and wrote me up for abandoning post told me if it happen again i was going to be let go she put a trash can next to me and said use this if i felt sick so not wanting to live homeless the next month i do i was told after about the th time i dry heaved in to the trash can my face very pale boss came out and told me to go home i was fired i went home and panicked how i will make rent etc the next day the dm called me and ask how i was feeling i told him better than the day before but not he told me ok and asked could he see me tomorrow if i was feeling well nothing else to do i said yes the next day i go in to meet him and my now old boss was there to i was thinking this was an exit interview dm ask me what happen i told him i called in hours before and was told i would be fired if i didnt come in to work boss of course denied it saying i was welcome to take an unpaid day off i then played the vm my exboss left me she was angry after hearing it i was asked to go out the room for a few mins after min i see my exboss walk out the store pissed off tears in her eyes dm calls me in and fills me in it seems that that night when she fired me there was a secret shopper in the line the shopper noted how nice i was despite being obviously too sick to work when the shopper saw me get fired for being too sick to work in front of a line of customer she was outraged and after i left told off the manger and asked for the dm number which the boss refused at first but then gave her the wrong number since she was a secret shopper and knew the correct number to begin with she called the dm that night and told him what went down dm then pull the security tape of that night and confirm the boss handing the trash can and the part about letting me go he told me that he asked my side of the story just for record purposes and i had my job back as well as for my trouble he put days of pto on my paycheck for that week best of yet he made one of the shift leads the new str manger and gave me the shift lead spot which bumped my pay up by bucks and hr at the time 
im a manager at a retail pet supply store i was the manager on duty one evening when i overheard a conversation between a customer and my support manager sm from now on getting a little intense at a cash register the customer was trying to use coupons that she found on some smartphone app that werent valid and sm was explaining why she couldnt accept them theres several fake coupons circulating right now that are badly photoshopped with no expiration date no description of what the sale is for etc the woman was getting in a snit about it so i wandered in that direction in case sm needed assistance i wanted to see how sm would handle the situation so i didnt jump in immediately she was having trouble keeping the woman pacified and in a bit of desperation offered the woman off on her most expensive purchase which was a lb bag of dog food it was within her power to give a discount if she wanted to i dont know if i would have done it but there was nothing wrong with her trying something creative to please a frustrated customer and she had only been frustrated up to this point not rude she honestly didnt know the coupons were forgeries before she came in if you genuinely dont understand something ill be nice and helpful all day long but once you show me you dont value manners my interest in going above and beyond for you evaporates this was the point when the woman decided she wasnt having it shouting that other stores had taken the same coupons before which is probably why we got a bolo report on them and starting to get ugly with sm finally she loudly demanded to see a manager despite sm wearing a name badge that said manager when sm said she that she was one the woman very rudely demanded to see a manager who knew what they were talking about since obviously you dont thats when i stepped around from behind her and introduced myself i let the lady talk and explain her situation in her own words i didnt need my coworker to say anything since we both knew i had heard everything in the end i repeated the same thing to the woman that we couldnt honor the coupons and gave the reasons why she was pissed but i guess since im an sternlooking guy and not a petite young woman like sm she decided that arguing with me wasnt going to get her anything and she gave up she sighed and said fine this is bs but i guess ill just take that off the dog food since you wont take any of your other coupons i hope you know you just lost a lot of business from me me im sorry but i didnt offer you a discount on your dog food woman that girl did jabbing a finger angrily at sm me yes i did hear her do that i also heard you reject her offer because you didnt think she knew what she was talking about you wanted to talk to someone else so now im here and i didnt offer you a discount on anything woman it took a couple seconds for that to sink in her eyes growing wider in rage so youre not going to do anything for me me ill happily check you out thats what i can do for you woman and youre seriously not going to give me a discount for wasting my time me maam you decided to escalate the issue by yelling at my coworker and rejecting her very generous offer to try to make you happy since you wanted a different answer now youre getting one would you like us to check you out now with a couple curse words under her breath she abandoned her purchases and left the store sm thanked me for having her back and then went on break to destress moral of the story be nice to the people you want help from edit gramma an a spellins edit that was by the way not the way i would have coached anyone else to handle it the woman called the store the next day and a different manager took the call i got in a tiny bit of trouble over it but in the end my boss had my back too if she had called our corporate customer support line however i probably could have gotten in much deeper trouble worth it to see the look on her face though

reading some of these reminded me of one of my favorite customers from my past in retail id been working there for well over a year by this point when this happened a guy in a business suit was in my lane looking kind of impatient when he got to me he was incredibly rude towards me even though i was just asking the basic things starting with this rg for rude guy gtme hello how are you today gtrg none of your business that sent up the initial red flag as i figured ok this guy isnt having too good a day gtme alright sir would you like bags today gtrg no im going to carry these all what do you think kid another red flag another smile just to not invoke anything from the dude i didnt even bother mentioning my age cause i sure was not a kid through the rest of his order he is continuing to be increasingly rude toward me to the point i can see hes enjoying himself finally i cant help it and i politely asked him to not speak that way to me since i was just doing my job in ringing him through the response i got still makes me mad to this day gtrg and why should i be nice to you youre the servant and im the customer that makes me better than you so im allowed to treat you like dirt i stopped immediately and just stared at this guy like did you seriously just say that he gave me a smug look which quickly faded when i grabbed the phone and called my manager over i told the manager i was refusing to serve the rude guy and why before i left my lane the manager allowed me to and im pretty sure he gave the rude guy one hell of a lashing for it never saw him back in the store after that and did not care a single bit tldr guy thought treating cashiers like crap was his right just because we are his servants
a few years ago i worked at this little pizza shop a mom and pop place on the main drag in town and it was small enough that on weekdays it would be just me and sometimes another waitress on the floor so one day its just me its late in the afternoon and theres only one family in the restaurant theyre letting their son run around the room while feeding the baby and its not a huge deal since theres only me to botheri would normally ask them to have their child stay with them since we do carry boiling hot cheesy pizza around ive just gone to ask them something do they want dessert or the check etc and im walking away from the table when i realize ive forgotten to ask them another question so i turn around and my swinging hand just smacks their kid right in the face apparently he was running behind me and just happened to be within arms reach i was mortified and the kid grabs his cheek and tears up runs to his mom and puts his face in her lap and cries like i just killed his puppy i thought for sure i was going to get fired they were going to yell and scream and id have to apologize a thousand times and find a new job but then the most amazing thing happens the mom looks me right in the eye winks at me and says to her son gti told you not to run around the restaurant sweetie stop crying and apologize to the nice waitress for being a hooligan im sure your cheek doesnt hurt that much needless to say i was grateful and speechless and i will never forget the day that i smacked someones kid and they didnt yell at me
hi tfr ive been a longtime lurker but i finally decided to make an account and post some stories from my parttime job at an ice cream franchise its my first post so please forgive any formatting mistakes also i apologize in advance for the length bit of background my store isnt a typical ice cream place we dont actually scoop the ice cream for you nor is it selfserve the ice cream or custard or yogurt or whatever actually starts out in liquid form then we freeze it into a solid using liquid nitrogen its a really cool process and most customers especially children love it our story takes place earlier today it was my first day back from a vacation visiting my brother in a different state because he lives very far away and is much older than me we dont get to see each other much anyway while i was visiting him he bought me a very pretty bracelet shaped like a butterfly important i decided to wear that bracelet to work today the day started out normal enough most of the customers were easygoing most of the children that came in were wellbehaved youd be amazed how many kids treat the store like its a playground i thought my shift would go welluntil she came in well call her bitch face bf and her two year old daughter spoiled girl sg i greet bf and go up to the counter to take her order gtme good afternoon maam have you been here before gtbf yes gtme okay great do you know what i can get for you and your daughter gtbf rather curtly we havent decided you dont need to pester me so thats how its gonna be fine bitch gtme putting on the retail smile we all know and love of course take your time let me know when youre ready to order about five minutes later bf calls me over gtbf hello excuse me im ready to order now gtme yes maam what would you like gtbf you know its really ridiculous that i had to wait five minutes for you to take my damn ice cream order really gtme yes maam i apologize for the wait i just wanted to ensure that you had enough time to decide what would you like today gtbf i dont want anything youve ruined my appetite seriously my daughter though wants flavor with topping gtme certainly maam what size would you like gtbf ugh you mean i have to tell you the size you dont just know this went on for a few minutes until bf finally told me the necessary details for her order i mixed the liquid together and proceeded to start freezing it as i began to freeze it sg caught sight of my bracelet gtsg mommy mommy a butterfly i want it gtbf to me where did you get that bracelet i explain to her that my brother gave it to me as a gift and we had purchased from a flea market in his state gtbf well my daughter really likes it and i certainly cant go to state to buy one even if you did go its one of a kindlike many things from flea markets would you give it to her gtme stunned uhim sorry maam this bracelet holds a lot of significance for me it was given to me by my brother and i dont see him very often gtbf yes yes i dont care about that well if youre too selfish to give it to her wat at least let her wear it for a bit im the customer youre required to do what i want ummno first of all ive seen the way your child is acting in the store shes climbing all over the tables knocking shit over behaving like a monkey on speed i dont blame the kid for doing this as she doesnt know better i blame the mother for not supervising her child in a public place im willing to bet that she would break it ten seconds after i give it to her second its my property i can give or refuse to give it to whomever i please third and perhaps most importantly

edit i hate to be this guy but holy crap i never imagined someone would give me gold thanks guys reddit and this sub in particular have helped me through a tough time at the moment thanks so much i have been lurking this subreddit for quite a long time and decided it was finally time to start sharing my stories please excuse any formatting errors be gentle this will be looooonnnggg background i grew up in the pet store business my dad moved us around a lot buying stores that were failing and then turning them around to resell flipping them essentially the last one we stayed in for many years so i have tons of stories growing up in retail led to a steady string of other retail jobs as well so i will have plenty of stories to share this is one of my favorites the most common theme i see in tfr is the longing to be able to tell the shitty customers exactly what you think this made working for my dad a great time my dad is an amazing man minutes talking to him and he would have you writing him a check to purchase your own car from him he could sell anything to anyone he also gave zero fs what anyone thought of him or what he had to say when customers threatened never to come back he would clear their items from the counter and show them to the door he was brutal and truthfully a bit on the crazy side one of the big problems in the pet store business is much of your inventory is alive and people especially children love teasing and poking at the animals this is not only harmful to the animals but also creates a liability risk anyone in the pet store industry will tell you that no amount of danger do not touch signs will stand up against a lawsuit which brings us to our wonderful customer we will call her liar liar or ll her obnoxious young child likely or years old will be called oc i will be me and dad will be dad so late afternoon ll and oc come into our store to browse and likely just kill time or perhaps buy a can of fish food from the time they enter ll has zero idea where oc is and what he is doing this kid is out of control knocking things off of shelves running just a little asshole meanwhile ll is oblivious and browsing our store was decent sized for an independent pet store and we had the best fish room in the state built by myself shameless plug but hey i am still proud after all these years so ll is off in the fish room while oc makes his way to the exotic birds section another of our specialties there were many very sweet and very expensive birds there and we were quite protective of them oc is being very loud yelling at the birds etc i come by and catch him poking at a very sweet amazon parrot that we had purchased from a family who could not keep her very recently and she was still acclimating this bird was sweet and talked like crazy this was the only time i heard her scream i took a play straight from dads playbook and asked oc where his parents were he said he didnt know so i led him to the front counter and instructed him to stay there with an employee while i located his mother when i found his mother i explained to her what had happened and that he was no longer allowed to roam our store unattended as he was a danger to himself and our animals she storms to the front grabs her child and leaves in a huff i should mention here that the conversation with ll took place in the fish room directly on the other side was dads office and the tops are open not full walls a couple of hours later ll calls and asks to speak to the owner call gets transferred to dad and happened as follows ll i was in your store with my son and your employee was very rude to both of us he said terrible things about my son swore at him and me grabbed my son by the arm and threw us both out of your store i want him fired i was prepared to spend a gajillion dollars at your store dad i am very sorry to hear that please give me some time to get to the bottom of it and give me a call back tomorrow what ll didnt know was that dad had witnessed ocs behavior saw me escort him to the counter and then retreated to his office where he heard our entire interaction next day ll calls back for dad ll i called yesterday and i want to know if that employee has been fired i will call the bbb blah blah blah dad well i was gonna deal with this while on the phone with you yesterday but i thought a day for you to come to your senses may have helped you i see that it didnt i saw your child destroying my store and my property i saw him terrorizing my animals i saw the employee my son lead him to the counter and speak with him respectfully i saw you ignoring your child while he destroyed my property and further i heard the entire exchange between my employeeson and yourself so i thought about firing him but then i realized that you and your child are both assholes and i would prefer you never enter my store again thank you for the customer feedback fuck off click my dad was the best if you want to hear more i would be glad to post more maybe next will be the time that he chased a customer out to his car edit when dad chased a customer to his car edit i am so glad you guys love this story i have so many more and it makes me feel so good to remember him this way yet to come directing traffic in a busy intersection just to see if people would do what he said mashed potatoes in an employees ear while they were speaking to a customer seriously he never quit if i could only learn to live like he did last edit i have gotten a few comments about how extreme my dads behavior was i just want to say that i agree it was extreme and he was out of his effin mind but what made him great was that he said what he felt and did what he chose he never let others opinions of him affect him not once he lived life on his his terms and did the things most of us wish we could do he went where he wanted he took chances at years old and playing it safe my entire adult life i am now trying to learn to live as he did he is the most amazing and strongest person i have ever known some of his antics sound crazy as his only child i am here to tell you that they were all far beyond crazy but he lived life 
i work produce in a higher end grocery store the following took place on a weekday afternoon a few weeks ago i was stocking something when a middle aged lady in glasses called me over not obnoxiously just sort of caught my attention and raised her fingers next to her head smiling all the time i asked if i could help her yes are these apples organic she asks the sign says so yup theyre organic i point to the sign she scrunches up her face and shakes her head a little but theyre from chile yeah organic apples from chile its the off season for apples so thats where were getting this variety of organic apple from she screws her face up further long pause but theyre from chile not sure what she wants here yeah organic apples from chile thats where we get this variety of organic apple from this time of year how can they be organic if they are from chile she asks next the orchard would have to be certified to grow organic apples and that certification would have to be approved by the usda or else they couldnt sell them as organic in the us i say she shakes her head again see you dont know about those other countries they could just say that these are organic they cant be imported and sold as organic unless they meet usda organic requirements looking to just end this i offer let me go get the box for you i run into the back and grab a box top from the back stock same variety same orchard has all the information including a prominent usda certified organic label she inspects the box but how do i know i can trust the usda well its the government agency that certifies all organically labeled produce for sale in the us the government like i should trust the government these are from chile she hands me the box top back im not entirely sure what she wants from me here this all just seems kinda screwy dont you think she says leaning in conspiratorially at this point ive dropped retail politeness no i dont think so another long pause as she stares at me i mean you know how those people are you cant trust them why would that be i asked you know its just in their nature toyou know shes acting like were good pals sharing a joke no i dont know she stares at me for another long awkward moment she then laughs some like shes trying to cover up her last statement she then just sort of shuffled off 
yesterday i was on the phone when this a year old comes toddling up to the counter she waited patiently for me to finish and then asked mumble mumble eeeeeeeeeeeeeee bar bar i looked at her mother for help she wants to know if you have any berenstain bears books i said oh i think so lets go look i came around the counter and she grabbed my hand adorable the kid was wearing a pink hello kitty shirt camouflage pants and pink sequined hello kitty shoes i told her i admired her fashion sense we hunkered down in the kids books to hunt out the elusive berenstain bears books i sell used and new books and the kids section defies organization i try to keep everything corralled but if i leave it for an hour it devolves into chaos so i told the little girl to look with me and we made kind of a game out of it we found her books plus a few extra and chatted pleasantly about kitty shoes and dora the explorer and how bears are experts at camping when kids are awesome or at least not ravening hellspawn i generally give them stickers i had been cleaning out the back room and found the treasure box that was left over from a pirate promotion we did its full of cheap toys candy and for some reason packages of cheese balls i let her pick something out from the treasure box and she went right for the cheese balls cheese balls she exclaimed i said that sounds like a battle cry cheese balls and i punched my fist into the air so she punches her little fist in the air and yells cheese balls then she runs down the aisle bellowing cheese balls later her mom left me a message on facebook saying that while her daughter always loved reading she had never had as much fun picking out books before she had pronounced our bookstore the best one ever and had been yelling cheese balls after she finished each book i love my job
i just recently started posting and realized how many crazy things have happened to me in all the years ive worked in retail ive gotten good responses on my stories so far yall are awesome on to the story i was working for a well known cell phone company as a sales tech in a rich white neighborhood a lot of these ladies are mean as fire and their children are just as bad sometimes worse this kid was worse her mother even though she had a expensive looking manicure and salon style blonde hair looked threadbare the little girl who was about or immediately caused a scene in my store my other coworker was out to lunch so i received no back up against the little monster little girl lg mom m me me lg i want this one i want this one pointing to the most high end phone we have that just came on the market the week before m honey why dont we start you out with an older model to see how you do with it you already have an ipod and a tablet lg reaching an octave that could potentially shatter glass i want this one m sighing and turning to me can we get expensive phone on blah account i go in the back to grab the device out of inventory me we have gold silver lg still screaming gold i want gold i start the process of putting the phone onto the account and setting up the device me to the mother she refused to put insurance on the device for some insane reason well i highly recommend a case these phones can be easily broken lg no i want everyone to see its gold me to the mother we have clear cases lg no the mother tried to convince her daughter to no avail to put a case on the phone but eventually gives up i finish the sale and the little girl starts jumping around the store with her new phone her mother tiredly says goodbye and they walk out of the store right as they get outside the little girl swings herself in a circle and the phone goes flying out of her hands straight into the concrete both of them freeze and turn ashen then the little girl starts to scream the mother looks back at me with wide eyes and i just shrug the phone was completely shattered the screen still worked but they had to make a trip to the repair store so the mom could pay another hundred something dollars to have the screen replaced im sure the kid screamed the entire way 
i work at a gas station and because its family owned and im the son of the owner i get to have a lot of leeway with giving customers discounts and i like to help people out a bit and i use that leeway a lot anyway a woman comes in today and buys packs of cigarettes a king size candy bar a ounce coke so i give her the three pack deal price on the cigarettes and instead of the candy and drink being each i just give it to her for even making the total even well when i tell her the total she says thats not right thats way too much so i tell her how i did it i tell her i charged for each pack of cigarettes and each for the pop and candy she however is still adamantly refusing to believe that that is the correct price she asks to see my manager well i pretty much am the manager and i dont feel like dealing with this so instead i tell her you know what youre right i charged you the wrong price so i recalculate the total to and i tell her i had given her a discount originally she realized her mistake and asked for the lower price i told her if she doesnt like this price then shell have to go somewhere else even with the nondiscounted price were still cheaper than the gas stations around us she sulked and paid for her stuff without saying a word thats a victory in my books
i was working the register one day when a customer comes up and everything about him tells me he is one angry customer one i wont be meeting again or so i thought hes pretty much huffing and puffing before i even say hi and something tells me ill know why in about seconds our store is very focused on customer satisfaction and well do just about anything to get them happy so i put on a smile and greet him me hi did you get an ordernumber from one of my colleauges him this is outrageous i shouldnt have to bring the price for the item im buying this is unacceptable me as im taking the paper with his order from his handim sorry what happened him his raised voice now gathering some interest from other customers i visited your website and the price there is less than here in the store me im very sorry we probably havent changed the pricetag yet but the price of your order is the same as online him that doesnt matter its fraud me but the price for the product youre buying is the same as the online price and if it hadnt been wed be more than happy to match that price im sorry for any inconvenience but this is the same price that you saw online him thats not the point it was more expensive you should tell your manager you are committing fraud me my patience wearing thin sir i am the manager and we will always match any price you find online including prices from competitors but sometimes we have special deals online we do not claim to always have the same price online as we do in out store but if you as a customer find the same product anywhere else and tell us we are more than happy to give you that price as a thank you for giving us your business if we did promise to have the exact same price in our stores as we do online but didnt that would be breaking marketing laws but it would not be considered fraudulent i used to study law and usually i would just smile and nod but as he was now screaming and a line was forming so i had a vain hope that he would calm down if i spoke to him him not fraudulent are you serious i am a lawyer i have driven here all the way from my house in affluent area of town and dont you think i know what fraud is you have no right to tell me i am wrong and i will go to the papers with your fraud after this i just gave up he was on his way out the door still screaming about our fraud and i took a deep breath and turned to my next customer fast forward months im long overdue to meet my sos family and as weve moved in together its about time im nervous as hell cause ill meet them all at once and i dont know anyone there but as it turns out ive met my sos grandfather before

i work parttime as a cashier at a grocery store i enjoy my job because i get to meet so many different people and learn about cooking and food subjects i know very little about that said you guys know what the pay is like happiness doesnt pay the rent yesterday i checked my bank account and saw that i have to make stretch another week til payday i turn next week and this is my life my customers ask me if im in school which is a fair question but i got both a college degree and a trade school certification years ago im embarrassed that my peers are climbing the ladder at their companies and im sacking groceries wearing an oversized polo shirt yesterday was a tough day and i felt really depressed when i clocked in but a french woman and her wonderful daughter turned it all around a mom and her year old daughter approached my counter with an overflowing cart and the mom pulled out a collection of huge reusable bags mom stationed herself next to me behind the counter ready to bag her groceries and the little girl said i want to scan and reached into the cart and started scanning bar codes like a pro my first thought was oh no shes going to mess something up but my coworker and i both helped her by handing her items with bar codes and passed them to her mother who filled up her bags and we had a little assembly line going it was fun when we got to the fruits and vegetables that must be weighed i took over because i thought she couldnt do it but then i remembered that she was born into a world with iphones and this wouldnt be hard for her so i invited her back around and showed her how to find the plu numbers and type them in and she just had the time of her life standing on her tip toes ringing up produce finally she rang up the last item and i showed her how to tear the receipt which she proudly handed to her mom across the counter an older man was next in line and i was afraid he would complain about the extra wait time instead he said gtthat was fun you know what that mom was teaching her daughter she was teaching her that all work is honorable no matter what it is sometimes i need to be reminded too 
 last night i got to witness some great stupidity in action as i was going to take my break security flew past me and stopped some woman at the door she made a huge scene but they took her off to the back and called the cops as i was coming back from break the police show up i of course returned to work i was not getting involved with the situation about minutes pass and a woman walks up to me and asks if she could speak to a manager i call a manager and they come out to talk to her turns out the shop lifter was a year old girl stealing makeup the woman was her mom who was contacted by police to get her daughter who was just given a no trespass order and a citation to appear in court the day passed on without anything out of the ordinary towards the end of my shift i was talking to one of our security and said i saw them bust the girl earlier that day he then tells me it got better than that and he told me the story the mother was taken to the back of the store by the manager and the police were still processing the girl they busted the mother was asked to wait and told it would be to minutes while they did the paperwork the mother asked if she could get a few things and was told it was ok the mother is walked back to the sales floor and shops around while shopping she was being followed by another security worker the woman grabbed some groceries and went by our hair care section and got a brush and a dollar hair dryer she then proceeded to unbox the hairdryer and shove it in her purse security stopped her there and took her to the back the police did not appreciate the extra work and apparently the mother was busted before stealing at a different store so they decided to arrest her outright the father was contacted and he came in to get his daughter the father was pissed off and had asked the cops for a copy of both the citations the dad was going to use it to his advantage to get custody of the daughter the mother apparently was caught stealing so many times the father divorced her for it i was told the dad was on the phone with his lawyer about getting full custody while he was taking his daughter out of the store one hell of a day for security 
my story requires a little bit of a prelude to know how things work in the restaurant i work at i work at a mongolian grill all you can eat buffet there is a huge buffet of raw vegetables means and sauces you throw what you want in a bowl and bring it up to the grill we fit about meals on the grill at a time and everyone stands in line waiting for their meal to be cooked when it is almost done we go to the first meal on the grill and offer teriyaki to the first person in line and then the second and so on fairly regularly people decide not to stand in line and then fail to correct us if we are pointing at a meal that doesnt belong to them and ask if they want teriyaki on said meal so mistakes happen enter megabitch mb is here with her family all their meals are on the grill but she does not stay in order but switches with her son her son wants teriyaki she does not but being switched she gets it she points out the mistake and the cook fortunately i was not cooking at this time while normally i would be apologizes profusely and offers her another bowl she refuses the bowl and proceeds to curse about what a fucking moron he is doing so loudly so the whole restaurant can hear she refuses to eat although her family sits down to eat she complains loudly the entire meal when they go to pay she complains to the hostess and she offered to comp their drinks the woman demanded that their food be free because of the terrible service they received the hostess tells her the cook offered you another bowl they tried to fix the problem no one treated you horribly the woman retorts something like im going to get online and write a terrible review of this place the hostess smiles at her and says good you do that probably holding back laughter at the woman by this point and then out of nowhere and right over her son she punched the hostess square in the face then her and her family left one of the waitresses ran outside and got the license plate number not only that they paid with a groupon so it was easy to track her down the police arrested her and the hostess pressed charges whats really great is that a few months before that hostess had been in a car accident that fucked up her neck and it wasnt healed yet that punch which normally one could take quite well sent her physical therapy back to stage which made it count as a new injury which made that womans punch assault and that punch being thrown over her child counted as child endangerment the best part she was a special needs teacher and with a felony charge you cant work with kids so as a result she also lost her job im shocked anyone could be that aggressive more so that such a person worked with kids but i am extremely happy her life is completely fucked up now edit i meant it became a felony not that it became an assault my bad
i worked at a furniture store but instead of selling furniture i worked at the restaurant in the front a little context we have a thing called the family card which is basically a loyaltyrewards card when you get a new family card you get one free frozen yogurt an ice cream at the restaurant at the front where i worked to get this card you just need to type at least your name dob and email at an automated vending machine it is not checked so you can just come here and make one with a fake name and email and choose a dob that is over so one day a mom arrives with three kids she will be smartass sa and i will be me gt me hi how are you toda gt sa three frozen yogurts please well at least she said please gt me okay that will be gt sa hands me three of the coupons that come with the cards gt sa do i still need to pay tax on these gt me looking at the timestamp on the coupons they were just made that day a few minutes apart from each other they couldnt be for her kids the terms amp conditions clearly say anyone over the age of can join storename family bitch two can play at this game gt me who do these cards belong to gt sa umm that ones mine and the other two belong to my friends gt me these were made a few minutes ago are your friends still here gt sa i uhh i can i see your manager gt me i am the manager gt sa fine hands me a credit card c for effort
when i was younger i worked in a pet shoppe for about years this was an on and off again position based on both the stores and my need for work while i was there a young homeless gentlemen named daniel started coming in to the pet shoppe to get food for his pup it was an adorable teenage german shepherd girl who was way too friendly and derpy the guy was really kind and that store has always catered to the poor or down trodden more then any other store i know of my boss the owner was a former drug addict and so she always hired people who just needed to work and did her best to take care of her home community through the store she gave him a collar leash and some food for the pup in thanks he started coming in and cleaning every once and a while and she reciprocated by buying him lunch more like a massive meal each time this became a regular thing the owner then started ordering good quality but cheap pet food and charging homeless people only the cost of ordering it same for collars and leashes then she started a drive for people to donate to cover the cost of those items so someone in need could come in and get their pet something to eat daniel continued to come in and clean after a few months we had a drive to donate blankets and coats to the homeless with the promise of off their order if they brought in something as long as it wasnt garbage basically other pet stores started doing this too just to maintain foot traffic and still daniel continued to clean within a year every pet store in town had homeless drives or free supplies to pets of homeless people the local vet started offering free puppy shots to the homeless since we had started doing that as well as everything else this was all because of daniel was just trying to earn a decent meal and take care of his pup one day a homeless man came in really young and honestly likely still high he asked to speak with the owner this was common and so my boss comes down all he said was that daniel was dead he was gone this kind young man who was on a downside but was working to improve his life he overdosed the night before sure enough the derpy german shepherd pup was sitting outside she was now much too large for the store just kind of sadly staring at the blank wall across the street the guy asked for a sandwich not understanding how daniel had worked for a meal but just assumed that the boss gave them out but the boss gave him her own food and went back inside with the shepard pup the guy didnt want the dog so my boss took her home years later the town is now in the process of building a safe homeless park just a sheltered place to sleep but its specifically designed to help people stay dry and warm on wet nights this town went from antihomeless to support for the homeless in a little over a year though the park is very new and all this happened years ago all because of daniel i just hope that he knows what an impact he made wherever he is update thank you to the person who gave me gold because they thought it was a true golden tale ive never received gold but it was touching to find it so thank you especially because i didnt earn it but because daniel did i will be xposting this to rhomeless shortly as was recommended but please give me time to do so im really grateful for all the positive feedback my boyfriend yelled at me when i was posting this in the morning because i took so long however that was only because today we were moving and i was in bed on reddit an hour after i was supposed to be ready he then apologized after i just opened this to over upvotes while at dinner after we finished moving for the day he laughed and i clapped and im sure the other customers in the americanchinese restaurant thought we were crazy the usual

alright time for update for those just joining in on this clusterfuck is the first post and is the second post so basically big things happened today and i will try to explain them in as much detail as possible i woke up bright and early and made a call to corporate my plan here was simply to state that i needed my issue investigated further even if it seemed like there was no problem on their end as expected the person on the other end of the phone told me the same thing that they had already told me the first time i had called but then i said the magic word subpoena as soon as i made the calm yet firm threat the person immediately told me to hold on for a second he got his supervisor on the line to whom i explained my situation once again and he assured me that he would see into the matter oh and i also asked for a way to email the president of the company and i sent an email to him explaining my situation as well so that was that but i didnt stop there see i had another plan i was going to catch my manager myself redhanded you know just in case corporate dun goofs so i walk into work and i immediately go into the managers office i stand in front of him and the conversation goes like this me i have to speak with you about something really important manager can it wait i need to finish looking over these documents before me no it cant wait supervisors name told me that my clock in and clock out time from lunch days ago was not on the log i know i punched out and in so what happened manager huh weird ill look into it for ya alright me oh no need i already called corporate and they said theyd look into it personally at this point i had the widest shiteating grin i have ever had in my life it felt good man real fucking good the manager audibly gulps at this point no doubt shitting bricks manager you know that wasnt really necessary you could have come to me about this first me oh i know but i just didnt want to waste your time seeing as how youre always busy and all you have more important things to do like look over documents at this point he visibly begins to get annoyed by my attitude and my sarcastic tone but im just enjoying it way too much manager now listen tomatoketchup im not really liking your tone right now me i apologize anyways i just wanted to give you a heads up in case corporate asks you any questions you know how they are at this point some of you might be thinking why i said that last part why because i had a small suspicion that since he is a recentlymade manager months now he probably didnt know that the system logs all deletions and reentries sure you would be told this if you become manager but i was trying my luck at this point because a i dont see who else could have deleted my log times and b if it was him who deleted them he obviously didnt know about the fact that the deletions are tracked so what was my endgame here simple i was hoping that due to this threat about corporate he would simply go back and add my times back onto the log and guess what he did just that a couple of minutes after our conversation he comes up to me and tells me manager tomatoketchup i found out what the problem was there was a glitch in the system and apparently it didnt register your punches but everything is fixed now your log times should be there now me wow thanks i appreciate it manager no problem but wait a minute theres more just a couple of hours into my shift i see the manager leaving the store angrily slamming the manager offices door on his way out when i asked my supervisor buddy what had happened the conversation went like this me dude why is he so angry supervisor i dont know he was with corporate on the phone for a few minutes and then he asked me why i told you that the time logs were missing hold up let me find out so my supervisor runs out the front doors to catch up with my manager they talk for a while outside after which my manager gets into his car and angrily drives off then my supervisor comes back inside walks up to me and says supervisor dude im sorry to tell you this but hes fucked corporate found evidence of data tampering in the punchin log apparently he deleted your times yesterday and added them back today this morning to cover his ass me wow supervisor yep me how didnt he know about the systems ability to track that stuff supervisor i dont know man so theres that he will probably get fired and i will probably well keep my job i could not have done with without you guys or your support and i certainly could not have come up with half of the ideas or thought processes that got me out of this hole and for those of you saying that i should have just let it be instead of causing more problems no that is not how you do things when someone is trying to fuck with your life thanks again for all your support i hope i have more stories to share with you all in the near future hopefully customerrelated and not jobthreatening tomatoketchup signing off peace edit wow thanks for the gold totally unexpected

in another post i was asked about stories from my stint at an adult store this is probably my single most favorite it was a normal morning a few rental customers but otherwise not much activity yet my coworker and i were rather bored as all our cleaning and organizing had been completed pretty sure we were talking about the new pirates fleshlights that had came in a few days prior the door jingles and in walk a couple the man was not hesitant at all about walking in however the woman was she was partially hiding behind his back nervously glancing around like she thought a dildo was going to jump out at her when she saw my coworker and i both women behind the counter she seemed to relax a bit her boyfriend grabbed her hand and dragged her over to the high priced toy cabinet and started talking to her about what he wanted to get her my coworker and i stopped paying much attention at that point as he obviously had been in before and knew to ask for help she was nervous but it got much worse as he then started to go farther into the store while the high priced toys are up front the farther you go backthe more exotic the toys get while you start with the cutesie almost novelty vibrators it ends in items like the american challenge and a full hand and fist next to those was the bdsm toys she started muttering that she really shouldnt be in there when they started at the vibrator wall it got louder and interlaced with im a good catholic girl this is wrong not the first time this has been said in the store so i dont pay it much attention what i didnt expect was when she reached the american challenge its giant its purple and can be quite a shock it has never however pushed someone to hysterics she started panicking and crying and fanning her face why would someone do that that is so wrong they need to find jesus then she saw the fist and cried even harder she started backing up out of the section swearing at her boyfriend for bringing her in there then she saw the little glass case that we knew would get us a little flack but it was worth it this company makes silicone molded toys no vibrating but very high quality the subject matter the baby jesus a plug the virgin mary the devil ect there was even a model of the bible you could use if you were a guy toscrew she screamed pointing at the case and very quickly decided to get mad at us you are going to hell for this how dare you use them like that im reporting you totosomeone she ran out of the store with her boyfriend almost on the floor laughing he knew exactly how she was going to react and did it anyway we also started laughing after he left what did she expect we will never know tldr a woman finds jesus in an adult store decides not to screw herself with him edit two gold damn you guys really do like dildos

could have been english it could have been curses in the tongue of the first men of the world it could have been cains final words to abel but i do know that it echoed in the stillness of the parking

i used to work for a chain of video game stores that takes tradeins on a regular basis we offered cash for games at a reduced rate but could only give cash to people over i believe it had something to do with pawn laws that we had to follow anyway a kid who im guessing was between and years old comes in with his older brother one day hes got a stack of games in his hands some of them brand new and informs me that he plans on trading them in i ask him to head over to the counter and proceed to check over the games a few of them are scratched to what i would consider to be beyond repair but were still within the guidelines that allow me to accept them as trade after i finish i tell him that he can go ahead and look around and ill have his transaction waiting for him when hes done after a couple minutes he comes up to the counter and says he wants cash for the games i was familiar with this young man and was pretty sure he wasnt over but i asked him for his id anyway as i suspected he was underage gtme i cant give you cash for your games as youre under but i can give you store credit if you like you can use it later when you find a game you want he turns and looks at his brother and then agrees i swipe an empty gift card through the register and he walks away with something like or bucks in store credit he leaves with his brother and i move on with my day less than an hour later he comes back in and is pretty mad hes saying his card didnt work my first thought is that he went to the other store in our chain that happened to be less than minutes away so i ask him gtme did you try it at the ourotherlocation down the street gtcustomer no i was at bigboxretailernextdoor gtme i almost facepalmed the worst part was it took me about minutes to explain to him why he couldnt use his store credit for our store at a different store tldr kid didnt understand that store credit didnt mean any store edit clarification 
when i was i worked as a salesman in an electronics retailer pretty fun job i usually enjoyed interacting with the customers usually this was not one of those times i was helping a couple that were after a new tvhomecinema system they bought the stuff left and that was that entirely uneventful but then it happened they returned the man told us his wife had lost her bag and since this was the only place theyd been it was clearly here we checked the area id been talking to them and nothing there then i checked the lost amp found nothing there nobody had handed anything in bugger after hunting around the rest of the store failed to turn up anything the manager told the customer that it didnt seem to be here but wed keep an eye out and contact him if it turned up he thanked us and left not minutes later his wife stormed up to the manager and entered into a tirade about how shed definitely left the bag here wed obviously stolen it she was going to call the police etc she then stormed back out of the store and my manager disappeared into the offices at the back of the store a couple of hours later shed followed through on her threat and contacted the police she came in with a pcso and asked for the manager my manager came out with a huge smile on his face it turns out hed disappeared into the back rooms to hunt through the cctv footage and he gleefully showed the officer the footage of this woman walking out of the store with her bag and another shot from the car park of her getting into her car still with the bag never have i seen a man with such a look of glee on his face before or since it was fantastic we later found out that they found the bag under the seat in the carshe never did apologise
it all started one afternoon when i went to a large blue tech chain with one of my friends to help him pick out a new cheap laptop we walked over to the computers looked over a handful of them he asked me some questions about differences in processors and memory then meandered off to go grab some games he also wanted i hung around and was looking playing with the tablets they had on display when an older woman approached me gtwoman excuse me can you help me with something gtme uh sure i guess what do you need gtwoman i need you to price match this computer with amazon gtme oh im sorry i dont work here youll need to talk to one of the employees for that gtwoman what do you mean you were helping that other man just a minute ago gtme hes one of my friends and im helping him pick out a new laptop but i cant help you with price matching or anything like that gtwoman well fine if you dont want to help me ill just find someone who does she goes over to an actual employee and starts talking to them and i think to myself well that was weird and move on my friend comes back over and we start trying to decide between two laptops when i suddenly hear her return gtwoman thats him he refused to help me i turn around to find her standing there with a manager gtmanager maam hes not an employee here he cant help you with anything gtwoman but hes helping that man right there pointing at my friend gtme like i said before im just helping my friend here pick out a new laptop i am not an employee gtwoman i just wanted to price match this is that so hard to do gtmanager i understand maam and i can take care of that for you over at customer service he pointed her over towards the counter and she walked away with a huff mumbling something about some people just dont know their place gtmanager im sorry about this sir she made it sound like you were one of our employees but clearly you are just here with your friend sorry about that gtme no problem have fun with that my friend and i promptly chose a laptop and got out of there only to find out we had also parked right next to her just as i thought we had escaped she started at me again gtwoman how dare to you lie to your manager like that you work here and i know it ive seen you here before gtme listen lady i dont give a shit what you think anymore i dont work here ive never worked here im not wearing the blue shirt with the name tag and the big fucking logo so fuck off i got in the car and she started yelling at me through the window spewing the usual how dare you talk to me like that and i am your elder crap tried to block my friend from getting into the passenger side he just got in the back on the driver side and even stood behind my car to prevent me backing up as luck would have it the person who had been parked in front of me had left at some point while we were inside so i just went for the pull through as we circled around towards the exit she glared at me with all her might and i just gave a big grin and a middle finger tldr crazy bitch thought i was an employee and tried to get me in trouble
okay so once in a while i read a story here about some poor bystander getting mistsken for an employee of a store then promptly chewed out for not performing their notjob satisfactorily today was my turn i work for an event oriented business that operates out of an old house down the street from a big chain store that specializes in hardware that is used in the home given the age of the house and the size of it employees in uniform carry walkietalkies with them and we all wear black now i dont know what possessed this woman to approach someone dressed in only black with a radio on their hip but this lady was pissed she storms through the aisle as i was looking for a piece of tubing to replace something in a drink dispenser down at the house we usually got sent on errands during slow nights and starts waving a receipt in my face saying im here to return this okay no problem she just thought i was a manager or something i tell her that i dont actually work there and she pretty much loses it starts going on about how im avoiding dealing with her so the company can keep her money at this point im a little bit rattled never been mistaken for an employee like this before so i quickly told her i would find somebody to help her out repeating that i dont actually work there thats when it happened hey cielavocyr can i get you down to aisle xx real quick shit one of my coworkers decided to radio me at the worst possible time as they were having trouble finding something in another aisle and wanted my help the woman flips saying that i am clearly lying to her about not working there and that lying is a crime that can get me arrested then thank god a manager walks by and sees the commotion carrying none other than a very similar radio on his hip he explains that i dont actually work there and that she shouldnt be so accusatory of peoples intentions my hero then he deals with the return taking the receipt to check it out before walking over to returns and as i walk away i hear the faintest indiciation that the receipt was not in fact even from this store retail is strange you guys are heroes 
okay so a friend of mine suggested i share this story and i think its probably the best i have after working in retail for years a few years ago i worked in a mall for a well known novelty store that also sold adult type merchandise one day i was alone on the floor as my manager was in the backroom getting ready to leave this somewhat normal looking guy walks in i greet and him he pretty much ignored meas per usual and he continued to browse he eventually came up to the register put some stuff onto the counter and i smiled and began to ring up his purchase i asked him if that was all he needed for today and he gave me this strange look and proceeded to point out that our store has too much profanity at this time i finally realized that all of the merch he had collected had at least some form of fuck on it thinking he was just the typical shocked old man who had never been in this store before i apologized and really didnt expect what happened next crazy guy this is against the law you cant sell these things kids can see it me sir there are warnings on the entrance of our store and we are allowed to sell these products or else the mall would not let us be here cg im calling the police yes he pulled out his cell phone and called the state troopers right there in front of me now my manager had just emerged from the back and had caught some of the conversation as the guy was reporting us to the police my manager went out into the mall and grabbed a security guard meanwhile im standing there completely shocked and amused wondering what this guy is going to do when the cops tell him they cant shut us down cgstill on the phone with the cops they said i can politely ask you to stop selling these products by now mall security arrived and escorted him out of the store he the guard and my manager stood just outside the front window as the guard tried to explain to this man that he cannot do anything and if he insisted to harass us he would be kicked out the man begrudgingly agreed but stood on the opposite side of the hall glaring at our store for a good minutes before finally leaving oh it doesnt end there the next morning i had the opening shift and guess who showed up i immediately recongnized him and decided against confronting him unless he got hostile i watched him approach a bunch of tshirts grab them and promptly turn them over he left soon after but i still called security just in case just as the guard arrived the guy came back with the mall manager i had to honestly hold back my laughter as this guy pleaded his case to the mall manager props to the mall manager who listened patiently and then told the guy the same thing along with if you do not like the products they sell then do not come in here after that i never saw him again
lurker on phone long time retail slave some background my father is a cpa who runs a small shop in the front of the office for extra income he has no employees for the shop other then my sister and me when we were younger so i was my birthday and my dad was gong to take me to lunch as we were getting ready to head out a tax client came by and needed his taxes done now i know this wont take more then a hour so i say no problem i will just run the shop to stay out of the way and we will get lunch after he is done now the fun part i am in the front reading a book when in walks a customer i put the book down and ask if i can help with anything lady brushes me off so i go back to my novel when she is done she comes to the front and i start ringing her purchases she also wants two money orders for each so i ring them in and give her her total she pulls out a checkbook and asks for a pen i inform her that money orders are cash only and give her the pen and her total for her items minus the money orders and the fees associated with them she looks at me like she just realized i was the shit she stepped in on the way to work and says your new here but the owner lets me write checks for money orders and gives me a discount on all purchases i say thats fine she is more then welcome to come back when the owner is working she instantly loses her shit and starts berating me my looks and anything she thinks i might like i just sat there thinking no good deed when she realized i wasnt reacting she started throwing the packets of gum next to to register at me so my dad hears the commotion and sticks his head out the door that connects the back offices to the front and sees this women throwing gum at me while i am dodging them laughing and telling her to calm down now when i said my dad is a cpa you probably envisioned a small balding man wearing a bad suit change that image to a large hairy biker that loves math now you have a better idea of what he looks like he quite calmly asks my name is there a problem hearing the owner this woman turns mid throw and says the only problem here is that this bitch you hired wont do her job that is when i got the best present a retail worker could ask for my dad responds that bitch is my daughter and its her birthday get the fk out of my store and if i ever see you again here or even out on the street i am going to show you exactly how mad i am right now run and she did she dropped every thing is her hands and hightailed it out of the store my dad canceled the rest of his appointment which the client readily agreed to and we went for a wonderful lunch 
when the fourth book of the harry potter series came out there was a printers error in some of the us editions a couple text blocks were identical so parts of some chapters were repeated we had some very angry people coming in for exchanges but we were ready we just swapped em out and were as cheerful as possible ho ho the printer must have been drunk on butter beer such wags we were one lady came in furious though because her entire book was printed upside down she angrily slid the book over for me to examine the poor quality standards in american manufacturing i looked at the book took the dust jacket off turned the book around put the dust jacket back on and said flippicus jacketus she looked at me with such rage and then dawn broke she realized what she had done and started laughing which is good because my boss at the time was not as nice as delores umbridge
background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square foot of fireworks heaven two years ago a woman stopped in to get some stuff to give to her kids as christmas presents she had two boys amp and wanted me to help her pick out some stuff i showed her some of the smaller things but she actually ended up buying a big mortar kit for the kids figuring that she could help them light them off and it would be more impressive a few days after christmas she came back and told me this story it was just her and the kids and they had had a great christmas she thought her younger son would be excited by the fireworks so shed let him open it but after he had ripped off the wrapping paper and seen what it was he didnt really say anything about it she was sitting across the room from him and asked him what the present was that santa had gotten him he mumbled something and set the box aside she was a little disappointed that he wasnt more excited but she didnt say anything and they continued ripping open gifts later that morning after the gift hurricane had died down she decided to ask him about the fireworks and went to grab the box she couldnt find it in the pile of presents and she didnt see it in his room its a good sized box about ft tall and inches wide so it shouldnt have been hard to spot she asks her son about the big box that santa had gotten him and he just shrugged his shoulders it turns out he had hidden the box under his bed when hed opened the present he had quickly reasoned that if his mom found out that santa had given him a big box of fireworks she would take them away he had played it cool and hidden the box when she wasnt looking truly a child after my own heart

i work as a cashier in the lumber department of a home improvement store today a lady and her son who was probably about three years old came in to get some various pieces of lumber as they were ringing out i noticed a light brown praying mantis just hanging out on one of the pieces of wood i jokingly said to the mom is that praying mantis yours she laughed and said its been sitting there since they came in the little boy seemed very interested in it bending down just to observe it when i was finished ringing everything up and the mom was about to slide her card the boy yelled wait i want to get something probably thinking he wanted a candy bar or something his mom waited to pay instead of picking out some candy or a drink like most kids do the boy gently picked up the praying mantis and brought it to my counter he placed it down ever so carefully and asked me can i please buy this hes really cool i looked at his mom and she nodded so i turned to the little boy and said you can take him home and i wont even make you pay for him because i can tell he likes you the kids face lit up and he just kept thanking me the whole interaction brightened my day a little because not only was the boy very polite but it also reminded me of the wonder and excitement of being a little kid and finding a cool new bug

i had no idea my original post about my dad would blow up like it did in hindsight after all of my years in retail and all of the stories i have read on tfr i realize that he was the hero we all wanted haha so here is the story of when he chased a customer out to his car original post is here so to start a little more history about my dad he was a gay man who raised me on his own he moved us around the country while he bought failing pet stores and quickly made them profitable to resell and move on to the next one he was crazy and didnt care what anyone thought he always said the customer is always right is bullshit the truth is the customer is always the customer and there are more where they came from he was a legend in the industry he was also an award winning dog groomer and handler for show dogs to several celebrities that brings stories of its own he seriously gave zero fucks i will likely make a post soon just detailing the intricacies of my crazy retail genius dad but for now the customer he chased to his car so a surprisingly large amount of profit from our pet store came from the sale of live feeders rodents per week crickets per week and goldfish per week this story involves feeder goldfish used to feed larger fish and small aquatic snakes and other reptiles it should be noted that when our shipments of these feeder animals arrived we would typically sell out within a few days and would have to wait until next weeks shipment as an exotic pet store this was big business we had this one guy who came in every single week to buy worth of feeder goldfish we sold them at for this guy was a complete asshole every week he treated our employees like garbage and like his slaves he complained about everything how they were collected how they were bagged that the way they were poured into the bag would bruise them drove a very expensive car and just thought we couldnt possibly survive without him finally one week dad had enough he happened to be the one to help this customer after countless times of seeing his behavior the guy threw out his usual attitude and complaints and pressed my dads buttons as my dads only child i can attest to the fact that you do not want to press his buttons my dad lets loose on this asshole he says who the f do you think you are you come in here every week acting like a douche for worth of feeders well let me tell you something i sell those for those cost me cents the bag costs me another cents thats cents not including the labor to serve your pompous ass every week how much shit do you expect me and my employees to take for your cents a week do you think you keep me in business i will be out of these fish tomorrow someone else will buy them so fuck off i dont remember exactly what the guy said back but it was shitty and whatever it was set my dad off guy said he would never shop here again and it was cut rate and blah blah i think my dad starts going off on this guy to the point where he looks afraid he says fuck this and leaves my dad follows him out to his car telling him off the whole time by this point the guy realizes my dad is insane the rest of us already knew this and were in hysterics he tries getting in his car my crazy dad blocks the door of his car until he finished saying what he had to say finally he is done and he and the guy just look at each other for a minute the guy says im really sorry dad says you should be asshole by this time we were in tears watching this unfold the next week the guy shows up and is the nicest person ever he continued to buy his feeders from us for several years without incident next up dads business meetings 
i very rarely get complaints on me and it has been more than two years since someone was so unsatisfied with my help that they actually called corporate on me but that all changed last week i had been going around the dog food section of the store facing the cans and smaller bags when an older man maybe in his s walked up and asked if he could get someone to help him get a lb bag of dog food up to the front he did not have a cart with him so i told him that i would be happy to help i grabbed his chosen bag and walked up to the front with him nothing really seemed amiss i made small talk asked about what kind of dog he had chatted about the weather because anything below in florida is worth talking about i helped him out to his car thanked him for his patronage to our store and went about my day all seemed well yesterday however i get called into the office where my gm is waiting to speak to me she tells me we have a huge complaint on me and that it has gone up to our dm and that i am to receive a writeup as per his orders apparently i was expected to have gone and gotten one of our male associates to help this guy i insulted and humiliated this customer by grabbing the bag myself he said in his complaint that it was totally unacceptable for a little girl to lift those bags and that i was obviously trying to make him look like a weak old man in front of other customers i am so mad about this because i got the write up which i refused to sign because all i was doing was my job and had to have a counseling session with out gm and asm about how to properly respect out customers when i was hired i had to prove that i could lift and carry lbs if i wanted to work on the floor for this exact reason floor associates have to be able to help customers with bags and boxes that they would not be able to lift themselves i was never once rude to this man never once mentioned anything about how he needed help with the bag i did my utmost to provide the best customer service to him and followed the stores stupid ass guest model of customer service i did everything right and i am still getting in trouble over it and my gm and asm never once said that it was a shit complaint they just kept going over and over how i need to be more aware of customer sensitivities and how it really is reasonable that an older man would not want lifting help from a foot tall little girl so sorry sir that i did my damned job and even helped you out to your car uhg i am so mad sorry for the rant guys but i figured you lovely retail folks would understand the need to vent this edit i have now made a call to my hr department and am waiting to hear back from them the moment the phrase gender discrimination and sexism came into the conversation i was transferred to a supervisor they seemed very sympathetic and more than a little bit worried about legal trouble over this i have gotten a copy of the write up that i now have at home ill get back as soon as i have any more information about the situation editedit i also have faxed a copy of my write up to hr so they have a copy of it as well editeditedit because i was just reminded is a link to the resolution of this epic journey of bullshittiness
recently i got a new job doing customer service at one of the biggest electronic companies in the us a little background on myself im currently in college working on my ba in art design amp visual communications which is a fancy way to say graphic design so part of customer service also means ringing at the front lanes every once in awhile a man comes up to me and shows me two pieces of paper my companies online price for a gb flash drive and a competitors online companies price for the same product my company is big on price matching so of course i have to check it out heres the thing my companys regular price for this product was and the competitor companys regular price was i was skeptical and it was one of my first days alone at the register so i read the descriptions thoroughly they were exactly the same examined the product pictures exactly the same even examined the model numbers exactly the same but then i realized something very subtle the title and description font used on my companies website was the exact same same size same color same spacing not one word out of place after taking three typography based classes i could catch these little details from a mile away i immediate realized this guy photoshopped the title description model number etc over a cheaper flash drive from the competitor company i tell a little white lie to the customer to see if hell nudge gtme sir we actually arent allowed to price match according to print outs id need to see the website in live view just to make sure the sale hasnt run out if you have your phone on you we could check it out on there gt gtcustomer i dont have my phone with me cant you just adjust it its the exact same model number and everything gt gtme i cannot but id be happy to look it up on my phone for you if you dont have yours he was visually getting nervous through out the conversation and as soon as i pulled my phone out he bolted i continued to check after he left and of course i was right and they say art degrees are useless
it was a typical shift still handing out the coupons where you get off if you spend and get off if you spend it was the last day of the coupons so we were telling everyone and advising they grab a chocolate bar to take them over the line all of them were extremely grateful and some we spotted a couple more times grabbing things for the freezer stocking up on sodapet food i get to a lady gl and she has a glutenfree recipe book i very vaguely thumbed through since a loved one has just been diagnosed with a gluten allergy and was struggling with adjusting we talked about the book for a little bit as i scan the rest of her items and then we get to her total just shy of so i tell her about the coupon deal and she goes to grab a couple more things to take her over she brings the last of the glutenfree recipe books over gets off pays for everything and then gives the second recipe book to me gl here cook some nice things for her for me its pretty much free with this coupon so take it home for me im floored at this point here i was thinking shed be giving it to a neighbor or something ive had nice customers ive been tearyeyed before seeing a oncepregnant regular with a newborn or hearing about them falling on hard times but this time i straightup cried no customer had ever done that for me before i never expected it i thanked her profusely and kept making sure if it was alright which she said it was my manager was watching and he pulled me aside explaining that i wasnt meant to receive gifts from customers i went to give the book to him but he told me hed turn a blind eye just this once i put it in my locker and took it home after my shift she didnt have to do that it was so nice of her tldr happy tears customer gave me something out of the kindness of her heart 
so im back home on break from college and return to work at my grocery store in a few days just in time for the prechristmas rush yesterday i was doing some last minute christmas shopping at a large superstore pushing a cart of items while wearing my winter coat and jeans what i was wearing is important because a rather large woman on an electric scooter murica came up to me and demanded to know where the peanut butter and paper towels were we were in the electronic section so she was impressively far off i politely said that i dont work here but theyre probably in the grocery department across the store she ignored the first part of my statement and demanded i go get them for her because thats too far i repeated that i dont work here and turned so she could see that i was wearing a jacket and jeans instead of a polo of a certain color that this stores employees wear and slacks this is where it went from crazy to insane she said that she knew i worked there and claimed i took my name tag off when i saw her coming she called me lazy and stupid and said if i didnt want to work here then i shouldnt have dropped out of school she then demanded again that i go get her peanut butter and paper towels at this point i saw my opportunity to finally tell a customer off it was as another customer but hey thats still something and as i dont get to do this at work i went a bit overboard i told her that she was an entitled bh who clearly didnt need any more food but if she really desired it then she should get up off her fat ass and walk across the damn store like everyone else i also told her that i am in school and reiterated that i dont work at this store or for this chain or in this town i also pointed out the large signs hanging as you come in that point you to different sections of the store electronics and grocery were in opposite directions so clearly she was the stupid one i then continued on not worried about seeing her again as those scooters are really really slow when you put a huge person on them it might be a bit petty and an overreaction but it was my big chance to snap back
i used to work years ago in a retail store now fortunatly i work in it and have limited customer interaction the store i worked in was a hobby shop mostly cheapish stuff though we also sold some highend soft guns some ranging up to all of us in the store the store manager full time employees and part timers had a really great bond only the higher up managers made the work kinda suckish but that is another tale indeed and thankfully they didnt show themselves too often any way one day when i was working the register a father and his son entered the store and started looking at one of the more expensive soft guns we usually had a lot of lookie loos so after checking if they needed assistance i went back to my business i dont mind kids wanting to look at the cool guns its actually nice hearing how excited they sometimes get after a bit of looking the father f cleared his throat and pointed at the gun f we would like that one me sure thing ill just get my coworker to get it out of stock hey coworker cw would you mind going to the back to get this gun for the customer me to the father and child again it really is a nice soft gun youve chosen i then describe all the advantages of the gun to them me ill just ring you out while we wait for coworker to get back it will be please f oh we have an agreement with the manager that we could get this for half price me im sorry but i highly doubt that since that would make us loose money on the sale though this is a bit of an exaggeration it would be close enough that it just wouldnt be feasible f starting to get angry now listen i called and spoke with the manager who assured me that i could get this for half price me im sorry but i would know if you had and im not aware of such an agreement at this time my coworker comes back with the gun and having overheard the last bit of conversation i see in his eyes he thinks he knows full well how this will end f angry now whats your name ill tell the manager about this he and i are very good friends me my names mbrondum coworker could you get the manager for us i could see this surprised my coworker at bit but he quickly caught on and nooded cw sure thing he started walking to the back then turned around hey mbrondum could you go to the register a customers wants to speak with the manager me of course turning to the father again im sorry i forgot to tell you im the manager of this store and i have in no way spoken with you about getting anything half off and i do not believe i know you so the good friendsstuff you mentioned isnt true either never have i seen an angry man deflate so fast being caught in a lie that red handed they ended up not buying the soft gun but cw and i did get a good laugh out of it edit to clearify soft guns is a local dialect abbreviation of airsoft guns

back in my old video game job where we were crazy about games we used to have a policy that customers could try out any game in the store it really helped cut down on returns this meant however that we would get a few customers who would abuse this policy enter draconian i dont know his real name i just know that every character he made on any game and the xbox profile he set up on our demo unit was named draconian he was a late teensearly s man child about and overweight he would come in almost daily and spend hours playing games rarely purchasing anything when this happened the elder scrollsoblivion had come out draconian was coming in daily and spent literally hours standing in one spot and playing the game i would inform him every half hour or so that he needed to take a break and could just play games all day he would save walk away for a minute and jump right back to it when i started working on something else after a few days of this i was tired of him the next time he came in he played oblivion for a solid hours i didnt bother him once when he finally took his leave of the game and i was sure he was gone i loaded up his game and dumped almost a weeks worth of progress in one part of the map warped him across the map to the woods and left his character naked and alone deleted every save file except this one and shut the game off the next time draconian came in he asked to play oblivion i gladly obliged put the game in and walked away i can still remember him sputtering and frantically trying to search for a way to get his progress back he was nearly in tears as he left minutes after tldr customer abuses store policy so i leave him naked in the woods

 so yesterday i was called to the managers office and told that i had a customer complaint that they needed to go over with me needless to say i was with the manager for about an hour on this but i will not give you a play by play recap i will just do a quick run through the customer called and complained because of the fact that i rang her up too quickly my department tends to be pretty busy customer wise and i have a lot of regulars too well apparently it turns out that the complaint i got made the store manager dig into my records a bit which when i was told this made me think i might of screwed something up big time well after a little bit of talking about averages in our department he told me that a single cashier does not get the customer numbers i do and then he called in my supervisor the supervisor then said your in for it now and gave a small laugh the manager said he had gone through the transaction reports on my numbers and that roughly a quarter of total store sales went through my register this year alone and that he had called our district manager on the matter the district manager has also looked over the information and approved a small bonus for you and starting next month you will become the store training supervisor your going to be train our newer cashiers on the registers and they will be helping you in your department for training you will have a little more of a work load but it is a higher pay grade for you and looks at my supervisor and said since that would be on par with your pay level your going to be raised a level also so the details of my new position is one week a month i will be training new cashiers up front and showing them the ropes i will be involved in hiring of new cashiers also i also now have to deal with schedules for the new cashiers for my week i get them and i have been given access to the system for this stuff which luckily my terminal in my department can do so wish me luck everyone editupdate got paperwork done my bonus will be on my next check bucks thanks everyone for the support sorry i know my grammar is horrible but also usually only on here for minutes if that on here i start vacation tuesday my first day as trainer starts when i return wish me luck

so here is the full story when you call my store i always attempt to answer my phone even if it is to tell you to hold because at least then you know someone will be with you about two weeks ago i answered the phone and it was a gentleman asking about the cost of tires well this is a standard thing i can do tire quotes easy and since i know the state tax tables and other costs of installation fees i can give you total including tax which according to everyone i talk to on the phone no one else in town does this so we make many sales just from being able to give a to the penny cost jumping ahead to the next day the gentleman comes in and purchases tires nothing abnormal about this he came in around am and that was that about pm i get a call from the gentleman he was asking some information on the road hazard warrenty he purchased and some of the cashiers do not explain the coverage so i go over the warrenty information coverage does not cover vandalism or wrecks or wreckless driving so curbing the tires is not covered well he tells me that he was driving home from work when his brakes went out and he had to ditch the vehicle or end up in a possible tbone because he was near a intersection with the major highway through town i would have done the same well i asked if everyone was ok he said yes but two of his tires got badly damaged one was torn up out right and the other had a bad goose egg on the side well i told him unfortunately this type of damage was not covered under the warrenty he calmly replied i was afraid of that and he asks the costs of replacing just the two tires he did not sound mad at me and he was pretty calm which we get calls like this from time to time but usually end in someone yelling at me over the phone so i decided since he was being nice i would try to go above expectations so i ask the gentleman to hold while i look up the tires and cost he agrees and i put him on hold so i call up the assistant manager and tell him what is going on the guy bought tires that morning and how they were damaged i tell him normally something like this is not covered but the man was on the phone and was not angry and was inquiring about cost to replace if we can at least comp one of the tires well the manager tells me to do it since i felt compelled enough to even ask to do this and only one tire since the tires the man got were on the more pricey side so i switch back over to the line with the gentleman i told the gentleman i was able to get permission to comp one of the tires and gave him the price for the other the man was very happy to hear this and i got his name and info so when he showed up with the tires to comp the one tire which would take him a couple of days to come in because his car was in the shop having his breaks repaired two days later the gentleman showed up and i rang up the order and he told me to thank the person on the phone i told him that was me he talked to and he then said i want you to know you have a very kind gentle and sultry voice on the phone well i did not know what sultry meant at the time and thought it was weird but said thanks and he left i later googled sultry and now realize that was kind of creepy well i was off work yesterday and the department manager called me which is unusual he normally will just text me if he needs me to come in early or later than normal so i answer my phone figuring somethings hit the fan and he needs help quick no luck on that apparently the guy called and asked if i was working yesterday and the manager told him i was off and the dude asked him if he could have my home number the manager refused that well he said around two hours later a delivery guy showed up with flowers addressed to me and the card had a phone number that had the dudes cell phone as a note i am male also and happily married so my wife when i told her what happened she just laughed her butt off and jokingly told me to let me know when the wedding was going to be so yup i officially have a creepy stalker now tldr was nice to a customer and now he is sending me flowers at work and asking people for my phone number creeper style edit ok so he showed up again yesterday and i told him i was not interested oddly enough he took it well and apologized if he seemed a little too forward he was apparently having a long streak of real bad luck apparently he just recently moved into town and has not had much a good time in doing so as place he was living in recently had a pipe burst and did some major damage and he lost alot of his things from the flooding and the landlord had to get it fixxed but the damage was real bad so he is living in a hotel room for weeks while the landlord has people doing the repairs and he had nails in his tires from somewhere and was why he originally bought tires that morning and then his breaks went out on the car so admittedly he had some shitty luck and he thought it was getting worse when i told him on the phone warrenty did not cover wreck damage but i was nice enough to comp and help him out i told him i hope his luck gets better

i work in a gift shop in australia and we also sell lotto tickets for the most part customers are polite and i dont have to deal with rudeness very often usually only of us is there at any point in time unless it is christmas or a big lotto draw so basically if i am there alone im the boss its a slow day so im just standing behind the counter greeting people and letting them have a look around there are teenage girls i guess around years old in the birthday cards having a giggle at them and a father and his young daughter i guess the daughter to be years old and they are looking for a gift for mum i cant see the girls in the cards properly since they are behind the shelves but i overhear the following girl i guess hes ok looking but steve was really nice to me so i gave him a blowjob girl oh yeah steve is pretty nice i consider going over there to tell them to shut up when i see the little girl look at her dad and ask what does blowjob mean daddy i dont think he had heard the other girls and he looked shocked and muttered something about when you are older the little girl was persistent and said what does it mean daddy i went around to the teens in the cards and could hear them dropping swear words while seemingly talking about some slut i ask them politely to not swear in the store especially since there is a child present they roll their eyes and go back to looking at the cards this whole time the little girl has been trying to get out of her father what a blowjob is and looking baffled he says something along the lines of when a girl loves a boy its just something they do but not until you are older now please stop asking and tell me what you think of this for mummy at this stage im back behind the counter and i serve someone getting lotto and i can again hear the teens swearing and laughing followed by a sshh that bitch will come back i finish with the customer and head back around there and now im mad me i asked you to stop swearing please leave girl hahahaha no you cant make us me yes i can please leave now the little girl over there has started repeating your filth and other customers can hear your language girl its a free country and i can say whatever i fucking want girl laughs and rolls her eyes me i dont have to serve you and have every right to kick you out of a space we pay for because as you said free country and all that now get out before i call security to escort you out this was a complete bluff im not even sure what security there is they walk out swearing their heads off and threats of my mother the father and daughter come and pay for a nice picture frame to put a picture of themselves in for mum i chat with them for a bit and on their way out i hear the little girl say i love you daddy can i give you a blowjob needless to say he rushed her out looking mortified a few minutes later girl comes in with her mother and i brace myself for whatever rant im about to cop mother i asked girl to buy a card and you kicked her out why slightly snarky kind of attitude me they were swearing in the shop a young girl overheard the word blowjob and started putting her dad in an awkward situation when asking him to explain the word i asked them to stop swearing and using that language when they didnt i told them to leave mother to girl you what give me your phone now girl hands over phone with tears in her eyes how dare you that poor girl you are not to see girl again you are grounded she turns back to me and speaks sweetly she told me you threw her out for opening the music cards im really sorry for her behavior me no worries enjoy your day the mother ranted loudly at her crying daughter on the way out and it was glorious tldr little girl asks dad if she can give him a blowjob i get to kick bitches out of the shop girl gets grounded edit thanks for all the comments i just got back from sleep and work to address a couple of comments i didnt rat her out to her mum about the context the word blowjob was used in because i figured its possible she was showing off to her friend or trying to sound cool though honestly it would not surprise me if it were true the father probably should have just said i dont know but the look on his face he just panicked ill be sure to post more stories at some point but this is easily one of the best ones

spotted this yesterday while i was out shopping a group of lads all in school uniform were in a mini supermarket getting a few bits one of them gets pushed into a rack of bottles full of sauce spices and herbs near one of the tills the rest of the group runs off out of the shop but the one who got pushed into the rack stays where he is instead of getting angry or running off he goes to one of the staff and says the following gt alright man listen ive made a bit of a mess just there on the spicer rack do you lot have a sweeping brush and a scoop ill clean it up for you the staff were amazed by how to the point he was anyone else would have just left i hung around to watch what happened for health and safety they couldnt let him sweep up the glass but he paid for most of the damage it was about euro he paid he walked off with a smile and an ice cream and the manager was wondering if they could hire him edit ill be damned my first gold thank you 
i was with my manager doing cash pulls around pm on the first of our four front end customer service tills this middle aged woman walks in asks if she can get a money order manager says no but i ask her if i can take the nice lady on the last register as to not impede the pulls she agrees and i begin the customer never did get to get her name tells me that this money order is for rent and that she is grateful that i am able to take her i tell her that customer service formally closed at pm but she had arrived just in time and found someone who is crosstrained all over the front end she tells me shes grateful to have run in just in time for this and to have found someone willing to help this was her last option for a store to get a money order for rent and that if it wasnt deposited by business open for what is now today shed be charged an extra as a late fee im glad to be of help and begin processing the order as she grabs her card to pay all readied to be paid she swipes her card met with an error for insufficient funds she grabs her phone and opens her banks app and tells me that shes short and wont be able to pay rent after all for short is unacceptable i scrounge through my pockets and find miscellaneous coins that come out to toss it on her order and tell her to go ahead and swipe again transaction goes through lady is almost in tears asks if theres a manager around she can speak to about me tell her that my immediate manager is standing behind me and just saw it happen she wants more informed her theres a survey on the receipt and a customer comment box behind her she can put in her words on my service she spends almost minutes writing before dropping it in and thanks me again before heading out im just glad to be of good help to such a nice little lady merry christmas and happy holidays all remember the small things can have incredible impacts edit id like to take a moment and say thank you for the gold please though use that three bucks to keep some change in your pocket if youre a retail slave too and use it to help out the nice customers when theyre short a bit 
i sell and install high end door hardware at a small family business the hardware i sell starts at per door and goes up to per door and being so we mostly work with high end builders basically most customers arent too price sensitive we also tell them we cant compete with online prices before we even start looking at hardware my job is to help the customer find hardware that matches their home and then do a walkthrough of their home to get door handings thicknesses back sets and trim size its actually really fun walking through expensive homes as theyre finishing being built i had a husband and wife come in a few months ago and i took them through the showroom showing which options would go well with their new home it took a little over an hour and we chose all the interior hardware but differentspecial hardware for the master bedroom lower level and set them up with special plates for their exterior doors i gave them a quote while they were there showing which roomsdoors get what hardware and they seemed happy with it great another happy customer they have me email them a copy of the quote and they say theyll be in touch for me to do the walkthrough a few days go by and i get an email from them saying they found everything much cheaper online with free shipping of course and asking if i can price match gtme sorry as i said when we first started i cant price match as i have a large showroom and offer design and technical help gtcustomer i can get everything for almost cheaper though per hardware set gtme sorry but theres not much i can do i did help you choose your selections for over an hour though and with the hardware you picked out youll need to get all the specs right when ordering gtcustomer well everything is much cheaper online so thats what im going to have to go with so a few weeks go by and i get a call from the customers builder hes complaining that most of the door hardware was delivered wrong and telling me someone needed to come to the job site and sort it out i told the builder his customer didnt buy from me but had mentioned ordering online the builder sighed said ok and hung up today i heard the rest of the story apparently the customer took my quote and ordered online directly off of that my quote didnt have any technical specs for the hardware so they guessed their way through the whole thing when the carpenters tried to install it nothing fit the builder told the customer to send everything back and order from my company but the customer was too embarrassed so they ordered from a competitor much further away i bet with the restock fee on their online order and the additional travel expenses for the other hardware company the customer probably spent twice as much as would have if they just went with me
today i was shopping at a big box department store in a very affluent community i got in the checkout line and noticed that the welltodo lady in front of me had a bunch of inexpensive toys she said with a smile almost apologetically im grabbing all of your dinosaurs today while gesturing toward her basket there were little baggies of small plastic dinosaurs she had purchased about of them the cashier giggled haha oh no you cant do that she joked some little kid is going to be so upset i know right they were kidding of course i mean the chances that someone is going to show up wanting those dinosaurs today had to be pretty slim what are you going to do with them the cashier asked oh well i keep my eye out for things like this on sale and i save them at the end of the year i put together gift sets for organization for needy children whoa i mean its march this lady spends all year collecting small gifts for needy children im sure she ends up with some pretty awesome stuff in the mix too mad props to the nice lady she seriously made me think about what i could be doing to make a little bit of difference in the lives of others tears
so im on an express checkout a few years ago and this guy comes up with about bunches of different flowers and a roll of wrapping paper he tells me he forgot his anniversary and was buying all the flowers he could carry i just laugh along because he wasnt stressed about it and was laughing at how he forgot he pays for the flowers and takes them all in his arms and leaves in my store where the express checkout is you can see out the door so i could see everything he did next he rolled out the wrapping paper and opened all the bunches of flowers and began arranging them he spent the next minutes arranging the flowers and when he was dont he started rolling them up with the wrapping paper into what became the most amazing and biggest bouquet of flowers ive ever seen he just stood up and held the bouquet in his arms as he left like the triumphant bastard he was 
a young woman probably or so came into the bank with her mother the young woman had down syndrome and her mother was showing her how to do some banking checking her balance paying bills and taking out some cash the young woman was very polite and her mother was very specific explaining to the daughter how to be clear about what she wants for example when the daughter asked for cash she said twenty sixty and then the mother specified that she should ask for the total amount she wanted first and then what kind of bills she wanted three s even though it was her first time at the bank i can tell you that this young woman was far more clear and specific about what she wanted than many older customers with more experience who expect me to read their mind at the end of the transaction i went over her receipt with her and summarized everything as i do with all customers and she seemed really grateful for the summary as she was leaving i heard her say to the mother i did it and the mum was really proud theres your daily dose of heartwarming from bureaucratic red tape factory actually there were a few others but this is my favourite

this story is my favourite one to tell new staff members about how the customer doesnt always win its a long read but very worth it by the way this story takes place in australia i worked at a bakery as a manager of sorts which involved a lot of disputes about baked goods we made cakes entirely from scratch something thats uncommon where i live on a friday afternoon a couple of old ladies in nice clothes come in and completely ignore the queue and anxiously shout that they need a cake for tomorrow a bakers nightmare i politely tell them that ill be with them as soon as i can as the shop was filled with regulars who were loyal to the shop and i didnt want to invalidate them this concept seemed to be lost on these lovely ladies as they pushed their way to the coffee machine and told the barista a timid year old girl that they urgently needed to order a cake she seemed a bit intimidated by them but stood her ground and informed them that shes not in charge of that earning her a high five from me later they literally huffed i could hear both their huffs separately at the same time i had taken a mental note of where they were in the line and gave one of the regulars a former employee an exasperated look and he winked and gestured for them to be served earning him a free coffee for the day the following conversation is word for word the ladies are known as arrogant birch amp ab amp ab me hi there sorry about ab finally me the wait its pretty frantic at the momen ab im having a party i need to order a cake for tomorrow me we usually require hours notice on cake orders otherwise there is a surcharge this was optional on my end i was going to try to build some rapport ab oh we only found out about it this morning yeah a party you heard about this morning and need a custom cake for i looked over my shoulder and quietly told them that i understand and i hate that policy so ill waive the fee if we keep it between us you would think they would be appreciative but no they smelled weakness i showed them our cakes and they decided on an x vanilla slice cake with blue icing on top with some edible flowers i smelled chanel no and she had an oroton bag i couldve charged and i took their deposit i had showed them our range of blue colours and they agreed on a specific shade of blue i started at am that saturday as i was learning how to cook as i was trained in coffee mainly so it was me and the owner a total character he was irish so naturally we had a few beers and he taught me and we joked around till opening time which was always a blast i told him about abamp and he rolled his eyes and called them feckin cunts and taught me how to hand craft chocolate flowers for their cake which was fucking awesome by pm we were exhausted but had some fresh staff handling the customers enter ab the bitchier one i could hear her shouting into her phone from the back i gave irish a look making him chuckle and throw air punches before heading out the front with her cake me hi there ab she saw me and gave a look of contempt great start we just finished your cake hours ago would you like to have a look ab of course you think ill take it without seeing it i chuckled and showed her the cake and she let out a disgusted groan ab this isnt what i ordered me oh im sorry i was tired and gave her the benefit of the doubt what did you order ab its the wrong colour me oh im sorry what was it meant to be ab its the wrong blue she then proceeds to pull out a selection of blue swatches used for paint colours ab i wanted this one give me a discount ive had enough by now me the price is and with your deposit the remaining due is ab this is completely unacceptable i demand to speak to your manag me i am the manager pretty much true at the time ab well i want to speak to the owner me k i fetch irish whos already in a shit mood as his wifes coming in soon and he comes out the front irish allrighht whats thee cohmmootion he knows everyone within a mile radius at all times so a barrage of greetings hit him and he says hello to people is seconds in different ways a skill he had ab your irish do ya wan the fecking caike or not ab i was just discount irish thee price es whataver he says itis he then proceeds to hold he cake over the bin irish yees or noh ab i wan bam he throws the cake in the bin and the store erupts in laughter and i thrust her deposit into her hands irish nhext she didnt come back
long time lurker first time poster there is no dana only zuul this is a story about sir in college i worked in a large retail store part time during the year and full time during the summer my second summer on the job i had been sort of promoted to second in charge within the domestics department all day every day id maintain the aisles and back room and stock shelves one day i am refolding a wall of towels that i had watched get systematically destroyed by a family redecorating their bathroom im slightly grumps because we have all of the towels open and displayed in plain sight and customers often unknowingly damage the towels when they open them and then decide they do not want them anymore every time they would replace them by twirling the towel into a heap and stuffing it into the shelf often snagging the fabric we had horrible metal shelves that corporate refused to replace im sorting through the crumpled towels attempting to carefully extract them from the jaws of mischief when a new employee approaches me gtne um sorry could you help me please gtme hey yeah whats up gtne well uh theres a guy who needs some help and im not sure how to help him i think hes chinese but i cant understand what he wants gtme ok sure where is he gtshe points towards vacuums giggles uncomfortably and then walks away im a little confused that she just booked it but shes new and doesnt really understand how to hand off customers yet i leave my department and see a little old asian guy wandering near the vacuum aisle i casually walk on up to him gtme sir can i help you oh my i almost step back as sir starts waving his hands around like a lunatic it was a little overwhelming hes spinning his arms around and reaching out towards me and twisting his hands around in a lewd manner he even mimicked spraying something on his face i now understand why ne got intimidated if his face hadnt been so pained and humiliated i wouldve thought he was just being rude he continued to make these motions while i looked at him attempting to understand what was going on he pointed at his shopping cart towards the shelves and then started the motions again thats when it clicked i was in a real life game of charades once i figured this out i began to focus on what he was doing i also looked at his cart saw a sun hat and sunblock and realized what it was he wanted a personal fan that sprays water on your face i motioned for him to come with me and led him to the back of the store where an end cap had a display of plastic fan bottles the look of happiness and relief on his face was like sunshine his excitement was almost tangible as he picked out a couple and then began to mime out another item i spent more minutes helping him find the items he was unable to locate all through his movements and gestures i will never forget him describing hot sauce i hadnt had that much fun with a customer until that point or since he was absolutely delightful he eventually became a regular at the store he began to call me jean meh it starts with an j so close enough i also began to carry a pad of paper and a pencil in order to help us out sometimes a friend of mine taught me some basic formal chinese for when i was confused just simple stuff like how many i dont understand please draw it my last year working there sir brought in his son to the store and brought him to my department sirs son was just as cheery as his father he thanked me for being such a help to his father and apologized for any time it took me away from my job i was absolutely touched that he had mentioned me to his family sir was well known and well liked in the store by the time i had left and i was certain that hed have a charades partner for as long as he wanted edit wow guys this outpouring of support and good vibes is one of the reasons this is my favorite sub all of these stories youve posted about your experiences are beautiful i know im biased but i firmly believe working in retail improves your character although retail is a tough line of work to be in it strengthens you and helps you discover that you have the ability to make a difference in peoples lives no matter how small your action may seem at the time its lovely that through all the issues and crap we have to deal with all i see on this sub is a group of amazing people who support and lift each other up you guys blow me away 
once upon a time i used to work in a small town mompop pet store the owner and her daughter are what we considered the managers and they would usually rotate days so that at least one of them was present in the store at all times on any given day the mother t and the daughter h also just so happen to specialize in different animal areas in the store h oversees all of the fish herself especially the salt water tanks since they can be a little tricky to maintain its a slow day and in the later afternoon h and i are just starting the rounds of food and water before we close in a couple of hours when this older lady walks in she starts telling us about her son who is actively in afghanistan somewhere but would be coming home for good soon he loves salt water fish and when he went into the service several years prior he had to give up all of the fish and tanks since there would be no one to care for them properly while he was away she tells us that she has cared for his empty house since he left and wants to get a full salt water tank set up in his living room to surprise him when he gets home this of course hits all the aww buttons for us as this old lady is just trying to do something sweet for her military son so we start gathering everything she needs such as the filter system substrate fake plant lifeshe insisted and fish food etc once weve walked her through picking out all of the hardware we start getting into her options of live fishto be ordered and picked up later and when its all said and done shes racked up a receipt of over weve spent over an hour with her at this point and have made sure to repeatedly tell her everything that she has to do to maintain the tank for the few days until the son gets home we also recommend getting a book for fish tank beginners that we offer by the register just in case she forgets anything we tell her as she pulls out a bank envelope to pay its only about twenty minutes until closing and therefore weve been happily helping her for almost two hours shes just handed the money to h when she drops this bombshell so when i get this stuff to his house i just throw some table salt into the water and the fish will be fine once they get in there apparently our two hour conversation went completely in one ear and out the other and h just looks stunned for a moment as shes unsure of what to say we ended up making a list of every little thing shed purchased packed everything into the empty tank and set it in the back room to wait we convinced her that he would be much more excited to set it up himself and after a little talking she took a shine to that idea she paid for a store credit so that he could pick out the fish he wanted and h put her signature on the list and receipt to reassure her that we wouldnt forget everything was already paid for he came in about a week later with the list and receipt he was incredibly excited and thanked us profusely for not letting his mother take anything home herself as he revealed that she had no one to help her carry the heavy tank he was very grateful for our help and patience and went home a happy guy edit details

id love to say that this was my idea but i was only a witness to this moment of genius i was queuing in the ten items or less line in a wellknown uk supermarket chain just as the cashier was helping one elderly customer bag her items with the next guy about to unload his items onto the counter a short woman in a business suit pushed her way in between him and the cashier i heard her mumble to him just grabbing lunch im running late before chucking her meal deal which consisted of a sandwich a bottle of juice and a packet of crisps onto the counter i should clarify that i was about third out of six or seven people in this queue and there was only one ten items or less lane the store was busy and we were all trying to buy our lunches as the cashier was helping the first lady with her bags and credit card the guy who was supposed to be next in line without saying a single word to the queuejumper picked her bottle of juice off the counter knelt down and rolled it along the ground towards the back of the queue she turned to him as he picked up her packet of crisps and chucked them to the back of the queue too her expression will be burned into my memory for eternity she couldnt legitimately complain because she along with everyone around her was perfectly aware of what she had tried to do plus there was a whole queue of hungry british people observing her now she stared daggers at the guy she tried to skip picked up her sandwich then storming off a whole five metres to pick the rest of her lunch off the floor then disappeared back into the aisles in a fit of embarrassed rage the tension generated in those few moments made me feel proud to be british i still dont know if she managed to buy her lunch that day
during my time in the retail industry i was hired for night shift but training took place in the morning shift this story took place during my training they have a training system that goes like this day orientation days book training day computer training day on the day shift floor to wait for authentication of online testing now they are slow with their implementation of testing because as it were there was a delay between the modules being ready for the individual employees and the book training to be complete so training took days well on my last day of training i came into the training center and the coordinator for training and employees was dealing with this guy that had a thick trinidadian accent he couldnt read or write in english she asked me to help him with filing out his job application on the job center machine i happily obliged and took him to one and began testing i put in his name for him i read him the questions i chose the corresponding answer for him and this took about hours because of a mixture of him not understanding the questions and taking a while to answer them but he also kept saying he was a good worker and that he likes working because it keeps him busy i liked him he always smiled and was very friendly after his application was complete i said goodbye to him and wished him good luck well fast forward months later i was walking back to the break room and i saw a man folding clothes in the clothing section that looked like the man i had helped apply for a job just months prior he looked up and saw me with a smile already on his face and he got really happy ran up to me and hugged me he thanked me over and over again and told me he loved working there and that he was so grateful i was really happy for him seeing him make parttime made it even better

after a very eventful week in which i missed work because i was extremely ill i finally returned to my hallowed spot behind the register since the winter is mighty slow for us i guess one of my bosses got antsy and decided to tweak our pos settings so new and fun things printed out on our receipt in hindsight it really was my fault for leaving her unattended with the register for a week one of these new and fun things happened to include the receipt now printing the first and last name of the cashier who rang them up im not a crazy privacy nut but this this freaked me out and pissed me off the receipt already prints out our employee code when we ring the sale i called my boss and asked her what pos option she had fiddled it so i could fiddle it back to off imagine my shock at her shock on why i would want to do this what is so bad about the receipt printing the first and last name of the cashier oh i dont know irate customers having personal information crazy customers having personal information any customer having personal information the list goes on my first and last name are one google search away from my address my facebook my embarrassing angstriddled teenage blogs that i keep meaning to delete my boss told me to leave the option turned on so i created a fake facebook account using a male name and sent her a private message detailing how i thought she was so pretty and how i was too shy to say that when she rang me up but i got her name off the receipt and just had to contact her two hours after i sent the message she called me and told me to turn the option off 
i recently discovered this sub and i am hooked i love all the good and even bad stories because i just laugh at how crazy people are heres one of my own i worked as a cashier at a grocery store and for the most part enjoyed it people made small talk and were typically polite i knew most of the regulars by name there was one asian lady who came in quite frequently with her husband who was in a wheelchair he seemed like a grump and she was a bit eccentric probably s pink hair hello kitty stuff they were an interesting couple but always seemed to get along i mentioned she was asian because sometimes he would have to decipher what she was saying or correct her english a bit well one day she comes in and buys a ton of the pork on sale i asked her what it was all for and really only understood dumplings but she was excitedly saying something else i couldnt quite catch it smiled and nodded and sent her on her way a few hours later she returns with her husband and a large to go box seeks me out and really excitedly hands me the box i was pretty confused and her husband explained that she really wanted me to try her amazing dumplings because i was so nice to her all the time well they were amazing and pretty much every time i saw her after that she had a small container of dumplings just for me she always managed to catch me before a break or lunch which was awesome she was really sad when i told her i was moving on to a new job after about a year and she made sure to bring me some extra dumplings the last time she saw me edit im glad you all seem to really enjoy this story ill have a few more to come but theyll be the crazy type

background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square foot of fireworks heaven ive posted a few other stories if youre interested story a guy came in to pick up some fireworks he was having a party and wanted to put on an impressive show for his friends i spent about minutes walking him through the store explaining the different items to him and showing him videos of the stuff to help him pick out exactly what he wanted he mentioned a couple of times how he usually goes to ltother storegt and how their prices were cheaper each time id apologized but i let him know that our prices were usually less than theirs and that i thought that we had beat them on each of the items in question the third time it happened i walked to our counter and grabbed the new catalog from ltother storegt i found the stuff he had mentioned and showed him how we were in fact cheaper on every item that he had selected and thats why i keep catalogs from my competitors on the counter in fact on a couple of items we were about half of ltother storegt price amazingly he didnt seem happy about it but he kept shopping by the time he was ready to check out he had a rolling flat cart full of stuff it was mostly large assortment packages finale cakes and big mortar kits with a few smaller items here and there to speed things up and prevent us from having to unload all the big kits onto the counter i started calling out the prices for the bigger items to the cashier my dad about halfway through i got to one of the largest items a massive mortar kit and called out the price of when my dad was ringing it in the register display looked like it had screwed up so i stopped him and went to check it out sure enough the item had rung in at while im talking to my dad about it the customer walks over and demands to see the mistake i show him that the last entry was for instead of he immediately tells me that i have to sell the item to him at the price that rang up i showed him that the item itself had the correct price tag on it and that the cashier had just misskeyed it when he had rung it in the guy gets agitated and repeatedly starts telling me that i have to legally sell the thing to him at that price since the cashier had rung it in like that i calmly explained that if the item had been priced wrong i would sell it to him at the incorrect price but since it was just a misskey we would just void the last item rung in and do it again now armchair lawyer guy alg starts yelling that he knows his rights and that im breaking the law if i have the cashier change the price and i dont sell it to him at the wrong price now ive had the staff screw up before when doing pricing and if we put the wrong lower price tag on something thats what im going to sell it to you for i also know that unless its an advertised price i dont legally have to do it but if i screwed up im going to eat that mistake and reprice the item after were done side note to josh c happy birthday today and next time pay attention to the damn price list when youre using the price gun because i know most of these screwups have your name on them also go back to school and dont do drugs me are you telling me that legally even if we screwed up i cant have the cashier fix a mistake and that i have to sell you the item at whatever price was keyed into the register alg yes me looking at my dad i guess were going to have to charge him whatever you keyed in i calmly walked back around the counter and picked up another item from his cart a small fountain with a price tag of and continued calling out the prices when we were all done my dad gave him the total alg that cant be right thats way too much theres no way i got that much stuff dad oops looks like the fountain rang in for did you want to pay that in cash or with a credit card alg just glared at my dad for a few seconds then quietly asked if we could fix it we happily fixed both mistakes boxed up his items and sent him on his way with a smile

a couple years ago when the ps and xbox one came out i was working in the electronics department of a big box store naturally it being early december and the consoles being brand new we were sold out and orders to get more in were backed up due to high demand so i come into work for am an hour before the doors open and there is a lady waiting in her carto stay warm before the store to open no big deal happens a lot this time of year at we open the doors and she beelines for my department before i can even say hi she demands the ps we have in stock now i had just checked inventory as part of my routine and knew we didnt receive any so we were still out of stock with an undefined under estimated delivery meaning our suppliers didnt know when nor have any either i apologize to her and inform her of the situation but she is having none of it she tells me she phoned last night and was told we were going to be getting one first thing in the morning which is strange because i was the only one who was in the previous night when she said she called realizing that she was going to start to cause trouble i suggested she try other stores in the area as they might have some in stock then she blows up at me insulting me and demanding to speak with my manager unfortunately for her i was the manager for my department and upon being informed of this she didnt know what to say for a minute after a few seconds of silence she started the customer is always right speech and demanded that i sell her our display ps for a discount because of the inconvenience i caused her and the use it had already received but i couldnt sell the display and when i told her that she started calling me a liar saying i was planning on buying it myself no thanks i like pc at that point i asked her if there was anything else she was looking for that i could help her with she then decided to channel her inner kid and just repeatedly say ps over and over i laughed in her face at how immature she was being and said well if youre trying to do a better portrayal of a four year old we have some huggies just a few aisles down over there i then went to the back room warehouse to continue my duties and when i came back minutes later she was gone and i never saw her again 
back in october nickelback was burning up the airwaves with their angsty canadian rock and their latest cd was the top seller at our music store for months one morning minutes before opening the store i noticed a woman pacing outside the door with that nickelback cd and a receipt in hand once am rolled around i unlocked and opened the door for her and before i could say anything her one of your employees sold me a bad cd last night it doesnt play at all not in my car not in my computer not in my cd player it just says error give me another one because she had her receipt from the night before i had no problem switching her faulty cd for another copy we had tons in stock so i grabbed a new one for her and threw the bad one into our defectives box before she left i opened the cellophane for her and checked that the disk was in good shape and she ran out to her car not seconds later she comes back into the store on the verge of tears her this cd doesnt work either same thing error what kind of mean joke are you trying to pull are you making fun of me for liking nickelback me no maam uh nickelback is awesome maybe it was a defective batch of cds from the distributor let me try it in our store player to see if i get the same error i checked the cd it did not have any scratches or fingerprints so i popped it into our player a few seconds later the generic rock sounds of nickelback played throughout the store the woman was shocked her i cant believe it how did you get it to work i tried everything i even followed the instructions on the cover and put it into the player silver side edit thanks for the gold and yeah i know this sounds like an elaborate dad joke but it really happened if you worked in this store back in the early aughts youd understand
so i had discovered that some enterprising person had replicated staff check seals little stickers put on staff purchases by a manager type as proof of purchase and was selling them online part of me loved the enterprising nature of whoever this was selling stickers for novelty use only i thought id do the right thing and i emailed the link to the auction to the store manager got a reply thanking me and it would be sent of yada yada each time i was on the online auction site say weekly id check and they continued to be sold one day i was in the staff room eating lunch the loss prevention manager for the chain came and sat opposite wed run into each other before so we were chatting a little bit anyway having a chat and he asks me what would you do to help with loss prevention so i told them about the checkseals to say he lost it is an understatement he released me from store duties we went into the office and had a phonelink with all sorts of people about it we then went to the police station filed a police report and did as much research on the seller buyers who bought the stuff etc back before the online auction locked everything down all of which took the whole day i was told not to say anything to anyone to be honest i largely forgot about it a month or so later i was summoned to head office interstate it turns out that the seller was an asm from a store interstate and every buyer the police tracked was an employee the asm sold at least roles of stickers i was given a exec for a day type of few days a cash bonus star hotel promise of a reference in the future etc i obviously knew why but they kept coy about the details only at the end of the few days i was told that the catch was likely to save the company in excess of k this was when i was still reasonably new to the workforce i felt like a million bucks at a time when i wasnt sure what to do with my life i was on the radar of some serious execs i went back into my store and you know what nothing noone knew a thing i could not leverage it at all everyone was under the impression i was on leave a couple of weeks later the sm asked while i was filling drinks oh i never followed your email up are they still selling talk about coming back down to earth 
i found out that you dont even need to be working retail to get the brunt of some rude customers i went to a school whose name is similar to a large craft store chain well just say the store started with ac something and my schools name started with moore i was home from break and working at a local sandwichconnivence store after work one day i decided i needed some brushes and ac something was on the way so im wearing my work uniform from my sandwich storeits just a polo shirt im also wearing a lanyard that is plastered with my schools name and attached are my keys and my student id which is also plastered with my schools name im in the painting section which is next to the fake flowers when an elderly lady doesnt just tap but grabs my arm lady you are there any more tulips me uh im sorry lady where are the rest of the tulips me sorry i dont know i dont work here lady dont lie to me it says you do right here the woman points to my lanyard and school id me oh no thats where i go to school laughing lady dont laugh at me goddamn lazy employees im going to go get your manager and youll see who is laughing now she walks away and i go back to looking at paint about three minutes later i hear the shrill voice of the old lady again lady there she is thats the girl what i assume to be the asst manager looks pissed asst manager im writing you up and you are going to help this woman me im sorry asst manager if you dont help this woman im writing you up twice me i dont work here asst okay if thats what you want consider yourself fired the old lady has a smug look on her face right then though what i assume to be the manager appears and asks the asst manager what happened asst she refuses to help this woman the manager looks pissed as well but when he walks up to me his face drops and he looks amused manager you dont work here me nope lady shes a bad employee manager she is not an employee mam she doesnt work here lady because you fired her manager no because she never worked here the manager then tells the old woman that he cannot have customers harassing other customers and he tells her to leave he profusely apologizes to me the woman turns bright purple and slinks away i get a off coupon and the manager tells the asst manager to meet him in the back office i still have no idea how the asst thought i worked there im guessing he just had no clue who was working there obviously now i always remember not to wear that lanyard and to stuff it in my bag before shopping there

hello tfr this tale happened yesterday at my job in a uk technology shop i was covering my coworker as greeter a man comes into the shop and made a beeline for me i greet him and prepare myself for any problems he may have him what are these i find myself holding a small sandwich bag the insides stained black with printer ink in the bowels of the bag are two cartridges i examine them trying to see if i can find a product code or identifying mark all it has is a list of canon printers its compatible with i think these are a pg and a cl si well then go fetch them good girl i freeze for a second as hes expecting me to run across half of our quite large store to fetch these for him as hes too entitled to do it himself all i can manage is a sorry im staying here and point him in the direction of our printing section stop trying to make fetch happen its not going to happen
 yesterday was a really cold day temps dropped below freezing after a very humid and warm couple of weeks this usually means we have to deal with tons of battery purchases and installations we were not disappointed usually people want cheap batteries except some people want batteries that are not made for there car we carry a low power battery it might have the power to make a geo metro turn over but thats about it this guy comes in and sees the cheap battery and he wants the battery i ask him year make model of vehicle he tells me it is a s model chevy pickup i tell him the battery does not have the power to turn over the truck and this is usually where the problems arise people do not like being told there vehicle takes a bigger more expensive battery we carry tiers of batteries in most sizes a cheapo which you use to sell the car a mid grade which has a little power but a good cold snap will kill them and the expensive one which has more than enough power to electrocute a herd of derps prices vary widely on the size and power the man asks how do you know it wont work i told him the minimum cold crank amps for his truck and pointed out the cheap battery was a good amps lower than that he nods and goes alright he goes off and grabs the one we recommend my coworker looks at me and goes what the eff just happened were so used to people arguing with us it threw us off 
so ive been at my store for about hours and just finished my training classes android wsassy octogenarians not that stressful but definitely sapped of my daily allotment of patience there was supposed to just be one class at pm long story anyway a man approaches me with his wife and a young child hands me a dinosaur and says his cell phone carrier told him i could save his phone he had it in his pocket when it rained it was stuck on a certain screen and they hoped i could reinstall android i may have been able to but his phone was way too old and the official software wasnt available he then asked if i could transfer things around and move him into an existing phone his daughters iphone i said yes he then asked if he would lose anything on the phone she had just passed away months to the day i could see the pain behind his eyes and his wifes eyes were even more telling i told him we would take care of it at that moment id do anything we had to hack past the lock screen with brute force by way of playing questions finally we got in now the apple id password rinse repeat questions and we eventually got it the mother had a very close relationship with her daughter then we went to download google drive to host the files phone required to update to new version hell no so we tried to use a back up from itunes and special software to transfer the data no dice we then tried to use a special machine to transfer the data to my phone no dice both of these things are not supposed to fail finally we realized that my rooted phone was the cause so i pulled a demo phone from my table and used it once we had that we the employees of the store purchased a special usb that had micro and full size usb on it we transferred the data there and created a cloud based account to host the files we handed him the usb and moved the phone numbers to the working devices i lost a few opportunities to sell my products that day four hours about but i won a customer for life yesterday and anyone he tells the story to will probably feel the same way after spending hours with him and learning about how his wife nursed his daughter for two years until her death fuck cancer their daughter suffering while pregnant when they discovered it the poor child granddaughter playing with my kids tablet and the deep set pain in her eyes she got a balloon and two gummy bears the size of your fist from my bribery stash it made me feel emotions that you try to avoid but right now i have an enormous sense of wellbeing tl dr we did a good thing reddit try and find an opportunity for yourselves the interactions arent all bad edit im absolutely flattered right now but im also exhausted they were back today the little girl pointed at a picture of a sunset and said to me that is where mommy is in heaven there is more but i need time to process this soon as i get today unstuck from my eyeballs ill add to the story also thank you so very much for the gold just give me a bit to decompress see you all very soon you magnificent people edit so they came back to see if we could resurrect his the grandfathers original phone to save his contacts i didnt think we could without fixing the os so we tried to find a the stock version of android that goes with his phone couldnt find anything but custom software that other people had made problem was it would wipe the phone if we installed it not helping but it got me thinking why dont we just do that then root the device and use something to recover the files even though they would have been deleted too risky so instead we basically gave the phone cpr we kept forcing a reboot until magically we saw a splash screen i wish i could have released balloons from the ceiling during the process i got to share this post with the family the mother began to cry a little the granddaughter actually was doing her best to cheer me up she was earily okay with mom being healed now i was in awe of her the whole ordeal i will remember for a good long while i want to mention that without the help and support of the other staff i doubt this would have turned out the way it did thanks guys you bet your sweet buns i told them reddit like a lot
a couple of years ago i worked at an office supplies store as a cashier i was doing this to earn a little income while working on my bachelors degree and plus i liked the job and the people i worked with the worst time for our store was during back to school a time when everyone one came in during the tax free weekend to buy school supplies for their special snowflakes it was crazy busy so we had everyone working that day and manning the registers including my managers this one upperclass woman with bleached blonde hair carrying a designer purse came up to the register and threw her stuff down on the counter she then proceeded to toss her coupons at me and told me to run em i smiled through gritted teeth and asked if she found everything okay she proceeded to completely ignore me and text on her phone while her year old daughter stood quietly next to her i scanned the items and then scanned the coupons my computer informed me that one of the coupons was expired so i took a look at it and saw that it had expired a year ago theres no way id be able to override that i politely informed her that i would be unable to apply that particular coupon to her purchase as it was expired she huffed but why its a coupon and you guys should take any coupons that the customer gives you i repeated myself and told her that the items on the coupon didnt even match the items in her purchase and she was visibly agitated at this point let me speak to your manager i dont have time for this crap ooookay i motioned for my manager to come to my register from where he was standing close by and while he was on his way the lady leaned down to her daughter and said in a sickeningly sweet voice see honey this is why you go to college and get an education so you dont have to end up like her working as a cashier holy fuck what did she just say my face turned bright red and the tears starting forming in my eyes as i muttered to her that i was in fact going to college and that this was a part time job at that moment my manager showed up behind me and asked the lady to repeat herself which she stupidly did she had a smug look on her face as she explained that she was the customer and the customer is always right and that she just needed this coupon to be applied i wanted to punch her in the face my manager stood there and looked at her for a few seconds and then began taking all of her already bagged items out of their bags what the hell are you doing the witch screeched slowly and calmly my manager said maam i will not let you stand here and ridicule and abuse my employees i am going to have to ask you to leave we no longer wish to do business with you she stared at us wideeyed and red in the face and then looked behind her to see a long line of customers all looking back at her she sputtered she cried she threw a tantrum her young daughter behaved better than this growass woman it was insane she took her purse and her cards grabbed her daughters hand and stormed out while screaming i am never coming back here again i am going to call your boss and have you all fired do you know who i am my manager chuckled and then told me that i could go take a breather in the back because at that point i probably looked like i had seen a ghost and thats how i learned to stop caring about what customers thought of me or what rude things they said to me
automod why do you hate me so so after several months of aimless training ive finally been given a position as duty manager in my restaurant so far its nothing too special but it has its perks from day one i promised myself i wasnt going to act like the rest of the managers in the store oh my staff didnt lick your boots for you im so sorry ill put them on disciplinary right away and heres a free meal sure thats the easy way to do things but my duty is to support my team and if theyre happy then so am i i know the pain and having worked under that sort of nonsense for a year and a half i decided that enough was enough cue a delightful middleaged gentleman about halfway through a busy shift that also happened to be my first shift run as a supervisor i noticed one of the front counter staff trying desperately to explain something to a customer but to no avail i could tell immediately he had no point to make whatsoever and just wanted to cause trouble for whatever reason at that point i decided to step in gtme sorry is everything okay with your food gtcustomer no its not i ordered chicken and i got a leg gtme so you didnt want the leg piece gtcustomer no i wanted a breast piece why didnt i get that gtme sorry about that did you let the cashier know that you had a preference gtcustomer no why should i happy place happy place happy place gtme sorry sir im happy to change it for you this time but in the future if you just let the cashier know you have a preference then well do our best to accommodate that for you bearing in mind hed already picked up the piece of chicken and waved it in our faces meaning that id have to throw it away and get chewed out by the general manager for wasting product i wrongly assumed i was being reasonably helpful gtcustomer are you able to read oh dear gtme im sorry gtcustomer are any of you able to read what does the menu say i decided to ignore the fact that the item he had ordered wasnt actually specifically listed on the menu boards the item he had ordered has different variations and they were all listed under one name gtme with this you get a piece of chicken and fries gtcustomer so why did i get a leg instead i politely explained to the customer that the chicken is selected more or less at random but that if you have a preference then were more than happy to try and accommodate it thats what was coming out of my mouth but in my mind all i could think was a chicken leg is a piece of chicken gtcustomer your staff should have asked me what i want there is more than one type of snack box right gtme yes there is it comes with either a piece of chicken a boneless piece hot wings or popcorn chicken the cashier would have asked you which one you wanted and you ordered the one piece snack box is that right gtcustomer yes but she didnt ask me if i wanted it to be a breast its not my fault if your staff cant even do such a simple job properly no no you do not accuse my staff of being unable to do their jobs simply because you are a self important idiot who cant even order fast food properly i know my staff well and i know that every single one of them is excellent at their job if you want a custom item you dont expect the cashier to already know about it you wouldnt go to order a burger and expect to be immediately asked if you wanted to take out the mayonnaise but he wasnt finished gtcustomer you need to make your staff ask people what they want and you need to change the menu boards so people actually know what they are ordering this is ridiculous this is just to make sure that first time buyers waste their money your staff obviously dont know how to treat people they shouldnt even be working here i am disgusted and im going to write complaints about every one of them which i expect you to deal with appropriately no more this man was about to receive over a years worth of pent up customer service rage and i almost felt sorry for him gtme sir my team are doing their jobs perfectly and i have complete faith that they will continue to do so you wanted a customised item but didnt specifically ask for it you are now being unacceptably rude to the staff and trying to make them feel uncomfortable to cover up your own error and i will not put up with it you asked for a piece of chicken and you received a piece of chicken as far as i am concerned you are just trying to cause trouble and so i would like to ask you to take your food that i have already changed for you and leave the counter immediately i am done speaking with you and so are my team he stood there dumbfounded for a few seconds realised it was hopeless and promptly stormed off even more shocked were the front counter staff who based on previous experience with managers taking idiotic customer complaints had almost certainly been expecting to be yelled at for this i think i earned their respect that day and i think they finally realised that someone with a manager badge is on their side the rest of the day was great and the team all seemed to work twice as hard as usual this is still all very new for me and i have a lot of doubts as to whether i will be a good manager or not but the one thing i dont doubt in the slightest is that i will stand up for my team every time my responsibilities may have changed but i am not going to stop fighting the good fight edit wow my first gold thank you so much d
edit wow rbestof this really blew up on reddit thanks all ive rewritten the story a bit to clarify some misconceptions this story is told from the perspective of a nave inexperienced spineless angry kid who was having a bad day years ago there are a lot of events that took place that could have been avoided but then this story wouldnt have happened or happened very differently hindsight is and im no longer the angry person i described above just relax and cringe along with the rest of the world as you read this this is an extremely longinvolved story if you skim or skip sections youll miss out on details or colorful descriptions all of it is true and happened years ago its saturday april th i was a part time limo driver working mostly on weekends to pay off my student loans this particular saturday morning i slept through my alarm and completely missed my airport drop off for a vip corporate client my day was starting off really bad but little did i know it would turn out to be one of the worst days of my life in fact ive yet to have one that even comes close to topping it im going to tell it in as humorous way possible because if you cant laugh at your own misfortune who can you laugh at setting the scene am i really messed up by sleeping through my alarm so i arrived hours late to work hoping for the boss to give me another run i am without a shower and soon discovered my top button of my new dress shirt came off add more aggravation to an already sour mood out of on the pissed off scale am boss proceeds to yell and scream at me for minutes on how this was one of his best corporate accounts we might lose it yadda yadda he is normally reasonable but he was having an equally bad day and blaming me for stuff i hadnt even done or was close to being part of since hes so pissed i just let him vent because i deserved it slide back to a out of on the pissed off scale but out of on the guilty and charged scale am the boss makes me clean out several limos for no pay we get paid driving limos cleaning is not driving so no pay and only hints at giving me another run possibly a wedding i know the only wedding left for the day is a pm pickup in the middle of downtown la hour and minute drive due to traffic no way would he give that to me with less than an hour and minutes sure enough the boss still royally pissed at me gives me the worst driver opinion limo on the lot as punishment and i still have to clean up and get it ready to take customers he tells me you better not be fucking late for this and sends me on my way at pm i dont even get a chance to look at the details i think ill do so when i get there pm i arrive at downtown la hotel to pick up groom and groomsmen and take to ucla campus church note im minutes late cause of traffic im peeved but attempt to make the best of the situation out of on the pissed off scale from here there is traffic the entire way to the church near the ucla campus across town because its la and the surface streets are packed because of some event i pull up at pm for a pm wedding phew made it with time to spare for those not near la this trip should have taken edit closer to didthemath minutes when i pull up to the church i get greeted by an irate wedding coordinator aka sneakywc and father of the bride fotb because im late what the hell im trying to explain how traffic works but she is hearing none of it and the father is screaming at me while we are talking i have the fotb sign the contract and credit card receipt and im wondering why she is so hell bent on me being late when ive got mins to spare ive barely had a chance to check the runsheet other than names and destinations but upon a quick glace my scribbled mess of a runsheet says im to wait at the church for the wedding to end then to take them to the restaurant for dinner then the wedding coordinator finally drops the bomb on me you have to go pick up the bride and bridesmaids as well the ceremony starts at pm what hold on a minute no im not its not on the runsheet im pretty sure im not supposed to pick them up yes you are hurry because they are in chinatown thats back in downtown la now i know that i cant leave to do anything unless its on the runsheet hiring a limo means everything is planned out ahead of time a surprise pickup and dropoff point especially for a wedding is practically unheard of and i have never heard of this happening in essence what the fotb and the wedding coordinator are asking me is to add an additional stop on the run this will make everyone and everything late if i was supposed to pick up the bride all along why wasnt this mentioned ahead of time and jotted down on the runsheet the boss would have allotted more time for this did the client mess up did the boss what the heck quick we need to hurry help me attach this traditional chinese to the front of the limo time out hold the phone we have two red flags and now a red bow here first we have two unscheduled pickup and drop off points and second nobody ever messes with the bosses limos ever thats practically rule i glance over the chicken scratch of a scribbled mess that is my bosses handwriting and i notice two words half way crossed out chinese bow edit im thinking maybe the boss changed his mind maybe he forgot to tell me about this bow due to his fit of rage earlier my instincts said i should have called my boss but as he was already ticked off and im apparently late to pick up the bride from an unscheduled pickup best if i left him alone hes just going to say well its a wedding after all go pick them up look my boss doesnt like anyone attaching anything to the limo ive already talked with him about this we dont have time here pop the hood well i guess thats true the bow was mentioned in the runsheet i dont want to give my boss any more reason to execute me for pissing off a client so she herself pops the hood of my limo she then proceeds to tie down this bow as im distracted by an irate fotb who freaking out wondering why it took minutes to get from downtown la to ucla quick answer limousines take longer after sneakywc is finished it looks a little something like only the ribbons are attached under the hood not through the doors like in the photo shes obviously done this before so i leave her to do all the work within a few minutes everything is done and the red bow is tied down firmly to the front of the hood on the trip back to downtown la i noticed the bow is very loose but due to time restraints i dont have time to fix it ish no traffic on the way back thank god and i arrive at the unscheduled stop to pick up the brides party with the mom and grandmother all who are chinese and hardly speak a lick of english obviously we are going to be late but im doing my best to speed things up given the circumstances i know from previous experience that the freeway is jam packed near the so i exit to surface streets at la cienega then jump to wilshire and then to sunset its a driver thing pick routes with less stop signs and traffic lights ish we are on sunset blvd heading west at this point making good time but the arms of this bow are flapping like a wacky waving inflatable tubeman in a hurricane three things happen all at the same time the traditional chinese breaks loose from the front of the car and whips upandover the windshield but still attached at the arms near the wipers the two arm ribbons are hanging on for dear life in the wind and semi blocking my view through the glass within seconds the two ribbons rip from under the hood and instantly all power goes out in the back of the limo its a complete blackout the chinese bow goes sailing into the air and over the vehicle to land in a crumpled heap im left stunned saying to myself whhhhat the hellllll the old crones in the back scream bloody murder in chinese i instantly start to panicyell ahhhhh right along with them hey they surprised me ok through the chaotic madness that is chinese gals screaming i quickly gather that the bow is some sort of family heirloom and must be preserved they demand that i get the bow im to do it not them in the middle of traffic remember the limo is stopped on the side of the street on sunsetfreakingblvd where there is no shoulder to pull over my limo is literally in the middle of the right lane of moving cars i react by putting my hazards on and carefully open my door to cars whizzing by and horns blaring i spot the amp i mean lovely wedding piece and witness it getting run over by a speeding taurus the irony of the red target and the symbolic bull was a lost to me at the time i hold out my hands out in the universally known language of hey im a crazy nutter and proceed to divert mph traffic im playing a living version of frogger through oncoming cars and finally get to this blasted bow i grab the damned thing and notice it has tire marks on the ribbons and parts of it have been shredded from passing cars i angrily toss the thing in the front seat and proceed to get some major squawking from the back now what out of on the pissed off scale no you have to put the bow back on the car chinese tradition cant move without bow being on car well crapinahandbasket so i pop the hood and head back out into traffic curseed bow in hand cars are still honking as they pass and i ignore them i get the front of the bow reattached to the grill as i lift the hood fully i notice a large severed cable near the windshield sneakywc had attached the arms of the ribbons to a thick electrical wire instead of to the frame of the vehicle the wires she used to had literally acted like a sawsaw and sliced it clean through this electrical wire was the power to the back of the limo all lights stereo features and get this ac unit they had no power at all and i had no way of fixing it right now i finish tying off the bow to the frame hop back in drenched in sweat and start the car and wave politely to the passing cop oh sure now you show up thanks for nothing pm arrive at the church mins late to the wedding from an unscheduled pick up that was sprung up on me out of on the pissed off scale im greeted by both the father of the bride and sneakywc i have a few choice words for the wedding coordinator and the brides chinese father who cant believe how slow im driving and wondering why i didnt speed to get there they blamed me for everything that happened yes some of it was my fault some not chewed me out about the neglected pickup the thing with the bow and the fact i arrived extremely late pm the wedding starts horridly delayed and i break

so i was a yr old shift manager at a pizza place and was upset that the only way to make more money was to become an assistant manager and be put on salary and work hours a week one day my boss asked if i would interview a year old girl for a position we had she said she would hire her if i think they would do well i sit down to interview the goth imagine the girl with a dragon tattoo about lbs heavier and more face rings she was wearing a uniform for the fastfood joint down the road the conversation goes something like this so i see your wearing a uniform are you still working for them no i just walked out because they were being dumb being dumb what do you mean by that they were being dumb because they were asking too many questions awkward pause well this is an interview and the purpose is to ask questions so what makes you think you would be a good fit here at pizza place well i like pizza after the interview i decided to hire this girl because she was entertaining and would be a good laugh when my boss had to work with her every day my boss puts in the paper work and hires her without ever seeing her the next day i come into work and my boss is fuming mad the goth showed up with purple hair and more rings in her face my boss told me to deal with it so i go out and tell the goth she has to change when asked why i tell her because she is scaring the customers away the goth busted out laughing she actually went home and changed we put her on prep work in the back to keep her away from people because we quickly found out there was no filter from her brain to her mouth a month goes by and i notice cuts on her arm she always wore long sleeve shirts i asked her about it and she acted like it was no big deal come to find out she was having the typical no one understands me and my parents just dont understand issues most kids have she was just taking it to an extreme i told her what she was doing was wrong and she should talk to someone even if it is a school counselor she actually did it in a sense i became a life coach to this girl for about months she became an invaluable member of the team i helped her filter what she said and to consider others and life was grand about months later i finish up at a jr college and am moving away to go to big people college and its my last day at pizza place the girl pulls me into the back and just begins to sob she says thank you mr webus for giving me a chance when no one else would you saw past the thing i was and saw the woman i could be if it wasnt for you i would not have a job i would not have moved out of my parents house and id probably be dead by now i just wanted to say thank you for hiring me here and for being my friend my heart about imploded on itself i felt so guilty here is this girl pouring her heart out singing my praise because i wanted to troll my boss i hired her as a joke i decided not to tell her i figured i could live with the guilt because not knowing means she feels there is someone in her life that cares fast forward a few years later and im in my profession going out to lunch and i hear mr webusmaster mr webusmaster it was her again her hair was blond apparently she had been dying it black she is the manager of a sandwich shop in the mall going to night classes at college to be a social worker she said she wanted to help others who were in her situation i almost cried felt i would share this with you reddit if the end justifies the means then why do i feel so guilty tldr hired a maniacal goth as a joke and accidentally changed her life

i work at a gasoline station full time and of course we always get weird people rolling through buying their cigarettes beer and cheap hot dogs my job is either to ring them out make food or do tasks around the store i often come to work straight from classes at university so i always change my clothes in the bathroom sometimes to save time i just pull on my work shirt over whatever im currently wearing if its easier to just use my normal clothes as an undershirt this particular day i had come back after a particularly hot day and was wearing some jeans and a tank top i admit my tank top was a bit low cut but i wasnt inappropriate i had walked past the counter on my way to the back when a woman starts grumbling to her boyfriend in line about my shirt just normal stuff like why does she feel the need to dress like that and who is she trying to impress i ignore her and pull on my tshirt atop my tank top and fasten my name badge tie up my hair and walk out to the front after clocking in the help the customers and the lady goes ballistic on me i dont know what got under her skin but she completely bypassed the queue to walk up to my register and starts shrieking at me gtcustomer i cant believe they hired you you just walk in with your tits hanging out and then you expect me to treat you like everyone else now im kind of shocked because woah she got angry after i put on more clothes i stare at her in shock and try to collect myself gtme well i interviewed well how can i help you today gtcustomer you can take your tits and go home i thought this place was more classy than this and without any other words she dropped all her items on my counter and walked out and stood next to the door shouting at other people about the skank behind the counter i just dont understand edited in tldr lady got offended by my excessive amount of clothing says i can take my tits and go home
everybody knows a grinch a scrooge a c montgomery burns somebody who for whatever reason makes it their mission to ruin the happiness of others in normal everyday life we can ignore the scrooges or if theyre particularly horrible just punch them in the face and be done with it but when you have a scrooge for a customer you can unfortunately neither punch nor ignore him such is the case with my stores mr green name edited to protect the innocewell assholish mr green is on the winding down side of a midlife crisis his anatomy has reasserted itself and is slowly but steadily pushing the hairplugs out of his head he seems to have developed a tolerance for diet pills because his spare tire has returned with a vengeance the credit cards he was issued to finance his new childhood are coming up declined more and more and his mustang convertible has ancient birdshit stains on the leather from the numerous times hes parked it without putting the top back on were it not for his pugnacity mr green would be a pitiable fellow mr green comes to our clothing shop at least three times a week always following the same routine on monday he will come in and purchase a lot of clothing on tuesday well get a call from mr green informing us that hes dissatisfied with the clothing on wednesday hell come back to the store to return the items hes dissatisfied with on thursday well get another call in which he insists that one of his many soontobedefunct credit cards was not credited back the proper amount he gives us a day off on friday though we dont know why on saturday hell come back in to argue and haggle with our manager to try to get more money than he is owed week in week out this is how it goes with mr green unto itself this would not be reason enough to hate the man a customer may be very difficult even demanding but that alone doesnt make him an asshole being an asshole about it is what makes him an asshole he has on numerous occasions insulted our staff even using the nword on one of our cashiers when the total of his purchase exceeded his original estimate he parks in handicapped spaces spaces plural he will drive his gross mustang in facing the store laterally whenever hes confronted about it he shrugs saying the sooner im done here the sooner the spaces will be free again chop chop hes been asked to leave several times after sexually harassing female and usually underage customers each time vowing to sue if he was manhandled and he would always get away with all of it because the owner was his best high school buddy that is until recently last week our owner sold out his franchise to the corporate company from which he had purchased the license we the employees had feared this meant that the store would simply close and wed be out of jobs but mercifully teenage hipster clothing store inc decided to keep our location open they promoted one of our floor managers tony who had been called the nword by mr green to the position of general manager and our hourly wage was raised by twentyfive cents suffice to say were all ready to give a salute to our beneficent corporate overlords but the best was yet to come the night before his first shift as general manager a friday and obviously after his promotion had been announced to the rest of us employees one of the guys asked tony what he planned to do about mr green tony already the model of a corporatetype said only just do your jobs like you already do and dont worry about it the next day saturday mr green showed up just like always to try to eke more money than he was owed out of us he parked across the two closest handicap spaces just like always he marched into the store and asked to be shown to the mens section even though he knew where it was by heart but before anyone could even approach tony was already there tony had positioned himself between mr green and the rest of the store proper on the tile foyer directly in front of the automatic sliding doors tony had an object in his hand which i didnt immediately recognize i feared momentarily that it might have been a weapon i couldnt hear what tony said to mr green but the voice with which he said it was low and menacing my fears grew is tony about to shoot mr green mr greens eyes grew wide as tony spoke at first i attributed this to being threatened with bodily harm but i watched the expression grow from one of surprise to indignation what the fuck are you talking about mr green screeched i want to see former owners name right now more rumbled conversation from tony who had begun to draw himself up to his full height of i was now certain that tony was about to murder mr green right there on the tile floor fuck you mr green roared ive been coming here for years you cant just throw me out i havent even done anything at which point tony produced the item he held it in front of his own face and i finally recognized a polaroid camera it flashed as tony held it steady momentarily confusing mr green who then launched into a fullon conniption tony walked away from mr green as he passed by me toward the offices in the back of the store he growled dont let him have shit and make sure he doesnt steal anything not far behind him jogging and allthewhile cursing a blue streak was mr green demanding that picture tony had taken was his property that he had no right etc etc when he got to me i politely interspersed myself between him and the entrance to the office explaining im sorry mr green employees only bullshit he declared trying to walk around me i quickly backed up putting myself direclty in front of the doorway to the offices im really sorry mr green but you cant go back there he looked about ready to body check me at this point so i shrugged and moved out of the way mr green gave me a filthy look as he moved and tried to open the door which was locked mr green began to pound on the door making threats legal bodily and metaphysical he went on like this for about a solid minute before tony opened the door and stepped out mr green steeled himself as tony returned ready for a fight but tony sidestepped him and walked straight to me he handed me a stack of papers each was a flyer which bore the words persona non grata above a photograph of mr green in midtirade put these on all of the entrances and behind every cashiers station tony said speaking slowly his voice an andante bass of angry determination mr green had leaned over to see what it was that tony had handed me and started anew his protestations tony paid him no mind and brushed past him back into the office mr green continued his howling and pounding on the door looking like the big bad wolf if the big bad wolf had let himself go and tried to cover it up with hipster clothing he spied me turning to walk to the entrance and came towards me saying if you put those up i will sue you for defamation of character and discrimination i was unsure of what to do because i dont want to get sued even if its pretty unlikely but relishing the idea of humiliating mr green i was saved from hesitation by an announcement over the stores pa it was tonys voice calmly announcing to the driver of the yellow mustang convertible your car is being towed there was a moment of silence as both mr green and i came to understand what that meant and quicker than ive ever seen him move mr green skittered down the aisle towards the entrance i followed and looked out the large glass doors at the entrance to our store to see mr green hemming and hawing at the towtruck operator who had already begun to load his car into the bed of the truck when i turned around there was tony with a grin a mile wide on his face the same grin which blossomed on my own face we havent seen mr green at all this week and im starting to think that we never will again might be a very good year indeed tldr jerk customer doesnt get what he wants for christmas towtruck driver meets the grinch

hello everyone here is the story of how i will most likely lose my job intrigued background i work as amongst other things as an art gallery assistant we hang shows and sell artwork it is similar to retail in many ways lots of work long hours and people that make you question humanity and its knowledge this weekend i had the job of taking down an art show my boss is gone for the next few weeks so ive been in charge stressful doesnt being to cover it i rent the company van and pick up our interns who are college students looking to gain exp in the field one is trained and the new one lets call him bob is not bob is not there on the way to work he sends a text saying his family is in town and he is not coming in im not happy my boss is expecting me to have all this work done and i need bob because he is the only muscle we have i tell him to come by after he is done eating with his parents if he can bob says okay fast forward to being at work the other intern and i are beginning our shift seeing what pieces didnt sell and those that did bob sends another message saying that he is outside bob then comes in with his girlfriend and entire family his mother then begins to yell at me mom how dare you make my son come into work today when we are in town this is the only day we can see him and you are ruining our brunch me baffled wellmaamyour son has known that he has had to work today for two weeks i saw him two days ago and confirmed that he would be here if you want you guys can go out to eat and drop him off here later i can take him back to his dorm mom no no forget it we are already here were gonna help him so he can leave early me ummyour son is already late for his shift but i can have him out of here by unfortunately i cannot use your help you are welcome to look around or go explore downtown until it gets closer to mom fine i then went back to getting bob started the father stops me to ask an absurd question which i answer in my best retail voice when i hear bob calling for me he is confused on how to get a screw out of the wallwith a hammer bless his heart i take bob to our storeroom where we havewait for ita drill i am explaining how to drill works when i hear a loud crash i run out to find bobs irate mother standing there with a broken sculpture all over the floor i now know what fear and angry feels like when combined in a perfect storm me shaking in rage while giving a meryl streep performance of retail smiles what are you doing with the art mom cannot even see death in front of her im helping my son so he can leave early me you are not allowed to handle the art i can handle it because thats my job and i have been trained intern has been trained today i was going to train your son not you not your husband or daughter or bobs girlfriend but bob you have no right to be handling a piece the guard is located and a report is filed out the parents keep getting in my face and asking me questions until i have to leave and call my boss to report what has happened boss is not happy and as shocked as me tells me to send bob and company away i return to bob and his entourage and tell them to please leave the father spends minutes arguing with me dad what makes you qualified youre just a kid will my son get in trouble will we have to pay for it it said nfs so its like free right how much does it cost bucks me i have held this job for over two years and i have never damaged a piece or had one of the interns damage one i dont know what will happen regarding your sons position or payment for the broken art nfs means not for sale that piece is easily worth it is generally understood that interns dont bring their parents to work nor do pedestrians touch artwork dad oh well haha accidents happen me not on my watch they dont i dont break art and my interns dont break art your wife did however because she had no business touching the work i have spoken with my supervisor and she has said that you all and bob should leave the family then left the mother hiding behind a column and glaring at me the entire time the rest of the day was full of panic and tears on my behalf i will most likely loose my job sorry for the long post and thanks for reading the woes of the gallery assistant edit i was not the one who let bob and co in but the security guard who was at the door playing on his phone edit tldr boss left me in charge of training new employee employee brought entire family to his work idiot mother broke an expensive sculpture awaiting my fate update hey everyone it seems my update reply has been lost in the comments a few users have requested an update so here i am first thanks for all your comments both positive and negative reading them has really helped during a staff meeting a few days ago when boss returned boss spoke with me and bob bob was told he had a strike against him for being late to his shift and was dismissed afterwards boss spent roughly twenty minutes lecturing me how parents should always trump work and how it is not bobs fault but mine since this is his first job and not mine i made it very clear that i had given bob and his parents the option to go bobs mom acted on her own and looking back there was little i could do to stop it nowhere have i ever been allowed to miss a shift for wanting to hang out with my familyespecially last minute i politely said this and that how in many other jobs this type of mindset and behavior would result in termination boss said its better to agree than disagree my job is still intact i have been at my assistant position longer than any of my bosses so i am an asset the artist will get compensated by the gallery insurance
this story reminded me of my time in the copy many moons ago at the copy shop we got our first large format color printer it printed feet wide by about a hundred feet if you wanted to manglement at the time wanted it front and center so customers could ooh and ahh over this new machine and hopefully want something printed this chinese couple came in and asked if we could print a life sized poster of them they had a really nice photo of themselves in front of an old church i did the math and it was about a x print they needed because they wanted to doors to show they also wanted it on glossy paper now heres the problem this first generation printer could print on glossy paper it just took minutes to dry this meant you let the print hang for a bit after it finished so it wouldnt smear so im printing out the picture happy because this thing is going to cost about its about halfway done and im handling several other things when i look over and this little kid walks up to the printer and rubs his hands all over the print as its coming out little finger prints and a couple of smears right in the middle of the print i shoo the kid away and restart the print he of course comes back and is approaching the printer this time i shout at him to back off his parent who is several feet away and not paying attention comes over and demands why im shouting at her kid i show her the ruined print on the counter next to me i tell her that her spawn did that and he was about to do it again she tried to blow it off as no big deal until i told her that if her child ruined the second print i was charging her for both at full price at that point she grabbed her kid by the wrist and basically lifted him off the floor and several yards away from the printer

the finale of an extremely longinvolved story all of it is true of my worst day ever if you missed the first two parts here are the links the chinese wedding epic worst day part the chinese wedding epic worst day part i pull up to the restaurant to my final drop off an hour and minutes over out of on the pissed off scale possibly foaming at the mouth not sure i had been going over the details of the day in my head during the long traffic ridden drive over pretty sure father of the bride fotb wasnt going to pay for the extra hour plus and this added to my wrath i mean i was tricked into putting on a bow that both sneakywc and fotb knew they couldnt put on i was almost run over in the middle of sunset blvd forced to do car repairs on the asphalt in my only good suit made to do an unscheduled pickup knowing full well they should have paid for it id been yelled at insulted my top button on my shirt was broken definitely had to take my suit to get dry cleaned not a happy camper at this moment maneuvering the limo to the side of the curb we are cheerfully greeted by wedding guests all outside waiting to catch the first glimpse of the newlyweds i had been so focused on my inevitable confrontation with fotb that i had neglected to fully grasp just how the groom and bride were doing i hadnt checked on them in a while they had been in the back of a sweltering hot limo with no power for close to minutes with no means to roll the windows down you can imagine what that would do to makeup and hair i open the door to a crowd of cheers only to be followed by oohhhhh and then followed by awkward silence the door in front of me is blocking my view but the bride finally steps out i my face falters as the bride from the limo her makeup was smeared eyeliner dripping down part of her base makeup was stained on her neckline the crowd and i were speechless not only had she been crying but her new husband was worse for wear as he emerged looking like he ran a marathon himself uhh crap what the hell the back of the limo had power why didnt they turn the ac on then it dawned on me when the cable was severed it tripped the circuit breaker to the back panel so apparently they had no ac just hot air blowing during the trip back and they never told me as had rolled the partition up uhhh holy crap was not expecting this the fotb has daggers in his eyes and a face vaguely reminiscent of that dude from big trouble in little he starts to lose it and all his wraith is directed at me what the hell is this you dare treat my daughter this way i demand a full refund ive already experienced the wrath of this man twice today and now i was about to get it again im going to sue you snap i lost it mountain st draidr is about to blow if youve ever heard that expression that someone can get so mad that they see red well i can personal validate that i saw red im so livid im hearing what the smell of red tastes like on the pissed off scale ill leave out the expletives i said during this epic rant because i am pretty sure i was legally insane at this point i spouted off every swear word i could think of then made a dozen more up just for flavor i was so pissed that i was ready to fight all of them and lose in a glorious defeat and i wouldnt have cared fotb balled up his fists and was ready to strike to his credit he didnt and i still have no idea why besides my foaming at the mouth rant and wild arm flailing motions the crowd was stunned into silence the bride was weeping in her grooms arms people from across the streets were stopping to watch pretty sure an open jawed mouthed mother covered her childs ears in horror the fotb stands his ground and with controlled fury and tells me that he will not pay according to him i owe him the cost of the epic screw ups that occurred and reimbursement of the bow uhh what he is going to charge me for ruining the bow after all that just happened he was the one that insisted it be placed on the limo when he was told no in the first place this stuns me back into reality my top had blown my fury ebbed and now i was able to think straight he wants to sue me ohh hell no wait wait wait youre going to sue me im going to sue you i dont give him any opportunity to respond fact you knew you werent allow to put that bow on my limo but you did anyways the boss told you over the phone absolutely no bow but you conspired with the wedding coordinator and blindsided me to put it on you lied period fact your wife and daughter bride made me go out in traffic endangering my life to go get a bow a ing bow the contract states that putting the driver in any danger including life threating situation is grounds of termination of the run i show him the line in the contract he signed fact that bow that you and sneakywc had me put on caused physical damage to this limousine damage that you are responsible for it severed a power line and possibly caused permanent engine damage this speech which i had rehearsed in my head on the way over had me running through lines after lines coherently my throat was sore my voice was shot and my blood pressure was probably off the charts but i was able to get all my points out pretty sure one of the guests whimpered seriously is his face is purple it probably was the bluster from fotb was definitely gone at this point his body had relaxed shoulders less tense as he realized he was up a crap creek and i was the only one giving out paddles with his daughter still sobbing and my own bluster was fading the scene became much more calm and controlled i was still very pissed but fotb wasnt finished with me yet just the shouting match had ended lets talk about this his eyes were no longer looking at me a sign that he knows what i said was true lets negotiate an arrangement in price the dude was negotiating with me in front of guests his weeping bride of a daughter and a stunned crowd still gathering no attempt to take me aside or speak oneonone i was floored honest to god stunned at his gall negotiate whats to negotiate it was your negotiating that started this whole thing you didnt want to pay my company the bucks for the extra pick up which caused the wedding to start late in the first place then you didnt want to hear no for an answer with the ing bow being put on the car i let my words hang there for a bit and then said the thing i regretted to this day i wish i could have taken them back true or not right or wrong there are just some things you shouldnt say i have no excuse for my words and the events of this day are certainly not ones ill use it was your cheapass who caused all of this to happen you didnt want to pay extra or hire another limo company that would allow a bow to be placed on the front probably because you were too cheap so all this happened you famping ruining your daughters wedding do you know that the shock of what i said caused the crowd to avert their eyes and move away this was a low blow i should have just taken his attitude like a man should have let the boss handle all of this should have done a lot of things but i let my anger control me most of the guests went inside and others kept their distance and the bridegroom vanished to wallow in reception pity fotb had tears welled up in his eyes and his body was shuddering from the pain of it my heart sank i just officially ruined his daughters wedding and insulted a proud man in front of his family and relatives all of my anger was gone vanished with the sight of this broken man who realized he royally screwed up i croaked through a weak apology but it was too little too late the damage was done we calmly discussed some business things and he agreed not to press any of the issues with the limo nobody was suing nobody i told him i would do my best in controlling my boss but if there was permanent damage there was nothing i could do about it as we parted ways he actually shook my hand uhh what he shook my hand after that epic meltdown are you crapping me wait bucks in my hand he tipped me holy crap the guy actually tipped me after all this my mind was swimming in what the hell just happened thoughts and i hazily make my way to the car i dial up my limo buddy and proceed to explain everything in as much detail as possible im still on the phone as i pull into the nearest gas station to clock out i put the nozzle in start to fill the tank and continue talking in animated detail im wandering around as i talk being pumped full of adrenalin and all when i notice something i burst out laughing and my poor friend is wondering wtf is going on i cant breath im laughing so hard tears are actually welling up in my face and im coughing to get air in my lungs through bursts of laughter the bow its still on the front of the car edit just the cut up ribbons were in the back the headpiece had never been removed from earlier epilogue the boss was told this story in full gory detail a few days later after he calmed down i gave him the bow for him to deal with if the client was to press any issues we never heard from the fotb the bride or groom again and they never called to claim the remains of their heirloom the bow however became something of a legend at my old work as the story got passed from driver to driver i ended up keeping the remains of the bow after enough time had passed in lost and found i ended up losing it in a move a while back and now im attempting to find an old photo i took of it no luck so far as i might have left it in the same box as the bow in the end the boss was still pissed at me for about a month but as there was no permanent damage other than the severed cable he eventually let it go ive told this story hundreds of times to friends and family and it gets retold just about every christmas to anyone who brings someone new it brought a lot of anger and pain to me for a while but i matured and grew a backbone i can now laugh at my misfortune because i cant change the past only learn from it special note if you are or somehow know the chinese couple who this story is about please tell them this please accept my humblest apologies for all that happened this day now you know my side of the story and i hope to hear from you again over a beer if you are ok with it i am truly sorry for all that happened that day i wish you two the best of luck wherever you are and my deepest sympathy goes out on your behalf thanks for taking a journey with me on the worst day ive ever had thank you for the gold whoever you are

i only had the pleasure of overhearing this conversation part way through because i noticed a loud voice and rude tone all of a sudden but basically the other day a guy came into our store questioning why he wasnt phoned back for an interview when he applied over a week ago and our job posting is still online my supervisor tells him that we get a high volume of applications and if my store manager who is in charge of hiring decides to hold an interview he will call to schedule a time gtapplicant i need a job im here right now telling you im ready willing and able to work and youre just throwing me out the door gtsupervisor they need to look over your application and theyll let you know sir gtapplicant how will they know who i am gtsupervisor did you include your name and number on your application gtapplicant yes but i want it to be known that im here now ready and able to work gtsupervisor i can get you the store manager if you like since he oversees the hiring gtapplicant no his voice gets quieter but he starts pointing and doing weird hand gestures at my supervisor she concludes saying she will take a physical copy of his resume since he has it with him and forward it along to my store manager he wasnt happy with this gives her a few more comments showcasing his anger and walks out of the store he walks right by me to the door and says gtapplicator what a jerk i cant believe this fucking stupid place and hes confused why he doesnt have a job you dont harass employees into giving you a job sir 
upfront apologies for any grammar or spelling mistakes i work in a large thrift store about miles outside of birmingham al its a christian run organization that has several ministries that it gives to and the one we give to helps battered women and children each location has its own that it gives to i think last year is was somewhere around of our net profit that we gave them several million dollars easily and while i am not christian i love what the store does and the people who work there are awesome now on to the real meat of the story our basic operations is run through donations people can come to the store and drop off their junk where its taken to the back weighed counted processed graded labeled and then finally put onto the sales floor one piece of clothing will pass between four to five people before reaching the customer and we also do what we call specials which is when we send our trucks to your house to pick stuff up mostly furniture now when all is said and done we have invested labor space time and fuel into getting these items to sell at our store but this is semi rural alabama to say people are cheap would be charitable and there is always someone who wants to haggle and barter we dont do either and they will throw out a line like but you got it for free nono we didnt but out of all of those times i have been told this one in particular sticks out and still makes me rage a little i was helping out the front end while the main lady was taking her break no big deal its not busy we have all our cashiers in and there hasnt been many calls for specials overall a pleasant morning that is until miss alabama walks up to the counter decked out in houndstooth and red carrying a very nice handbag with a such a sour expression on her baboon ass lips that you might begin to wonder if baboon ass wasnt what she was tasting in her hand she is holding a small statue that i had helped my assistant manager research online just that morning it was a smallish sculpture by some famous artist that was worth a good it depicted a man being held up by angel jesus set on a wooden base campy and old but we are firmly planted in the buckle of the bible belt jesus sells here we had a sticker on it for i smile and ask her if there was anything i could do for her and she immediately snaps a quick yes there is tell me how can you charge so much for something that yall got for free it took me a moment to formulate an answer we price our items based on their value well its missing a finger yes jesus did not have a right index finger anymore thats why its only thats outrageous and look at it its dirty oh the dirt is free it was a bad attempt at making her smile or at least bring the reigns in a bit but no dice if anything it just pissed her off more this is a thrift store not an antique shop you cant sell other peoples junk and charge this much we do give half of what we make to charitys name and they have to pay us somehow im not paying thirty dollars for a broken knick knack thats actually insert name of piece by artists name one just like it sold on ebay for last week ive long since forgotten both pieces of information baboon lips intensify and her eyes narrowed now i know her scheme we have plenty of people who come to buy stuff and resell it on ebay its not new we dont discourage it and in fact most of them are valued customers one guy ill call joe comes in and buys up to worth of shoes at a time to repair and resell hes awesome this lady i dont like her ill give you sorry our prices are firm well then i dont want it she plants the statue down on the service desk and stands there expectantly alright i said and put it in the go back box her face morphed through several varieties of indignant rage before she marched off the regular service lady returns from lunch and i am free a few minutes later i see miss alabama walking around with the statue again and she approaches the floor supervisor the floor supervisor is a sweet older lady who is devoutly christian but with just enough sass to make her one of my favorite coworkers this didnt have a price on it she says sweetly how much would you say this is i found it over near the knick knacks so much lies but ive been in retail long enough to know going up there to declare her a liar is all forms of nope so i just sit and listen oh yes i remember this piece such beautiful work you know i love me some jesus she says this all the time but its still funny when she says it to customers too bad its busted and so dirty so ill say she hummed and thought about it for a few seconds before turning back to the lady and saying the face of miss alabama baboon lips was so delicious she looked like she wanted to start in on the floor supervisor the way she did me but bit back her bile and simply said ohwell thank you she marched up to the register and by the time she got up to check out the original sticker had miraculously returned i waited till she had left before going up to my supervisor and telling her about what had transpired between miss alabama baboon lips and myself oh i know best way to get people trying to scam you out of paying the sticker price is to quote them a higher one when the sticker goes missing if theres one thing i wont tolerate its stealing from those trying to do gods work tldr have you found jesus yes hes down at the thrift store for 
so i work at an internet cafe basically its an internet gambling place you sign up give me money and it goes onto your account which turns into points you can play these slot machine like games on a computeras well as search the internet but no one does that when you win points from these games you can come up to me and redeem the points for cash or use the winnings to continue to play the games first off let me say we do not have a tip jar no one is ever expected to tip us nor do i expect anyone to us no matter how big they win there is nothing asking for tips or any sort of extra money for us as were already getting paid we are allowed to accept tips if the customer gives us one which for me is awesome there are very few tippers that come through my store but when they win big they tip typically depending so diner lady comes through my store every day shes not a bad customer but i know her because she works at my favorite diner and typically leave her a goodabout half my bill tip since the diner is incredibly cheap so a huge meal for is only a good tip on that would only be i can only imagine how hard it is living off tips when you have children this is assuming they get tips since ive noticed most people dont tip in my area i mean i know all those tips probably end up in my hands anyway so i dont know i still like to tip two days before this story takes place i had given her a tip on a a tip anyway today dl comes in puts on her normal and plays she wins really big and comes out with wow great for her she hands me a and says thats for you i am always grateful for tips wow really you know you dont have to thank you so much i really do appreciate it i always try to make sure they know how much i do appreciate being tipped since i dont really do anything that warrants a tip she puts another on her account and keeps playing she looses that and puts more on and more on and more on so on and so forth till i have her entire back but she continues to play easily another after that thats when she comes up to me looking nervous dl so princesshoneybunny do you think you can put on me sure and i wait and i wait and shes just looking at me me im am going to need that before i put it on your account dl oh well i was hoping you could put that i gave to you on me what dl i mean i just want my money back is that okay i have quite a bit of freedom at my job especially to turn away customers when theyre being rude or if we think their bad for business so i can really say whatever i want with in reason me you know you didnt have to tip me that was up to you dl listen i just want my money back theres no reason to guilt trip me all i did was change my mind i dont want to sound like a bitch but thats my fucking money and i want it she always whispers bitch this isnt the first time shes said i dont want to be a bitch me okay okay ive got it right here its no problem i understand now i was pissed i give her great tips all the time at least once a week amounting to much more than this and this was the first time she had tipped me even though shes won much more before i never expected her to tip me i genuinely like giving good tips since i know it can make a servers day much better when theyve been getting crappy tips all day but as i said tips are up to them and not expected at all and if she wants it back then she can have it back i reached into my wallet and pulled out me here you go dl i gave you this is only wheres the rest of it me i took my tip back the one i gave you sunday all i did was change my mind right she looked at me gaping and then left bonus this morning i got up early get some breakfast at the diner since my so was leaving for a week and we wanted to grab some food before his flight i asked for another waitress todayi know most of them by name now dl saw the big tip i left for her coworker i think the best part of this whole story is that she still came in and played todayshes here right now except now she barley looks at me

theres a tldr at the bottom i dont put them on top because it feels like spoilers this is a story from many years ago i have since quit this job and gotten a bit wiser in hindsight what i did could have cost me the job but it was worth the satisfaction at the store i worked there was a policy that the person who is the lead cashier for the night is also responsible for restocking the candy we would get peaks and lows in the customers wanting to check out if there were no customers around we were expected to do the restocking at this point in the night there was a small surge of customers myself and my coworker are ringing them out and i have a box of candy sitting near my register because i was the lead cashier that night a small family approaches me mother grandmother and two young children big sister and little sister while mother is unloading her basket of items grandmother goes to sit on a bench near the store exit little sister and big sister chill out near their mother for a bit while hanging out big sister grabs a piece of candy from the box i had open and pockets it into her jeans no one besides me sees her do this big sister and little sister go to sit on the bench with grandma at this point im conflicted the child is old enough to know what she did and young enough to be whipped into shape by being caught plus i like my job and she just stole from my store right in front of me i decide to take action as i am checking out her items i casually ask the mother is that your child with the brown hair sitting on the bench when the mom replies yes i dropped my bomb can you please have her pay for the candy she just took my coworker told me later that it went silent after i said that mother wants to assume the best so she calls over big sister and says this lady said you just took a piece of candy without paying for it big sister no i didnt me its in the front right pocket of her jeans grandmother reaches into the pocket and pulls out not only the piece of candy but about other small items from around the store that big sister had picked up while wandering around mother went livid she told the child that they were returning all the things she had bought for her that day and that she would be in trouble when they got home as big sister cried i handed the mother her receipt it was satisfying to see the kid so upset over getting caught since i cared more about scaring the kid straight then i did about a piece of candy tldr called a kid out for shoplifting her mother decides to punish the child instead of talking to my supervisor about my behavior 
 so three days ago i had a young woman come through my line trying to buy some items with a check it was not hers and declined it she asked me why and i explained it to her she apologized and was very understanding as the reason why she said she needed the stuff so she was going to call her dad who was who the check belonged too well about minutes passed and her dad showed up he was not as understanding he starts off with trying to say he has done this before i told him i was following procedure and was not allowed to accept a check from someone whos name was not on the check i begin to rescan all the items while the man made snide comments about me not accepting the check such as there last names are the same and there addresses are the same and i just replied that last names does not mean direct family and the person had a common last name also i never got as far as checking her id since the check had his name on it it was that simple as i finished scanning he handed me the check i denied and i asked for his id he then decided to blow up and make a scene he started screaming at me and calling me several names i looked at him and just told him he needed to calm down well as usual that just makes them even madder he continues on and my supervisor takes notice he comes over and i did not have to tell him what was happening as the guy was screaming about what i did asking for his id the supervisor takes over and the man gives my supervisor the id he runs the rest through and the man storms out screaming he was going to talk to my manager the next day i get into work and my manager calls me to his office the man was true to his word except he went a step beyond he called our corporate office the manager asked me about what happened and i told him what happened i did not accept the check from the woman and asked for his id the man was causing a scene the supervisor took over and he said he was going to tell you about me well corporate sent down to my manager that proper procedure was followed and requested investigation to see if i had done anything wrong the supervisor was asked about the situation and i was in the clear about half way into my shift the man walked into the door and sees me at the counter he an agitated grunt and storms by minutes later i hear him hollering unfortunately i could not understand what he was hollering but then a few minutes later the manager showed up and told me the guy was mad because i was not fired we began chatting and he stopped suddenly as he had a call on his earpiece he left in a hurry a few minutes later he came through with security and they were walking him out of the store my manager stopped by on his way back through and told me he was screaming at some customer and one of our ladies in deli because the woman was waiting on an order and the man did not want to wait the manager asked me if i would write out what happened with me for some paper work and he got the customers information he was going to have the man served a no trespass order i wonder how that is going to work out for the person who serves him 
long time lurker of this subreddit first post etc i actually have a pretty decent story to share so some background i work in a electronics retail stor we offer accidental damage coverage plans on almost everything including cellphones this tale actually begins about half an hour before my shift i arrived to work early in my normal civilian clothing and am eating my lunch in the break room a coworker who specializes in watching cameras to ensure people arent stealing comes in the break room laughing gt nicolxc youll never believe what just happened i was watching the cameras focusing on this one girl who i thought was trying to steal an expensive phone case but she did something so much better my coworker goes on to tell me that this girl was looking at those fancy phone cases that are supposed to protect your phone if it drops or gets submerged in water and all that stuff she already had one on her phone but i guess she wanted to see the other ones we had a guy came over and started talking to her and she begins to demonstrate the case functions using her phone as an example she then lifts the phone above her head and smashes it into the ground when she picks it up she realizes that her phone screen is shattered and it is not turning on so she begins to cry so she gets in line to be helped with her phone so coworker is telling me this and because im still in normal clothes i decided im going to carefully look at some things around the line shes waiting in when i walk near her she is sobbing uncontrollably eventually one of my coworkers is available to help her and i could only get bits and pieces of the conversation but it started off with her saying she dropped her phone coworker knew of the situation beforehand he then asked her if she had any sort of protection plan on it she answers no but that she just bought it a couple of months ago and paid for the total cost of the phone coworker says that unfortunately there is nothing we can do phones we are not allowed to exchange outside of the first days so if it were a defect you would have to go through the manufacturer but because it is a cracked screen they will not cover it the lady does not like that she looks at my coworker and goes gtim going to sue you and this entire store for this coworker just replies gt alright but we do have a video of you smashing the phone into the ground she looked he had slapped her but immediately turned and walked towards the manager manager says gtdont bother i heard and saw the entire thing lady just walks out end edit this is my most popular post ever thank you guys your stories are making my lunch break even better

i no longer work in retail but whenever we get closer to the holidays i always think of this experience i used to work a a big box electronics store and every year like clockwork someone comes in a hour before the store closes on christmas eve asking for a new ds or ps or whatever clearly the store is picked dry and i get to help this dumass waiting until the last moment when i tell them we are sold out the next words out of their mouth always astound me you just ruined my kids christmas now by this time i am tired of christmas and all the people that really do not make it the most wonderful time of the year thankfully our managers turned the other way in these scenarios and allow us to respond excuse me i didnt ruin anything you did by waiting until the last moment now is there anything else i can get you today by that time they ask for a manager and they ask the same question and annoyed and upset that we cant make one appear out of thin air they storm out to try and terrorize another innocent worker edit my highest rated post on reddit ever and i have a spelking error in the title p gtgt
i used to work in a local store that was kinda like a big box store only smaller last week the owners decided to do a off everything in the store promotion but they didnt go about it the best way first they didnt tell the employees about it until it was happening and customers were yelling at us about not getting their off also they didnt put any extra people on staff because they didnt realize how crazy the store would get usually on a hour shift i might get people total at my register last week i was on register for straight hours with people coming through no break and no slowing down of customers so of course things were crazy all over the store stuff was a mess so the owners were asking everyone to work ot some people were able to work lots of ot and wanted the money but i could only work a little ot because im a single mom my shifts were all arranged around my kids school days and activities on halloween night one of the owners asks if i can work ot that night and i said no because i was going to take my kids trickortreating she begged me but i said im sorry its their favorite holiday and im not going to make them miss it also many of my young single coworkers who were with me told the owner they could stay till closing so they had lots of extra hands on deck yesterday i walked in to start my shift and the owner told me to come to her office then fired me officially she said they need someone more dedicated to the store and cant have me putting other things before my work im pissed off because money is going to be really tight for awhile but no store is more important than my kids update wow didnt expect so many responses i applied for unemployment this morning and im pretty sure ill get it i did some online research and in my state they can fire you without warning for any reason i dont think i can sue because its not illegal i will call the labor board to double check good news is that the daycare center i used to work it has an opening my old boss is still there and she said shed be happy to take me back i have to do a formal application and everything but im pretty much a shooin plus free daycare for my kids
ive been working at a grocery store as a cashier since march and was recently promoted to customer service manger with the new year being both male and still in high school doesnt fit the coincidental precidence that had been placed at our store for csm but many of the customer are already used to it due to the fact that most of them are regulars but there was one customer just call him joe who had a hard time accepting it i get a phone call for the bakery and since our bakery was closed i told joe that i would take the order for him it was a king cake and we ship them across country for those who cant enjoy them in their own states joe oh the bakery isnt open me no sir but i am more than capable of taking your order joe can you get a manager to do it i know i have to pay over the phone and it has to be shipped so i just want it to go right me i am the current manager on duty joe no you arent and then he hung up about thirty minutes later i am helping out a new cashier at one of the registers when i heard someone ask for the customer service manager and heard them directed towards me i left the register and greeted the man and recognized his voice joe hi i was on the phone earlier and i wanted to make a king cake order but i wanted a manager and they wouldnt get one me that was me i am the front end manager joe no you arent where is your supervisor i called my supervisor and the guy asks to make a king cake order my supervisor responds by pointing to me and saying thats his job he is the front end manger after my supervisor leaves the guy looks at me joe ill do the order tomorrow after work little does he know that im the manager on duty for the next days guess hes not getting a king cake ordered edit mistype 
so this story takes place when i worked in the garden center of a large grocery store we were able to process all transactions through our register so many people would come to check out here as the line tended to be shorter this was all fine and well except for one thing when people brought items with electronic security tags we were unable to deactivate them as our portable scanner had been left in the rain and ruined this meant that any time an item with one such tag was purchased the security gate would go off and we would simply wave the person through as we had just checked them out on a day in which the alarm had gone off several times i decided to discuss it with my manager gtme so is there any way we can get a new security tag scanner im tired of hearing the alarm all day gtmanager weve decided it isnt cost effective to replace it since you people keep leaving it in the rain you deserve to have to listen to this all day and when we finally get a new one maybe you wont take it for granted this set me off a bit as i had not even been employed when the the original scanner was damaged i went to a party with my friends that night and began to vent about how dumb my boss was i told everyone how we were going to end up losing more money from theft because it was so easy to steal from us all someone would have to do is actually purchase one item with a security tag and stuff their pursebag with other items when the alarm went off the cashier would assume it was due to the purchased item and wave them through after two days off i walk back into work and see we have a brand new security tag scanner sitting on the counter gtme so you decided to get us a new scanner after all gtmanager yeah we had hundred of dollars worth of stuff stolen this weekend from electronics lp thinks they were simply buying an item or two through here and stuffing their bags since we have been waving people through the alarms gtme ohyou dont say oops 
customer was dawdling and we were getting ready to close we cant say anything to them until a decent amount of time after weve actually closed its minutes past closing time theyre still shopping manager approaches customer gtcustomer i know youre closed but im almost done picking out my tupperware gtmanager were closing the registers so if youre going to purchase please do so in the next minutes our employees need to go home to their families gtcustomer you work retail you chose this job you gave up the rights to have a family or spend time with them if you want family time get a real job what just what also she had spent quite literally over hours looking at tupperware we have shelves of it i dont even know anymore 
ive been out of the retail game for a while but reading shoplifter stories reminded me of a very satisfying encounter that happened just before i left for my next job our store had very little theft our inventory always came in within of what was expected making us the best in company stores best store got bonusesprizesfree product so we took the theft that did occur very seriously fortunately we only had one thief shes about and apparently has a passion for socks and sandals weve never caught her fully redhanded but weve come very close so since we couldnt ban her we would just follow her around and watch her closely until she left occasionally she would bring a friend to try to distract us in which case two employees would team up a week before i started my nonretail job i saw her for the last time while i followed and watched her she turned sharply and asked why are you always right behind me nobody else gets treated like this i replied stonefaced nobody else is dumb enough to steal socks she turned white and immediately bolted according to my old coworkers they havent seen her since this remains one of my most satisfying moments in retail update one of my old coworkers is on reddit and saw this apparently she was arrested from shoplifting for a nearby store about four months ago

hello everyone first time poster long time yada yada on to the story during my junior and senior years of highschool i worked at a fast food place in my home town working there for two years i have a lot of stories but today ill tell you about the guy who almost got beat up over a milkshake on this particular night i was working on the front counter which included making all the fried items taking orders cleaning the lobby carrying out food etc its a pretty slow night maybe three tables occupied one of which is occupied by my parents they liked to come in and eat with me at work once a week or so theyre awesome so im behind the counter stocking and cleaning up when a man and woman come in probably late s early s i dont see any alarm bells on them besides the womans resting bitch face but plenty of cheery folks have that anyway they order and the woman wants to substitute a shake in place of her drink this is fine except that she only wants the medium size shake while her meal comes with a large seeing as the meal comes with a large shake i can give her a medium but cant refund her the price difference this is roughly how that goes me me dl dumb lady dh dumb husband gt dl ill take a but i want a chocolate shake instead of the drink but instead of the regular size it comes with can i get one size smaller instead gt me certainly but you should know that even if i give you a medium size shake i cant refund you the price difference so you would still be paying for the large shake gt dl really thats pretty stupid why do i have to pay for the large shake if im only getting the medium one gt me im sorry maam thats just the way the company does it gt dh thats stupid were not gonna pay for a larger shake and only get a smaller one gt me okay so you just want to stick with the regular large shake then gt dh no she wants the medium size just give it to her and give us the fucking difference now remember how i said my parents were there well my dad who is a rather large and intimidating looking man decides hes had enough of some jackass yelling at his son d will be my dad gt d stands up with his trademarked death glare look you son of a bitch thats my son and if you raise your voice at him again im gonna kick your ass at this point the man woman myself and the other guests in the lobby are all in complete silence with my dad staring at this man after about seconds of this the woman quietly says shell take the regular sized shake they hand me the money and immediately leave after getting their food without a word i never saw them again in my years there

long post tldr at the bottom ive been working in a large retail company for the past years or so over the time ive had a lot of scenarios where the customer is always right when they are absolutely not this is one of them i should preface this by saying the company i work for has a policy of instore credit for returns without a receipt if you have the initial receipt you can cash out the voucher if you cant find anything but without that receipt it is exchange only whilst its usually used instantly to replace an item the customer has a month window to spend their credit which is usually enough time given we sell everything from apparel to homeware to confectionary to toys after that time the note is nullified and cannot be used in a transaction and we have no means to override that earlier this week i was placed on registers during a weekday it can be pretty quiet mostly stayathome parents and elderly i probably served people every minutes or so for the majority of my shift i had a middle aged lady walk to my register and without being able to get a word in she slammed her item a bag of chocolate coated liquorice onto the counter i proceeded with the standard how are you doing today did you find everything you needed have you got a loyaltyrewards card with us speech and was warmly greeted with a im paying with this waving a credit note in my face a little weird for a bag of chocolate but no big deal shell just have left on the credit note i scan it through and complete the transaction i then notice that the credit note says that it expires in two days me i should probably tell you this is going to expire in a few days if you want you can go and find something worth and refund it back to give you another voucher customer why would i do that ive just bought something with this so i have another months to use it all me no that isnt how it works you have months from when you returned items for the credit note spending a portion of it wont extend that time customer i know what im talking about ive done this before at this store i figured she may be right so i quickly confirmed it with my supervisor who told the customer and myself that there is no extension and the remaining balance will expire the customer at this point was getting louder and more aggravated and started telling us both that she knows what she is talking about me are you sure you dont want to just grab any items and we can do a quick purchase and refund that way you dont lose your store credit not exactly something we should do or usually offer but its a fair amount of money about to go to waste so we tend to make exceptions on that customer fine refund the chocolates then me that thats not how it works customer you said that you can just do a refund refund the chocolates me all that will do is give you a voucher that expires in months youll still have on the other that expires in a few days customer i dont care i know what im talking about just refund the choclates at this point my supervisor and i shared a look of disbelief that somebody could be that confused and told me that i should just do the refund like the customer has asked so i did i gave the lady a voucher and told her to have a lovely day all the while reminding her that her other voucher is still close to becoming worth less than the ink on the paper she left the store calling me useless not the best insult ive had this past fortnight cue todays shift i was fortunate enough to serve the lady again who was a lot more pleasant today this time buying a near trolley load of clothes which funnily enough totalled to she handed me two credit notes i couldnt help but let out a quick smile and chuckle to myself i looked at them and there was a note and a now expired i scanned the first which went through fine scanned the which immediately prompted on the screen expired cannot process i knew that from here the pleasant transaction would turn me unfortunately i cannot put this one through because it has expired customer what do you mean i was here earlier this week and i used it so i have another months me i did tell you that it doesnt work that way and i tried to have you quickly purchase something so we could refund you another credit note there is nothing i can do now that it is expired customers where is your supervisor i want to speak to them so i call my supervisor over who is luckily the same person as my first shift and remembers how everything went the first time after being shouted at for what seemed like seconds my supervisor calmly says maam we explained to you earlier that the voucher will expire and that you had an opportunity to receive a new note you told us you knew what you were talking about and now there is nothing that we can do the credit note is null and void you need to pay for the rest of the transaction or leave and get your credit note back the lady shouted several obcenities in our direction before leaving the store without her credit note she lost there is always one person that thinks they know the job better than those who work it there is only so much so can offer to those people before i let them have their way even if its wrong tldr customer had expiring credit note gave her option to purchaserefund an item for a new credit note didnt take it and loses

so there was this terrible cashier at a grocery store i worked at not work ethic he always showed up on time volunteered to work more hours he was just a bad cashier years old had been hired to bag groceries for some reason they decided to make him a cashier when they were training him he could never run the checks properly every single time hed end up having to grab another cashier or a manager to finish the transaction xenu forbid that the receipt tape run out that would be a complete fiasco with him fiddling with the paper until someone with the bare minimum of patience would show up and push him out of the way to do it properly he would freeze when confronted there was a big biker dude who didnt appreciate only getting back for his pack of cigarettes the biker may have been highdrunk i wasnt really paying attention but the cashier just stood there while the guy flipped out the store manager came to the front and tossed the guy out of the store without the smokes if this dumbass cashier could manage to explain how math works that situation could have been handled much better his tills were always over dont know how hard it is to make correct change when their is a screen showing you the exact amount to hand over then one day he got so stressed out by the line he accidentally gave away a full grocery cart away the people tried to pay and he said that they already had the managers finally figured out that this simpleton might not be cashier material and sent him back to bagging also this cashier was me i had jobs after that i used registers and never had issues grocery store lines frazzled my young nerves along with counting tills damn money

im a manager for a high volume national drug store chain i usually can quell any disagreements at the register fairly easily when wearing my shirt and tie once a week on our truck day i ditch the shirt and tie and opt in for the more comfortable drug store shirt people are so much more combative dismissive and much more likely to not even acknowledge me in aisles upon me greeting them given the current retail climate of get your scores up or youre in deep trouble ive found it has helped me tremendously when dealing with low survey scores to not immediately point the finger of blame at my colleagues but rather acknowledge that sometimes a person just cant be reasonably pleased i wish more managers would do the same and work on the front lines a little more i have found the experiences invaluable in my growth

so i work the register for a fast food chain about a month ago i was put on am to pm shift which i dreaded because lunch was super fucking busy at our branch due to it being located next to a shopping center and a middle school anyway ive been hating life since the new shift because of the non stop abuse from rude customers and parents who think they own you with their spoiled little brats who throw tantrums when the toys in the kids meal that they want arent available but what gets me the most is these asshole high schoolers that come up order a kids meal and try to draw a reaction from me like they want me to gowut lol a kids meal but youre not a kid this is so random lolol i hide my rage with a deadpan mask aint giving them the satisfaction i treat it like any other transaction because it really isnt funny to anyone but them and the friends who watch them do it but this storys not about them today as my shift was ending it was particularly quiet one kid comes in and he looks probably or wasnt sure at first cuz he was pretty tall but the skinny body and acne was a giveaway of his youth he comes up and asks for the kids meal and asks for a specific toy one of the birds from rio in my mind i go ugh another one of these but something was not right there wasnt a group of snickering friends behind him or any trace of trolling in his face so i ring it up he gets his order and goes to sit and i think nothing more of it i was staying overtime and there were only about tables occupied so i decided to start clearing up some of the messier ones i notice the skinny guy is sitting in the corner booth staring at his phone and not touching the meal i get closer to him as i clean up each table and when im next to him i cant help but notice that hes crying not like sobbing or anything but his face was flushed bright red and hes constantly wiping tears and snot off his face between fiddling his phone now i dont have a bleeding heart for strangers but this guy looks really helpless so i ask him whats up just so you know i am absolute shit at comforting people so this was roughly our back and forth gtme hey are you alright gthim no gtme was your meal uh not satisfactory gthim i was supposed to meet my sister here its her birthday and i wanted to give her this bluebird forgot the name because she loves this movie gtme aw that sucks man yeah being stood up is never fun its alright im sure youll get another chance to give it to her gthim our parents are separate and theyre keeping us apart we meet here some days because she walks home from nearby primary school and her mom doesnt want her to see me or my dad incoherent mumbling drive all the way here on her birthday gtme sorry man listen youre a great guy and i hate to see you down on your luck anything i can do to help he keeps on and on about hes texting her and apparently his sisters mom found out theyve been meeting secretly and decided to drive her to and from school so she doesnt get another chance from what i gather its his step sister because he never refers to the mother as mom always her mom and he says that he and his dad are trying to keep in touch but the mom is having none of it what a mess i ponder asking him to describe her to me so i could maybe give her the toy if i ever see her we get a lot of students from that school but i did not like the idea of approaching grade schoolgirls in the off chance that id find the sister so i could try give her a toy as a favor her brother asked me like thats not totally creepy im already a minimum wage earning loser that has no social life im not going to be pegged as a pedophile too i sat with him for a while and he tells me about how they always got along and their parents used them as pawns in their sham of a marriage and he and his sister always felt like they only had each other like i said im shit at comforting people so all i could ask was if he had anyone to talk to about it because i sure as hell wouldnt be able to help much he says no and i end up giving him my mobile number and getting back to work because my super was giving me the death glare of why the fuck are you sitting down with a customer and i think that if i can help this guy even a little bit it could make a world of difference i tell him to text me if he ever needs someone to talk to hours since i got off my shift and i still havent heard from him im sorry if this is a downer i realize as im typing this that there really isnt an ending here but today i realized how trivial my misery was just working at a fast food chain is shitty in itself but its a situation i put myself in didnt do well in school halfassed attitude in college having no ambition but this fucking kid is in a world of hurt and he doesnt deserve any of it i lurk this sub a lot and i often see posts about being depressed or feeling like shit because of their job but in the end its just a job you can quit you can try to do better its not like this guy who has family life crumbling right before him im lucky to have my parents to call or my brother when i feel like venting out the misery of my job but what do you do when youre life is miserable instead of just your job that was a lot longer than i wanted it to be just a lot of thoughts circulating my head right now definitely going to call my parents tonight thanks for reading edit glad this is getting through to a lot of people i was just happy to get this out of my system edit please dont take the self depreciation in my words too seriously i am really okay and this recent event has given me a wake up call but still thanks for all the encouragment edit thank you for the gold and all the responses currently at work and im on my break but ill read all the replies when i get home later edit double gold wow thanks so much by the way its totally normal for older people to have kiddie meals its just annoying when some of them make a big deal out of it or are obviously trying to grab attention by doing so im not judging anyone by their fast food choices people asking for updates there are none but i will remember to post it here if he does text me edit last night he finally texted i dont feel comfortable sharing anything more because its getting really personal and i am investing quite a bit of my feelings into this too but just wanted to let you guys know that hes probably going to be ok thanks again for the unbelievable support this will be my final update 
hi so this actually happened many years ago i was reading some of the stories on this sub and was reminded about the nice employee who basically payed for of my purchase for free i was young maybe years old im not even sure how long ago this was i had saved every little penny i got until i had roughly when i went into the store i had a mission i knew i was going to buy a ds lite i was saving up for it for soo long my mom didnt really support buying anything related to games so i left my mom somewhere in the store and went over to the electronics section i walked up nervously to the store clerk and asked for a ds lite thinking back on it i have to applaud him for treating me like any other customer instead of looking down on me because i was young he politely went over to the case with the game systems and brought a ds lite over he rang it up like normal and then waited patiently while i took out all of the crumbled wads of cash to pay for it after counting all of my money i found that with the added tax the price of the ds was more than i had i probably had the most disappointed look on my face because he took the money and took out his own wallet and payed for the remaining and some odd cents i cant forget the joy i felt when he did that for me if you read this store clerk thank you for then 
a little over a decade ago i worked in the limousine business driving clients on the weekends i have many stories that range from strange to horrible and others being outrageously awesome this is one of my more humorous facepalm ones i pick up richceo from his house in an upscale part of the city ive already driven this guy earlier in the year and he likes to impress the ladies hes a bit of a sexist pig imho and i know what to expect from him and how he talks about women in general my instructions are to pick him up pick up his lady friend at her place drive to a gala and then open until his hours are up this unscheduled part of the evening is unusual but not uncommon for a regular client whos used us before lady friend lf is rather attractive and dressed to the nines in her slinky thighhigh dress and done up hair nothing out of the ordinary happens as i drop them off wait around the corner and grab a bite to eat i pick them up at hour or so and richceo wants me to drive around town for a bit before heading home he rolls the partition up and im good with not having to make further contact i know the best streets to cruise around so im driving around with no destination in mind some time has past and im not thinking about anything in particular when i feel the limo start to bounce what people do in limos is not my business but its still funny when stuff like this starts everyone in the back always thinks they are going about this act unnoticed teehee we wont be caught sorry drivers know every single time it happens when your car is bouncing slightly its a red flag that the people in the back are bumping uglies we are just discreet enough not to let on we know first rule of the limo club dont talk about the sex they just had limos have extra dark tint on the windows that have a one way mirror effect from the outside the clients can see out but you cant see in richceo and lf are going at it softly at first but seeing as how they are getting into it being discreet isnt their focus im traveling surface streets so stoplights are frequent every few minutes while im moving nothing appears out of the ordinary come to a completely stop however it quite obvious something is happening in the im in the far right lane and i notice a cop car pulls up to me on the left i normally dont give them much notice but i glanced over and found them both neck turned in my direction i fully look over and they have this whhhaaaat the hell expressions across their faces i am just smiling and shaking my head with that hey its none of my business look the light turns and we go another block or so and the cops are keeping pace what richceo and lf are doing is not something the cops can legally pull me over for but i can tell they are up to something i pull up to another stop light and the building off to the right that im in front of has mirrored glass windows the cops are on my left but have pulled back a bit so their doors and are next to the middle of the limo im at a loss as to what they are doing but what happens next has me doubled over with controlled laughter they douse the spotlight at the dark tinted windows of the limo and it shines through the vehicle hitting the mirrored building behind it and bouncing back both sides now have light and this is basically illuminates the entire inside of the limo the tint becomes completely ineffective as if looking through normal glass the cops can see everything perfectly as richceo and lf are frozen midthrust i look over at the mirrored reflection of the building and see the colored silhouette and topless form of lf scrambling to find cover and i hear ohh coming from the back the cops use the loudspeaker please put your clothes back on and i can tell the both officers are laughing their asses off as i look in the driverside mirror im fighting back stifled laughter as the two back are frantic to find their clothes the cop car slowly forward and i smilesalute them as they pass and yes before you can think of a pun for this story the dude was copblocked tldr driving clients who decide to have sex in the back cops notice the bouncing limo and shine a spotlight on them forcing them to stop and hide midthrust edit clarification and speeling 
i mentioned i once had nearly an entire person staff quit and as promised here is the story names and a few details changed for everyones protection for setup i had been hired on as an acting store manager basically for an entire six state region id fill in whenever a manager was out of the store for longer than hours vacation sickness maternity etc we were basically substitute teachers of the retail world this was only temporary and when a store manager position opened up i could step in with zero probation period there were three of us in this role i was the first hire of a rather ambitious new district manager callie i interviewed her third or fourth day in the job and she was psyched about everything in the company and talked at length about her plans of course all this ambition meant she bit off more than she could chew and within six weeks she was burning out callie had originally planned to visit every store in her district over her first three months but according to rumor the previous dm knowing he was retiring had sort of slacked off so all the stores had issues one way or another she ended up spending far more time at each location than she wanted which is why she hadnt made it to this one store ill call it store at all so callie sends an email that shes heading down to check up on them just before she leaves a semi surprise visit we get an email not long after saying that she needs an acting store manager there asap asking for one of the two of us who were free victoria and i not five minutes later theres a revision she needs both victoria and i so knowing were heading in to disaster we each drive four hours to the store walking in the place is a mess not just normal retail mess but actual dirty windows literal dirt caked in the corners of the floor burnt out bulbs etc callie is just sitting at the managers desk looking like someone hit her with a brick she tells us that she walked in and the previous store manager jane handed her her resignation and walked out the only full time employee was gone too and there was a lot wrong with the store so victoria and i take over registers finish out the day and then the part timer hands in her name tag and says she quits this was sadly just the start of it that night we literally spent the entire night at the store i cant tell you what order we found out the mess there but over the next few days it all unfolded the old system in place wasnt really integrated between cash registers and accounting and there was a step in there where managers would transcribe numbers it seemed that jane had been faking the numbers for cash oh and the last four deposits disappeared never taken to the bank and nowhere in the safe plus there were these mysterious bins in the front with heavily discounted manager sale items marked as cash sale only we puzzled over this for a while before finding that occasionally jane would mark shipments as coming in damaged and unsaleable items which mysteriously were the same as those in the bins so cash fraud great then the next morning none of the morning staff showed up victoria and i are running the store solo for a while while callie sat in the managers office shifting through paperwork trying to figure out all that was wrong with the store an employee shows up but just to hand in their badge and tell us to stick it up our asses one of the weird things we had noticed was that there were far more people staffed for this store than made sense jane had one full time employee then a ton of part timers mostly each only working hours a week this didnt seem the weirdest thing about the store but we later suspected she wouldnt have anyone there long enough to figure out things were shady almost all of those employees were high school kids or people who were there to earn spending cash rather than a living none of them were really invested in the job when we finally had an employee show up she tells us the full time employee had called her and fed her this line about how jane who apparently was very well liked by the staff had been cruelly fired corporate was screwing them over and how they need to make a stand if all of them quit the store would go under and theyd benefitsomehow apparently a really good number of them decided the statement was worth more than the job and had decided to quit callie ends up telling me to call the entire staff one by one and asking if they planned to continue employment i spent an hour with everything from slammed phones to cursing to lame excuses most talked about how they hated our corporate who was mean and a few mentioned how corporate wouldnt even give them their bonuses what now end of yearchristmas time all employees who had worked more than six months would get a visa gift card value dependant on number of hours worked i hadnt heard of any problems neither had callie who forwarded it on to accounting meanwhile knowing that we had basically no one to work the store we sent out an email to the closest stores if they could spare a few employees we would pay for their transportation meals while working if travel was more than an hour wed pay for a hotel room and they would have a hour week at double normal pay this was during summer when there were a lot of college kids so people jumped at it by close we had locked in about people from or different stores to work staring the next day and staying for at least weeks this in addition to the or part timers who hadnt quit on us meanwhile all day its calls from corporate from the corporate lawyers etc to callie who looks like shes ready to cry we get word corporate is sending two representatives into town again my timeline isnt entirely straight here but in the next days callie finds out that all the bonuses were given out sent to the store signature required all appeared to be redeemed then later i heard all were redeemed at the same walmat oh yeah jane had stolen from her adoring employees we later heard from the next door sub place that just before callie showed up jane and the full time employee had been loading boxes in their car our of the store wait thier car oh yes the two were dating and who knows what they had just stolen we also found over the next days that inventory was just a nonexistant thing according to the system we had more negative quantities than positives and none of our stock was made from anti matter we task a few employees to re inventory the store headed by victoria while i handle store operations and hiring a new staff she finds out that theres just boxes of stuff everywhere tucked in nonsensical places still in packing boxes mixed in illogically inventory was this nearly impossible thing as they kept finding stuff a box in the bathroom shipping boxes stacked in the backroom used as a table a box stuck up in the damn ceiling tiles found by the electrician im trying to retrain the old part timers meanwhile some realized they needed to basically erase how the store was run and start over others insisted that this is how its always been done like layaway our company didnt do layaway we never did layaway apparently jane did layaway but thats wrong and i have no way of verifying what those customers spent lots of confusion and issues forwarded to corporate one or two employees just had to be let go because they insisted doing things janes way the backroom had been a mess and i was sparing man hours just to clean cleaning up back there they found a door that had been covered with empty boxes it was locked and victoria and i were debating whether it was ours or lead to the adjoining store somehow then one of the part timers chimed in something along the lines that thats the trash room they locked it up when it got full now that employee was high school aged and i think this was her first job and she said it like this was a sane and logical comment as though every business had a full trash room so not really wanting to know the answer i asked what a trash room consisted of apparently if it was raining or they didnt want to go out to the dumpster theyd just throw their trash in there callie had just sat down with the corporate guy when i walked up to the office and informed them of this they both just stared at me like i shit in their cheerios a locksmith was called in to open the door and we found a ft x ft room chest high full of boxes and trash bags and stuff the only saving grace was it was closed up long enough to be not fresh garbage smell but old musty garbage at any given point over the next few days we would have an employee wearing gloves and digging through it a bag of receipts kept for evidence a bag of trash from the bathroom a box of unopened merchandise covered in fluids leaked from a questionable bag that may have contained food at some point inexplicably a busted up bicycle the employees would come up shell shocked on break describing the weird horrors they found all this time im hiring a whole new staff normally we did background checks and a lengthy interview this was shortened to my fifteen minute judgement calls on someone and can you start training tomorrow as far as the thefts etc i cant tell you the end conclusion callie and the corporate guy kept that bottled up but there were lots of calls to the lawyer but the end result was that store needed a new manager someone who could finish training the random new hires handle the pissed off customers who suddenly saw their store turned upside down handle inventory and of course the angry ex employees thankfully they picked victoria and i went to my next less stressful assignment
sort of so today was insane i had an hour shift and spent about minutes not on the register of those minutes being my break it was crazy having last minute shoppers always breeds rude ass people i had this young guy in my line he comes up i say hello he ignores me i ask how he is he ignores me i ask if he has a store card he gives me a short and rude no okay then hes paying in cash and takes out his money to pay hes counting out the last of his bills and i politely hold my hand out to take it he pauses looks at my hand and throws the money onto the counter at me yeah probably one of the things i hate most that customers do its just so effing rude especially when im holding my hand out and you look right at it and still act like a jackass okay then buddy call me a jerk for this move but i have no regrets this guy is getting cents back in change i print out his receipt slap it down on the counter and he holds his hand out for the change so naturally i drop his change onto his receipt smile and say have a nice day his face flushes with embarrassment and he mumbles a thank you he spends about half a minute red faced and picking up his change he wont look at me i felt a little bad afterwards but like come on you saw my hand you decided to be rude anyway so enjoy me being rude back while still smiling at you maybe next time hell be nicer to the cashier merry christmas
this happened yesterday during a quite busy shift where i was solo on the csd i had two customers in my line one ill call refunds nightmare lady or rnl and the other ill call mr nice guy mng to cut a long story short the rn wanted four refunds doing why she hadnt done them before i dont know and i knew i was in for some fun now our returns policy means that if you pay by card any refund will be put on the same card this is printed on the receipts and is also displayed in store the first two refunds no problem they went through straight away but even though i was working as fast as i could rnl was massively impatient she kept making comments like i cant believe this takes so long ive got to pick kids up from school soon and other similarly annoying remarks i gritted my teeth and kept quiet apologising to mng in the process then came the last refund this is where it went wrong the rnl didnt have the card for one of the refunds so id had to give her store credit vouchers for that i suggested to her that as she was doing this refund and buying items which would add up to just over the balance of her store credit voucher she could use this towards the balance and then pay a tiny difference of something like she seemed happy to do this and so i did my bit with the refund put the new items though and then tried to scan the voucher through to adjust the balance it didnt work and regardless of what i did to see if it would work typing in the voucher number manually different scanner angles even lying the voucher completely flat on the counter top and then scanning it to see if it was due to the paper curving nothing worked and the rnl began kicking off saying i was terrible at customer service how this shop was terrible and all the usual stuff eventually she decided to use a credit card paid and left i was just glad she was gone i then started serving mng whose query thank ltdeity of choicegt was really easy i apologised profusely for the wait and he was seemingly perfectly cheery about the whole thing waving my apology away then he asked gti want to speak to your manager at this point i was panicking as i couldnt think why hed want to do this i was really hoping it wasnt something id done i phoned the manager who was at the back of the store helping out with a delivery and she told me to send him down her way and shed speak to him min later and i got a call to my internal phone asking if i could come down to the desk i got cover for the desk and went down panicking about whether it was some sort of disciplinary usually the manager doesnt call you like this unless its something wrong when i went down the man and my supervisor were sat at the desk when the man saw me he got up pointed to me and said to my manager look youve got a damn good cashier here shes got the patience of a saint i know i wouldnt have been able to do what she did with that woman turns out the man had been singing my praises about how i dealt with rnl saying how professional and calm id been it made for a euphoric rest of my shift for both me and my manager 
long time reader first time poster blah blah blah its long so feel free to ignore i have always lived in the city but moved to a very small rural town last year lots of farms ranches and woods im actually growing to love it except for the community of rich entitled people who come down on the weekends thankfully i do not work in customer service in any form so my contact with them is minimal ive had two very memorable encounters at the same grocery store both with the same amazing witness first one i was shopping on a friday afternoon a few months ago stocking up regular stuff as well as a planned party for my sos coworkers so the total came to about i had been helping bag everything as it was being rung up the clerk finished gave me the total but before i could move the woman in line behind me stomped forward swiped her card and punched in her pin then went back to yacking on her phone i just stood there for a moment looking at her i finally said excuse me she cut this glare at me and turned away so again excuse me and i get i am on the phone god some people are so rude you want rude bitch i was just wondering why you paid for my groceries not that i dont really appreciate it her what im not paying for your shit how dare you what makes you think anyone would just pay for you me well you just did maam you swiped your card and paid for my groceries her it doesnt matter when i swipe the card during the transaction me it does if shes still ringing up my transaction and now weve got a problem transaction is complete and yes she has paid for my groceries she actually got off the phone at that point we get a manager over to try to figure out what to do they end up deciding for the manager to do a complete return of the groceries to her card and then ring them up again so i can pay and cue the bitching shes in a hurry her time is valuable this is ridiculous so i toss in lady at this point i could walk out the door my groceries are paid for and this is a problem that you caused now the clerk had gone to another register and started ringing other customers but there was a guy standing behind bitchy woman hes a solid or more just a huge guy obvious biker black leather tshirt chains you name it when i said that he cracked up laughing and said wow youre a cute thing but you are a little badass arent you the bitchy woman turned to him and said something about minding his own business thats it lady poke the grizzly bear what could happen and this guys face went from laughing to scary in a second flat he told her lady you need to just stand there quietly while they clean up the mess you made i dont intimidate easily but even i was nervous but then he smiled and winked at me so the manager does the return and i chat with scary biker guy he told me that he keeps telling his little girl that its important to be polite but its also important to stand up for yourself every time the bitch woman made a noise like huffed or explosive sigh he made this little sound almost like a growl the clerk offered to check him out a few times but he just stood there arms crossed a solid mountain of a man talking to me finally the return is done and the bitch has the nerve to ask so can i get checked out now you are going to let me go first right i just said no and the manager started reringing my stuff final dig bitch started the i am never shopping here again do you know how much business you are going to lose i glanced over her items and said what thirty thirty five dollars oh my god they will have to lay off half their staff biker guy called me little badass again and went to the next lane to pay for his stuff ive run into this guy a few times even met his wife and little girl once whos not much younger than i am he calls me little badass every time then came today i just needed a few things so i run in on my way home i got to the store and there are signs everywhere and i mean everywhere both doors all across the front windows posted on several aisles and on every register cash only computers not working all purchases must be paid in cash im good so i grab what i need and get in line there were only two open in front of me is an older woman with a cart full of stuff everything is rung up and she whips out her checkbook clerk uh maam youll need to pay cash our computers arent working there are signs woman i saw those signs you can take a check its the same thing and tried to hand the check to the clerk clerk maam i cant take that we can only take cash woman waved the check in the clerks face just take it its the same as cash and me maam the only thing thats the same as cash is cash woman you stay out of this you filthy little bitch me what the hell and enter biker guy and wife hey little badass i thought i heard your voice how are you we chatted for a second and the woman is still shoving her check in the poor clerks face me lady seriously you need to pay with cash they cannot take a check a check is not the same as cash woman turned look you caught sight of biker guy and slammed her mouth shut glared for a second then says so what would you suggest i do me well there is a bank across the street another about a half mile that way another about that far that way i would suggest you go get cash she grumbled and slammed things around then pulled out a wad of cash with more than enough to pay for her shit gave me one more glare and stomped out biker guy still the little badass i see though i wish id called you little ass kicker bikers wife she wont get that reference me sure i do its what daryl called the baby when she was born biker guy just roared and yanked open his jacket to show me his walking dead t shirt we ended up in the parking lot for a half hour talking about last nights episode and what we thought was coming next i should mention with the first incident i did think after i left the store that i could have gone to the atm and pulled the cash to pay the bitch but im actually glad i didnt think of that so that i got to waste all her valuable time if you actually read all this thanks hope you got a laugh and hope that the next bitch customer comes with a little badass and big ass biker dude tldr bikers are amazing defenders of little badasses who stand up to bitchy customers edit fixed the typo they bug me thanks for catching it edit sorry for the walking dead spoiler if anyone knows how to hide it please let me know i didnt realize there were places that were so far behind us and for those who went there i have a boyfriend that i moved to the middle of nowhere with and big

so a few years back i was running a gas station inside a us national park gas station prices are always high and tourism prices are even higher snacks were pretty average but if you needed a phone charger or jumper cables it was gonna be pretty pricey but thats what you get for coming unprepared so one day i have two guys pull up in their pickup middleaged white executive types who seem used to people bending over backwards for them they need gas and they need a gas can so they can take a fillup back to their generator down at creek of course the people who bring a generator to a remote campsite are my least favorite kind but what can you do i grab the can and they scoff when i ring it up and its around so they walk away and its no skin off my nose im happy to know their generator wont be running all night about minutes later they come back in and purchase a jug of windshield washer fluid and then they start to pester my other customers asking if they can fill up their windshield washer reservoirs im getting suspicious gtme seriously youre going to do that right in front of me you have to know thats illegal gtc well we need something to put the gas in gtme yeah i can sell you a legal gas can but using that container is illegal its so thin the gas might eat through it on your way back its not safe for you or the park gtc its my container now i can use it however i need to gtme you can do whatever youd like with your jug good luck convincing me to sell you any gasoline gtc fine well just take it somewhere else gtme of course sir next gas station is miles south over mt this was our favorite gag all the stations are run by the same company and all the employees were pretty close so whenever one of us had a difficult customer who insisted on driving to the next station heshe would just call that station and give them a heads up then whoever was working the next station would repeat the exact same conversation using the exact same words if possible and offer that they were welcome to check out the next station at wherever it was they just came from but this guy wasnt having it gtc look were just going to pour this out and then well just put a little gas in it its no big deal that is crazy illegal we are in a national park why did you come if you just want to run a generator and pour chemicals into the soil but its also just so funny because i know these guys have zero power in this situation gtme in my most bored tone possible sir if you pour out chemicals onto federally protected land i will have to call the law enforcement rangers their office is that building next door i know what youre driving i know where your staying and i know that there is exactly one road that you could possibly be driving on for the next minutes you will be arrested or heavily fined or both youll also be removed from the property and will now have a federal record gtc fine well just return the fluid gtme im sorry but we have a no return policy enjoy your stay
this happened when i was visiting my hometown a while back i went to my old store and saw a bunch of boots scattered all over the floor being the nice person that i am i decided to pick up after the rude customers one of whom i recognized i was listening to an audiobook while doing this mid way through my clean up the lady who i recognize comes up to me and taps me on my shoulder i take off my headphones and she demands to speak to my manager apparently she was trying to get my attention but i could not hear her over my audiobook i was acting extremely unprofessionally by having my phone out i explained i was actually cleaning up after customers like her who do not know how to clean up their own mess oh and i dont work here anymore
read a story earlier that reminded me about years ago i was working stacking shelves at a supermarket we had large cages with stock on them that we use to break down the stock and stack the shelves so i was in my aisle stacking away when a man and his family wife and young girls enterred the aisle behind me the man proceed to say get the f out of my way stupid girl i being a good drone smiled brainlessly moved my cage and said sorry sir when suddenly my guardian angel in the form of another customer came out from behind the rude man and said excuse me you apologise to this young lady right now have you no shame and in front of your kids too the man looked shocked and ashamed then apologised to me before scurrying off with his family i thanked her she told me i was allowed to stand up for myself then went on her way hooray for customers that will stand up against rude people

during my college years i managed an electronics store we rarely had people nick our goods but this pair made up for it one fine saturday afternoon a couple of guys walked into the store and instantly read shady not just to me and the store owner mind you but to the civilians as well one shopper came up to me out of kindness to let me know and i nodded the show began one guy tried to distract me and the owner with questions about the latest computer on one side of the store while the other rather unstealthily started stacking stereo equipment near the front door pro tip skulking and eyedarting is best left done to the pros everyone is watching the pair is oblivious to their obviousness if i could have made popcorn for the audience wed have covered rent for the day finally the owner nodded me to the front as the other guy was in the back preparing his next load i had the pleasure of noticing the random pile of gear near the front saying in a loud voice gt whatever are all these boxes doing here i had better restock them and began moving them back they left rather abruptly to laughter and applause
i work in a cafe that brews a certain brand of coffee although we carry that brand of coffee we arent that company we buy it off them in large amounts follow a certain procedure sell it for their listing price and make a profit a little complicated but not rocket science every single day half of our customers try to use the coffees gift cards i explain im sorry we only accept gift cards for our cafe not the brand of coffee we brew usually the customer will notice the sign we have hanging on the register and say thats right i forgot or oh thats strange but okay or oh im sorry just cancel our order then yesterday i had a customer go insane over this policy customer whats the difference you get your money anyway me no im sorry that gift card was purchased from that coffee company we are not that company customer well look at the signs everywhere look at your cups me we do brew this coffee but we are not owned by them we purchase their product for sale customer exactly you have a contract if youre working with the coffee company and sell their product you must take this gift card me no maam thats not how gift cards work if you have a gift card for a restaurant and that restaurant happens to sell frozen food in the super market you cant use the restaurant gift card in the super market customer look i want to use this gift card me we dont accept them but you can try and swipe it if youd like she stood there and swiped four or five times each time i would respond the computer says tender not approved customer well what does that mean me it means we dont accept those gift cards 
edit wow this story got to the top of tfr thanks guys another story from the shop of fabric curtains and blinds we have many regular customers some lovely some tedious and a couple that are just horrible it was one of those days where everything goes wrong and id had enough when in walks this customer now little background last time she came in a few weeks ago there was some altercation between her and a coworker something about the price i think the customer spat the dummy and vowed to never return to the store again which was met with collective relief so this grouchy old bitch b comes in and makes a beeline for me right off the bat shes being a snobby cow gtme good morning anything i can help you with gtb are the new fabrics in yet last time she was in i had mentioned that i believed the new fabrics would be coming in a couple of weeks gtme no not yet sorry gtb but last time you said they would be in in a couple of weeks its been a couple of weeks gtme well i believed they would be in but they havent come in our delivery yet gtb but you said theyd be in you said that gtme yes i know but i wasnt sure its usually in by now but i guess its running a little late at this point shes following me around the store raising her voice and jabbing me in the arm with her long pointy fingernails every time she says you said i have had a bad day and everyone in the store want to see the back of this woman so gtb last time i was in here you said gtme you know what last time you were in here you said youd never return to this store again so why dont you make good on that threat and piss off theres the door go use it stunned silence what a glorious moment havent seen her since and i got a pat on the back from the boss for ridding us of such a nuisance tldr if you threaten to never come back dont be surprised if the reaction is a sigh of relief and a thank you edit since its apparently of great interest to a lot of you im australian d spitting the dummy pacifier means throwing a tantrum and im happy to be a hero as long as i get a cool name and an awesome mask to protect my identity p
so i worked at a gas station once upon a time and i was on break sitting behind the counter while my coworker was on the till it was a semibusy day and since we were working in british columbia we were just adjusting to the new law where people had to prepay for their gas before pumping it sadly different gas stations had different methods for this so it could get a little confusing for customers this guy came in walked in front of the line and put his credit card on the counter expecting us to turn on the pump for him while we kept his credit card as collateral then started to leave to go pump gas my coworker called out for him to stop and come back for a second then she explained that we actually needed to run his credit card through our machine before we could turn on the gas pump because thats just how our computer system was programmed she told him he would have to wait in line and prepay like the other customers were doing this guy decides to take it personally and says just turn on the damn pump and tosses his credit card at my coworker i get up off my stool walk over to his credit card on the ground stand up and fire it at him like a throwstar and loudly and firmly say get out manager laughs coworker hugs me man storms out back to business as usual moral of the story dont mess with my coworkers

working as an assistant manager in a clothing store i have come across a lot of different people from the mother teresas to the adolf hitlers of the world and then there was this lady who didnt just fly over the cuckoos nest but hit the goddamn tree im sitting in the back office of the shop on a rainy september day doing the weekly administration when the phone rings me good afternoon shop name this is my name speaking how may i help you lady hello yes this is mrs cuckoo speaking i cringe inwardly because i know this lady the type that comes in wants to try on everything leaving the place looking like a fucking tornado just tossed a farm at it with nothing more than some item that was on sale me hello mrs cuckoo what can i do for you lady well i bought this tshirt from your shop a while back but it has holes in it me oh dear i do apologize maam if you could come by the shop with the item and the receipt i am more than happy to give you a refund lady i dont want a refund i want a new shirt me that is no problem at all maam if you could just tell me the product number it should be on the receipt that way i can check if we still have one in stock or whether i have to order one for you lady i dont have the receipt anymore i threw it away now i have to mention that we have a day return policy we normally dont take back items without a receipt but fuck it i was feeling generous and havent we all thrown out receipts we thought wed never need at some point me well we normally dont take items back without a receipt maam but for you i will make an exception the product name should also be on the little label on the inside of the shirt could you read that out for me lady i cut out the label me oh dear lady well it was all itchy after i washed it me after you washed it lady well yes i washed it took it with me on holiday so of course i had to wash it when i got home me maam when exactly did you buy this shirt from us lady somewhere in march i think why is that important it has holes in it me maam that was six months ago lady so me so you want me to replace a tshirt you bought at our shop six months ago dont have any receipt for cut the label out of put through the laundry and went on holiday with lady well yes annoyed sigh me maam i cant do that i am willing to make an exception if someone accidentally threw out the receipt or if someone brings back an item a couple of days outside our day return policy i am not that difficult really but you cant expect me to take back an item that you have owned and worn for the last six months lady well why the hell not because after this long a time i dont know whether you havent been white water rafting with it or maybe you have a weird fetish for being covered in hungry rats or perhaps you went on an expedition to the north pole and encountered some polar bears what the hell do i know its not like our clothes are made of kevlar me because it is well outside of our day return limit and because its been worn and washed maam im sorry lady well this is just ridiculous i am a paying customer at your store i was very happy with this shirt especially since it was halfpriced and now its already ruined me well maam it also states on all our receipts that all reduced items are nonreturnable lady how am i supposed to know that i threw out the receipt me i understand maam maybe next time you could keep it in a safe place it is really quite handy to save your receipts to prevent unfortunate things like this from happening in the future lady dont tell me what to do me im sorry maami was merely suggesting lady are you suggesting that im stupid or something yes yes i am me not at all maam i have accidentally thrown out receipts in the past too i understand this is something most people lady i am not most people i am unique there is only one like me in this world thank fuck for that lady i will be calling your head office and file an official complaint me you do that maam would you like for me to give you their telephone number lady fuck you hangs up after that i sent a quick email to head office telling them about this woman just in case she did decide to call it somehow got forwarded to the big boss in denmark who promptly changed his email signature to name company ceo phone number email unique snowflake i never saw her in the shop again tldr lady tries to return item she has owned for six months then goes on to tell me she is most definitely not most people 
i used to be a cashier and whenever a customer used a card we had to ask for id it was company policy and we got into huge trouble if we got caught neglecting it i was working at the register next to my coworker sarah and we had a huge line to be clear we sold tickets this customer asks for about in tickets this almost never happens the lady whips out her card and hands it to sarah who asks to see some id the look on this womans face you would have thought we slapped her ive never been asked for an id before she shrieked i doubt that maam its always been company policy sarah responded with a huff the customer shoved her id toward sarah but the name on her id didnt match the name on the card sarah said so the lady snatched her id back pulled out a second one and flicked it back at her that one didnt match either this lady had four separate ids with four different names and the same photograph of her by the way none of which matched the name on the card the lady demanded to see a manager and im not sure what he said though she did storm off in a huff i imagine he told her that it was company policy and if she couldnt provide an id for the card she could take her business elsewhere im still wondering why we didnt call the cops edit to answer some questions the manager on duty was years old and the laziest dude i have ever worked with im surprised he even spoke to her at all i did not know he was the manager on duty at the time the box office was very secluded and unless we needed to do a refund the managers left us to our own devices i was not the cashier who turned the matter over to the manager sarah was i assumed she told him to call the police at the time i did not find out that the manager neglected to do so until the next day as i said she left in a huff so the best he could have done would have been to send the cops after her i didnt even fully see this womans face i only overheard the conversation apparently it is illegal to ask for id for certain creditdebit cards this is news to me if the company knew this however they didnt care they were pretty neglectful of most things including certain labor and equality laws wow thank you guys for all the feedback here that is super cool 
this was back in my teenage years working at a froyo place so this guy order a large froyo with toppings i make the order for him and hand it over to my coworker in the toppings section he was a nice guy left a little tip in my tip jar so i decided to be nice and i say to my coworker in korean give this guy lots of strawberries the guy hears this and says dont skim on my order i know chinese i know you guys are always speaking chinese to rip customers off thinking we dont know what youre saying lol what this guy also had chinese letters as tattoos all over his neck and arms didnt give the guy extra strawberries 
i work at a coffee place and some locations are also an ice cream place i used to work for one that also sold ice cream but it was entirely miserable so i transferred to exclusively coffee anyway our night shifts were hideously understaffed for how busy we were especially during summer we made our waffle cones instore and to make a full batch thats basically one employee sat in front of the waffle cone maker doing exclusively that for one to two hours helping customers if the store got busy while the only other employee scheduled was doingwell everything else in the store so oftentimes we didnt have time to make them but we had two other types of cones people still had a tendency to get really disproportionately angry about it cause yknow customers anyway so this guy comes in orders an ice cream in a waffle cone my coworker and i apologize and tell him that unfortunately were sold out and offer one of our other cones dude stares blankly gtdude you seriously dont have waffle cones at an ice cream place i want a waffle cone what are you gonna do about it my coworker and i exchange ohgodherewefuckinggo looks and dont say anything for a moment when the guy starts laughing gtdude nah im kidding ill take a sugar cone no big deal people dont actually get pissed about that do they gtme actually yeah weve had people literally scream at us about it before indeed the only customer whos ever made me cry in my three and a half years working retail was screaming at me about waffle cones gtdude incredulous look youre kidding what the hell kind of sad life do you have when you have to throw a tantrum over ice cream i wanted to hug him
for the context i work at a large clothing retail chain im usually there most evenings and weekends and i interact with every customer who crosses my path because its in my job description to do so in reality like most of you i fucking hate the condescending treatment and constant complaints i get from customers on the regular and my mood improves x the minute i leave as i try to forget everything about it oddly enough i have three sweet sweet days in a row off this week like a long weekend from mondaywednesday i feel almost human again yesterday i was at the grocery store doing my weekly shopping after class a middleaged soccermom type of lady approaches me and asks do you work at store not entirely sure how to respond i say yeeeesss with some confusion and trepidation in my voice gt soccer mom great i dont have time to go in today unless its worth my while whats the big sale today gt me um i dont know im not working today gt soccer mom they dont announce the big sales to you before gt me no and even if they did it wouldnt matter because im not working today you can call the store and ask or check your email i start sloooowly edging away toward the end of the produce section in the vain hopes of escaping this dedicated bargain hunter gt soccer mom well youve been no help to me good luck finding me coming back to your store youve just lost a regular customer and stalks off i added a bottle of wine to my grocery list after this exchange moral of the story if you work retail enough to be recognizable always leave the house in a disguise obligatory edit thanks its my first time getting gilded

quick backstory ive been working at a grocery store for nearly years now started when i was the first four months or so i was a bagger then the managers had me crosstrained as a cashier this story occurred about a week after that training guy walks into my line and in his rather large order is a large pack of chicken legs its one of the last items i ring up and as soon as i scan it he goes off saying that the associate in the market had told him it would be a different cheaper price hes pissed so i apologize and call my manager but he evidently wants to go bitch at the associate who told him the price so he grabs the pack and starts storming off towards the back with his order still sitting in front of me with a line of about ten people behind him im not sure what to do but before i can do anything the nothing lady who was behind him in line turns and at the top of her voice yells hey get the hell back here and pay for your shit chicken guy stops dead in his tracks then turns around and comes back he starts in on this lady but he also starts paying for his order as i recall he wrote a check hes going on dont you ever fucking talk to me like that again you dont know who i am and shes giving it right back i dont give a fuck who you are you dont walk off like that you see this line it continues like that them at each others throats and poor me just trying to finish the order and stay unnoticed finally his order finishes and he snatches his shit up and say ill be waiting for you outside bitch she looks him dead in the eye and says in a supremely unconcerned voice you go right ahead i carry a gun in my handbag motherfucker and then turns to me and as if nothings happened smiles and says hi there could i have a pack of marlboros please chicken guy slunk off quietly and judging by the lack of gunshots after the lady walked out quietly went home
this is a tale from the bakery in a grocery store an old woman comes in to complain saying that we spelled her grandsons name wrong on the cake and everyone was so upset but they still ate the cake anyway and she demands a free cake that would be believable but when we take orders we make sure to ask for name spellings and when the customer picks up the cake we show it to them first before they actually buy it old woman says she wasnt the one who picked up the cake gets more upset at us reiterating that the name was spelled wrong and so on and so forth basically not wanting to listen to any reason so we give up the bakery manager comes out and says okay maam were sorry that your grandsons day was ruined we can make it up to him with another cake with his name on it then the old woman hits us with this line i want the cake for next weekend and write happy birthday mom on it and then she leaves i firmly believe that this was a setup for them to get out of buying another cake for another event 
so there have been a few stories on here recently about rude annoying and just plain mean customers getting what they deserve im gonna join in this story happened a few years ago i wasnt the employee but rather just a spectator a friend and myself went to a local fast food restaurant and went to the drivethru and got some ice cream we decided that wed park the car in the lot and eat since we didnt want it to melt nor did we feel like going inside anyway we got out and sat on the trunk of my car where we had a direct view of the drivethru suddenly this one gentleman with a woman as his passenger pulls up to the windows in a very nice looking convertible and starts making really derogatory comments to the employees in the windows like really derogatory whats it feel like to have a shitty job do you smell like french fries all the time my salary pays for you illegals to come here and work i should get this food for free yes thats a ten dollar bill have you ever seen one even if he was joking it was really inappropriate and we felt bad for all the workers so anyway he gets his food and pulls into a spot close to me where he begins to inspect the bags contents i guess looking for one more thing to berate them about suddenly the car that was behind him pulls out of the drivethru and parks next to him the guy in the other car shouts hey the jerk looks over we look over and the gentlemen proceeds to throw his large vanilla ice cream with oreos and mampms right into the convertible its everywhere on the man his girl the seats the dashboard everywhere the man is dumbfounded speechless he looks over at the other man with an angry look and is about to say something when the other man says learn how to be a decent human being you fing ahole how dare you make fun of people for no reason who do you think you are the other man drives off the jerk drives off still covered in ice cream me and my friend are now speechless as well we finish our ice cream and go smiling all the way home
this is actually a positive story for once im a manager in a store that sells on top of what we normally sell baby clothes and various other gear and supplies for infants i am not a manager for this part of the store i know virtually nothing about babies at all other than where merchandise is im a year old man and an only child my life consists of beer college classes and video games that said a woman comes into our store while most of our associates over that part of the store were on break she also only speaks spanish no one in our store speaks spanish as the acting manager this very quickly becomes my problem to deal with and i was expecting the worst i did not get the worst this woman had the patience of a saint and a personality to match she could not have been friendlier to me despite not understanding a word i said to her and vice versa she was pregnant and had absolutely no idea what to buy for her incoming child and i had no idea what to recommend her but we had common ground in one area smartphones i was able to explain to her very slowly how to translate what she was saying on google to english so she would very slowly communicate through text in very broken electronically translated english her questions and i would in turn do the same to spanish this took a very long time but she was completely cooperative and borderline amused at how the situation was occurring in the end she placed an order for over in furniture and i walked her through the store while she created a registry of close to items for her friends and family all through google translate this might seem like a fairly insignificant story but being able to communicate with someone in a completely different world and truly help them out really made my day i feel like i did something important tonight 
i worked in a southern department store for years of which i was head lingerie fitter and these are my stories i first started telling them here and got told you guys would love if i shared so here i am d i hope that link worked i suck at formatting im sorry in advance if it didnt i have copied my stories from the ask reddit thread to start off with so you guys dont have to go back and search smelly snatch amp mannequin molester the most shocking to me was when this older couple came in reeking of black and milds and booze more so the wife than the husband the wife who had scraggly blonde hair missing teeth loose skin dripping everywhere from a recent weight loss and all around bad personal hygiene asked me to fit her for a bra cause it had been upwards for years since she had bought a bra always willing to help i happily agreed we go into the fitting room and before i know it she strips her top half and lifts her arms to reveal long and i mean loooooong tangled underarm hair so i measure her tell her size and she seems delighted so i leave her in the room and i go select a couple bras for her once i leave the room i see her husband caressing the mannequins vagina and staring at its arse i let it go and go on the hunt for bras while im looking he then starts yelling quite loudly i may add at how much would i be willing to sell the pretty young blonde for i politely told him they werent for sale etc etc but he still kept asking caressing and even sniffing the life sized mannequin so i smiled nodded and went back in to cater to his wife when i got in there she asked since i had measured her bust would i kindly measure her waist and hips cause shed like to know once again i agreed with a smile i was at her waist told her the number and she got so excited ya know cause of the weight loss i squatted down do reach her hips and booooom she pulls down her elastic banded mum jeans to reveal her large flurry matted muff about inches in front of my face was this womans vagina she was not wearing underwearobviously i couldnt do anything to upset her sensitive job and whatnot so i continued measuring around the sagging skin trying not to touch anything i didnt have to and then the smell hit me it was that old foosty musty old sock smell mixed with a fish market and some strong perfume i held my breath and told her the measurement and stood up so fast i got a head rush i then left her to her own devices to try on and went to get some sanitizer for my hands of course the husband was still chatting up the mannequin but i just smiled and nodded at him and

at my job at the membership desk we were having a credit card sign up contest whoever signed up the most people for credit cards over a one month period got a gift card to our store which is great because i get a number of groceries at my workplace quite frequently at the time of this story i was in second place i had cards done and my coworker had i was closing the last day of the contest and so it was just me behind the desk after six around seven or so that night an older woman came up with one of our card application pamphlets wonderful i take her membership card and her license and begin the twominute process as i open up her file a young couple of about thirty comes up behind her also with a pamphlet paydirt i was going to win this thing in the next five minutes now here is where everything goes to hell the old woman who was rather overweight and a little snippy with me to begin with began to shift side to side weird but okay suddenly she lets out what had to be the loudest longest fart i have ever heard it was wet it was like in the movies within a moment the smell reached me lord have mercy on my beloved nose i had the fight back a retch i see the couple behind her get hit by the wave of odor and cover their noses for a second before deciding that staying in line wasnt worth it and walking away rather quickly meanwhile the old woman started feeling behind her and touching her butt oh god no with a brief sorry i have to go she took her license from me and left and when she turned the leave i saw it a grayishbrown wet spot on the back of her pants this woman just crapped herself right in front of me but thats not the worst part when i looked down at the keyboard to exit her file i saw the spot on the counter where she grabbed her license from there was a wet mark from her finger to add insult to injury the sign ups were tallied up the next day my coworker won the contest by one sign up
in my small store mornings tend to be pretty slow this day was like most others with just a coworker and i as well as an intermittent guest or two during these times i do silly things just to keep morale up and make things interesting the phone rings and i go to pick up after a couple of rings but by the time i do the person has hung up i seize this as an opportunity to do a gag that i once saw in a looney tunes episode as a kid me speaking to no one on the other end gt you dont say you dont say you dont say you dont say okay have a good day hang up then my coworker with nothing else to do asks me what happened to which i inevitably reply he didnt say and get a deadpan expression from my coworker then in the corner of the store some lady begins cracking up like dying of laughter im not sure if it was the joke or the reaction from my coworker but it became one of those wheezing runningoutofair laughs i go over to help her and make sure shes okay and i swear there are tears in her eyes she manages to say no im fine im so sorry and leaves the store i guess in embarrassment while shes still laughing i wonder how many people she has replayed that dumb gag to since then
i work in an office supply store that also sells technology im the only one working in tech today so im just doing my rounds helping people out i notice a lady standing by the tablets so i start to make my way over to her next thing i know she lifts her arm and snaps her fingers like im a dog and she wants me to go to her usually that would make me immediately walk away but luckily she realized what she had just done and immediately says oh my god i cant believe i just snapped my fingers at you im so sorry i cant believe i just did that i say its fine and help her decide on a tablet boring story but it was nice to have a customer realize that im a person not a dog 
i worked at a telecommunications company a while back and just remembered this one i was helping a customer put a screen protector on his phone in front of his two kids around years old would be my guess and it was taking a while because im quite anal and need to do these things perfectly his kids kept pestering metheir dad with questions like whats he doing why is this taking so long i want to go to the pet store can you hurry up etc i look up from the screen protector to the kids and say just so you guys know if you ask somebody lots of questions and tell them to hurry up it usually makes them slow down the kids kind of look at me and their dad says kids do you know what he just said the kids shake their heads he just told you to shut up really nicely it absolutely was true and completely made my day i discounted his screen protector because i could
so ive been a shift manager at a retail store for about a year now but this happened about a month into my employment we are about minutes from closing on a freezing night in december we are talking below freezing when closing at this store there is only one manager and one cashier i look out the doors and there is a cop talking to teenage boys not my problem so i dont concern myself with it minutes later time to lock up close the last registers etc i go and lock the door and see the police car driving away with the siren going then i see the teenagers try to open the door i just locked they knock on the door gtsorry guys we are closed gtthat cop said we could stay in here though gtwell he should have talked to me about it before he left gtcome on man its freezing out here gtsorry guys nothing i can do felt kinda bad kus it was cold as fuck outside but it was just me and one cashier who was a teenage girl i didnt know why the cop was talking to them and i knew i could lose control of that situation if anything went wrong also we were fucking closed so i go about my business finishing the closing duties and then its time to go step outside let the cashier go home and then i see the cop again who then proceeds to yell at me for not letting the teenagers into the store after we closed i love retail edit real quick guys lets be honest the cop yelling at me was a dick move for sure but when he left his sirens were on so i assumed he was responding to a real emergency and perceived this as a non emergency he probably didnt check the hours of the store unfortunately the kids suffered from that hell no im not going after a cop for a misunderstanding again dick move to get pissed at me but i got over that shit within hours no need for anybody to lose their job or be reprimanded i did my job he was trying to do his thats just how retail is and being a cop is probably far more thankless

i worked at a grocery store at a full service meat counter this means if you wanted any type of meat steaks chicken fish etc not deli meats you had to get it from me behind a counter this place was also in a fairly rich neighborhood so we had plenty of entitled customers names have been changed in this article this is a long story ive been wanting to share for a while so apologies for the wall of text this is the story of the woman who worked only one day this took place right after a massive storm took out power all across town the town ended up without power for weeks and our store just happened to be one of the first places to get it back this woman was a regular customer but was not our typical clientele she was most likely living on welfare was very disheveled in appearance but not homeless and loved to come into our store every time she came in she would tell the cashiers how she was constantly applying for a job here and once they gave her a job everything would be perfect and her life would turn around after a few months of this bragging we decided to help her and actually gave her a job she seemed like a lovely lady and we were short staffed due to the storm i wasnt there when she was told she got the job but i heard she started sobbing and gave the store manager a hug thanking him over and over until she left on her first day there was another small storm this would be perfect for her as the rain usually keeps out customers limiting traffic so she can learn the basics easier however when the time came for her to clock in at she was nowhere to be seen we wondered where she was hoping she was able to make it here okay ten minutes later nothing fifteen minutes still nothing twenty minutes we were really starting to get worried something may have happened to her she finally shows up at looking for the working assistant manager kelly kelly was meat managers wife and very good at her job she usually trains the cashiers as she is also the manager of the front end so as kelly is teaching the woman how to use our clock in system at this point we had one that scanned our hands and fingerprints to recognize who was clocking in she mentions to the woman the fact that she is minutes late to her shift the woman casually says she is not late and that she is actually perfectly on time red flag count kelly then points to the screen on the hand scanner kellylook the clock here says you showed up here five minutes ago and all i did was give you your employee id womanwell your clocks must be calibrated wrong then you should really get that fixed red flag count so we work on getting her to a register to train her on the pos system as she is only supposed to be there until at she notices the younger kids who were there before here going on lunch break she decides that this is a good time to ask when she can take her lunch break womanhey kelly when can i go on lunch kellywell actually because youre only meant for a four hour shift company policy dictates you dont get a break you get minutes with no punch out for hours with punch out for hours and half an hour with punch out for and up womanreally theres no way i can go out real quick she tried to give kelly crocodile tears and puppy dog eyes red flag count kellyim sorry maybe later though youve only been here for an hour fast forward minutes to where she once again piped up to kelly womankelly do you think you can hold the front end down here i need to use the restroom kelly agrees and the woman left to the bathrooms which are located in the employee break room a few minutes later kids in the break room are reporting a terrible smell after fifteen minutes the woman emerged from the womens room with the distinct smell of cigarette smoke red flag count infinity our store is a strictly no smoking area if you want to smoke you have to do it outside kelly went into the ladies room to investigate the smell which had now started bleeding through to the meat department as seafood is right next to the break room and the woman had lit a cigarette enjoyed her smoke put it out on the toilet seat melting the plastic and didnt flush it away reasonably pissed off kelly brought the woman to the back room and asked her what that was all about she explained she thought that kelly was being unreasonable to her and since she couldnt take her smoke break with lunch she decided that it would be best to take it in the bathroom when asked why she had to melt the toilet seat her only response was where else am i supposed to put it you guys dont do the whole smoking indoors thing knowing that she was aware of the smoking policy when she voilated it was enough to force kellys hand into firing her she consulted with the store manager and he agreed when they gave her the news her reaction was what we had more or less expected of her now kellyim sorry woman but youre fired this is ridiculous youve only been here an hour and a half womanwhat no and ive been here two hours i got here at kellyyou showed up at you vandalized store property womanbecause youre being so unfair to me i should have a break ive been here long enough to get one kellyclearly very fed up with the interruptions nowwoman get out womanwell wheres my paycheck kellyyou will be able to get your paycheck next week on tuesday your time here has not been processed yet womanno i demand my money now i worked hard for it you owe me exactly kellywoman you will be able to pick up the check womanno fk you where is store manager i want my sm hearing the commotion left his office he didnt need to ask what was going on the small store made it very easy to know what was going on smwoman you will not be getting any money until tuesday next week womanthats against the law you have to pay me smjust leave already youre lucky we dont charge you for the property you destroyed womanwell then wheres my form smform womanso i can get me my unemployement smget out youre not getting any forms youre being charged for the property youve damaged so youre not getting any paycheck leave now she left to her car peeled out all over the parking lot this could be seen because the entire storefront is glass and she drove in front of the store flipping the bird at everyone before she left looking at the clock she didnt even last in retail past we never saw her again tldr this is what happens when customers start working in retail

i used to work in a home improvement store this store will bend over backwards to take care of customers even to the point of letting them walk out with product rather than offending them customer called on the phone one night cursing at me her son had bought gallons of the wrong color deck stain she had stained square feet before realizing it didnt match the rest of the deck of course it is my fault since i let him buy the wrong color i offered to give her enough stain stripper to get the stain off for free easy peasy right customer service oriented nope she wanted me to personally come out strip her entire deck restain it and do it all for free of course cursing me over the phone the entire time she explained it i stuck to me guns and offered enough stain stripper to remedy the situation free of charge i also suggested that next time she bought stain or paint we would have fixed the stain color for her if she hadnt used entire gallons paint is clearly nonrefundable the label on the can says so well according to her it was our fault that she sent her year old son to the store and we sold him the wrong color we were supposed to know that she and her husband had been in over the weekend and bought gallons of a different color she expected that we would associate her year old with her and sell him the right color her husband then called and said the same thing he at least didnt curse at me he did hang up on me and you guessed it went to the store manager the store manager gave him gallons of stain stripper applicators a refund of the previous gallons and apologized for us selling them the wrong color seriously
i saw another thread on here earlier about customers assuming retail workers are stupid or unintelligent because of the field we work in and it reminded me of something that happened a few years ago when i was working in my senior year of high school i was working at a local chain bakery in a fairly upscale neighbourhood one saturday when this happened for some backstory in our store our manager always told us to ask a lot of questions when people just asked for bread because otherwise customers had a habit of returning later and complainingtrying to score free stuff im not talking a lot of questions either it was literally stuff like seeds or no seeds brown or white bread thick or thin slice and we always moved and worked while talking so we could provide fast service one day i was working alone and this guy came in clearly in a massive hurry he was the only customer so i was doing my best to be courteous and get his items bagged up quickly for him asking the usual questions when he looks up and snaps at me are you fucking stupid or something i just want a loaf of bread youd better work on your customer service skills because it looks like youll be in sales for the rest of your life at this point im kind of in shock because i was honestly just going through the usual routine and trying to work quickly for him and no one had ever said anything like that to me at work before never mind the fact that i had good results in school and was on track to law school i was totally stumped about what to say to him whether to defend myself or just take it thats when this voice pipes up from over the mans shoulder its my english teacher and he says actually this cashier is a student of mine and in the top of her grade you absolute dick the man looks flabbergasted slaps his money down on the counter and stalks off with his loaf of bread i just looked at my english teacher and he smiled apologised for swearing and kept walking with his coffee edit there seems to be some confusion when i say law school in australia you can go straight from high school to an undergraduate bachelor of laws i meant my predicted high school results were high enough to get me into my preferred university for that course and yes the main point of contention for my story has almost nothing to do with my story classic reddit p
my coworker had what i think was a stroke at work today i was the only one who knew cpr because despite my repeated urgings for my company to hold classes on it it wasnt cost effective as you know its not really a living wage we earn so nobody could afford to pay for the classes themselves edit i just want to thank all of you things are in a better perspective for me today went to work and spent time talking about my friend with coworkers and i feel more at peace youre all right even when we do everything we can sometimes its just not going to be enough thanks again for making me see that update my son just came in here to tell me about this i want everyone to know how much their comments comfort and caring have meant these two days from all of your posts and advice i was able to say the right things to my friends widow when she came to see me at work today i let her know that the last thing he heard before he completely lost consciousness was me telling him we loved him that i was holding his hand and stroking his face and telling him it was going to be okay that he squeezed my hand back before he slipped away that was all because of the strength you all lent me to get through the day thanks for being you all of you p s im a woman and a mom but today firstly i am a redditor 
this story starts years ago i started working at a grocery store about years ago and this elderly couple used to come in all the time they were probably the sweetest couple i have ever meet they would always come in the morning together john would buy coffee get the morning newspaper and head over to flirt with the bakery girls marliese and i would talk with me about things going on in there lives after several months of working there i noticed that they hadnt been coming in as often as they used to one morning john came in by himself and i asked where his wife was he told me that she wasnt feeling well and stayed home i didnt think anything of it at the time it had been another full six months till i saw them both in the store together they did their shopping and come into my line to check out i greeted them both john replied but marliese ignored me and was trying to find her checkbook in her purse and was getting upset when she couldnt find it even though her husband had already written out his check they argued over this and john had to take her purse from her they paid for their groceries and left later into my shift i was talking to one of the cashiers who has worked at my store for a very long time and who knew john and marliese very well i told her about marlieses strange behavior and that something seemed off about marliese she was usually always cheery and in a happy mood the cashier told me that a couple years before i started working their marliese had been diagnosed with alzheimers and that is whats probably going on with her they would come in from time to time not as frequently as they used to i would notice that marliese personality would get worse and worse she was very argumentative with cashiers and she started to develop a short fuse but we all knew what was going on with her so we all super patient and understanding many months had passed and one day marliese came in without john and with who i assume was her caretaker later on we found out that john had passed away present time one day marliese came into the store her caretaker drove her there and sat down in the cafe marliese did her shopping and came up front to checkout she went into this new cashiers line and she immediately started complaining about the price of something instead of calling a manager over to fix the problem this new cashier decided he was gonna tell her that he changed to price to what she wantedeven though he didnt and he also double scanned some items on purpose when she left he told me what he did i immediately told my manager and my manager had to run out to the parking lot my manager had marliese come back in and gave her a full refund with an apology the new cashier was fired and trespassed 
i work as a cashier at a place you need to buy a membership to shop at i like this job a lot mostly because we seem to get a more pleasant class of customer than most retail stores of the people who come through my line are normal calm and understanding so anyways a woman and her son who looked about came through my line the woman kept complaining that her stomach hurt and at the same time the kid was keeping up a running commentary on everything she bought none of it was that entertaining so i kind of just ignored it the woman is getting visibly annoyed with the kids constant talking and then i scanned a can of tuna and all hell broke loose the woman was at this point looking pissed and the kid said something like eat some tuna mom then maybe your stomach wont hurt the kids mom then yells if you had a girlfriend maybe youd be eating some tuna i absolutely lost it i was doubled over not even trying to hide how hard i was laughing the kid didnt get it at all and looked really confused the woman points at me and yells he gets it he gets it i was gone somehow i managed to finish the transaction and send them on their way i hope that kid made it to a burn center

i work in retail at a store aimed at kids so naturally we deal with a lot of kids ive seen a lot of horribly behaved kids and equally horribly behaved parents one day a mom came in with two girls age ish and ish they shop around the girls pick out about worth of stuff that seem more like fun and cute clothes not necessities they check out and everything is great mom is really nice kids are nice out they go they come back in about minutes later and come up to the cash register i ask if they forgot something or needed something else and mom looks at the older daughter and says no but she has something to say to you older daughter sheepishly says im sorry i took this and hands me back a gift card she took from our display they dont have any money on them and im sure theyve been swiped many times i tell the girl thank you and take it back mom then looks at the daughter who stole the gift card and says the golden words we also need to return these things stealing is not allowed in this family all hell broke loose this girl threw one of the most impressive fits ive ever seen particularly for a an year old boots on the floor coat on the floor throwing herself on the floor screaming bloody murder and how much she hates her mom this store everything mom allows little sister to keep her stuff and is perfectly pleasant to us i attempt to make small talk during the return while this girl is throwing the fit of the week mom ignores her completely i wanted so badly to say youre doing the right thing but of course i couldnt after the return mom picks up her coat picks up her boots grabs her by the arm and marches her out of the store my coworkers and i stood in awe of an actual showing of awesome parenting that so rarely comes our way 
background when i was a teenager i used to work for a big chain grocery store as a bagger in the great state of texas i was at the time my managers name lets call him jim jim was a dick he treated us poorly like we were beneath him we never bagged quickly enough or returned from customers cars fast enough he claimed he was the type of manager you hate to have the story on this particular day we had a severe thunderstorm as we call them here in texas basically a torrential downpour with loads of lightning strikes and amazingly loud thunderclaps it was raining so hard my jacket was even soaked through even though i was wearing a poncho over it which i had to pay for it was winter it was quite cold out i was shivering teeth chattering this big built guy dressed like your typical biker comes through the lane im bagging for hes around probably over when i finish bagging his things i ask if hed like help out to his car bikerdude are you kidding me look at you youre already soaked you must be freezing theyre gonna make you go back out in this crap me well yeah i guess so bikerdude wheres your manager is it that little nerd with the clipboard over there the dry one in that stupid vest me through laughter yeah thats jim bikerdude hey jim bikerdude then storms over to where jim is standing bikerdude hey there jim look at this kid hes soaked to the bone and cold why are you making these kids go out in this mess jim hello um sir well to help our customers bikerdude well how bout you think of your employees for a quick second let them stay inside and warm up dry off cmon man be reasonable jim well sir our customers need help out to their cars and bikerdude you know what youre right they do i need help to my car and i want you to help me out there jim jim uhhhhh i have to uhhhhh stay and watch over the bikerdude whats that saying the customer is always right youre helping me out to my car jim by this time everyone was watching as jim and bikerdude strolled out with his basket i went outside and stood under the covered entrance area to watch jim get his bikerdude was in a truck which was parked in the verrrrry back of the parking lot by the time jim got back he was just as soaked as i was i acted like i was collecting carts and took jims from him he had a horribly sour look on his face which i of course enjoyed thoroughly bikerdude pulled by in his truck and waved me over and handed me a he told me to go take a break and dry off with a hot meal i said thanks and went back inside and asked jim for a break he begrudgingly told me to take as long of a break as i needed to dry off to this day i wonder what bikerdude said to him to get that reaction of of him some customers are actually cool
i work at a large wellknown department store right now i dont have a set department each week and am moved around in toys sports hardware etc today i was in hardware an older man came into the store wanting to buy some premixed paint he chose his colour a minty green and wanted me to shake it for him while waiting for his paint to be ready he suddenly asked have you heard of online romance at first i was apprehensive wondering where he might be going with this but i answered that i had he smiled and said when i was a kid a cute freckled redheaded girl lived across the road from me its been fifty years since i saw her but weve been talking online and were going to be meeting again in a few days can you imagine it its been fifty years he went on to say i built my house but im not very much into interior decorating so i havent really painted i decided since shes coming over that im going to have to ive already done the kitchen the bedroom the living room and now im doing the bathroom he glanced at the paint he was getting and laughed i dont know why i went with green tile for the bathroom i dont even like green once i showed him the mixed paint and he said it looked exactly the way he wanted he thanked me and went on his way i hope everything goes well for him and the freckled redheaded woman
really i had no idea i was checking out of the local home supply warehouse and used my store credit card for my purchase which consisted of a couple of pallets of fencing materials the cashier didnt look like she was new this particular store has everyone wearing orange vests and they are encouraged to decorate them hers was starting to look a little shabby but had lots of colored drawings of flowers all over it shed been here for a while and she was wooden she was doing her job quickly and efficiently but i might as well had been invisible no eye contact no talk no life taking my cue from her after my initial hello i stayed quiet when i pulled out my store credit card she asked me if she could see my id too ive been the victim of identity theft before my credit cards have my signature and a see id on the back even now i have a fraud alert on my credit so im very happy when cashiers ask to see my id and i always tell them thank you in a cheerful manner thank you so much for asking i said as i pulled out my id im always so glad when a cashier asks i know people give you crap for it but it really does mean a lot to me so thank you and she started crying it wasnt like she was bawling but her eyes teared up and her voice got that tremulous tone we have all experienced at some point in our lives there werent any other customers so we talked for a few minutes about how terrible customers can be and she regained her composure again apparently another customer had read her the riot act for something or another im not sure what and it had really hurt her ive told her about talesfromretail maybe we will see her here 
this one happened about a year ago when i worked the customer service desk at one of those warehouse stores now given that customers tended to purchase either large items or large amounts of items we provided flatbeds as well as oversized shopping carts one morning a perfectly respectable welldressed gentleman comes up to me wheeling in a flatbed with a bunch of wine and asks to get a refund on it okay so i grab a scan gun run around to his side of the counter thinking a wedding or something got cancelled while im scanning the bottles through he starts telling me why hes returning them all gtits my wife she drinks a lot i know she does it even though she tries to keep it secret i come home from work and she reeks of perfume and breath mints but i can still smell it on her i was checking our account statement last night and saw she spent a couple hundred dollars here and then i found the wine hidden in our basement shes killing herself shes killing herself and i cant stop her i finished scanning the bottles i remember it was because i thought to myself wow i guess booze really is the meaning of life i looked up and he was angry and on the verge of tears i didnt know what to say so i processed his refund and kind of awkwardly told him to have a good day which i realized afterward i shouldve left out it was sad
our store has the same sort of rewards system most other stores do free to sign up you get the sales prices and have coupons sent to you if you choose to provide that information you can provide as little as your phone number or more if you want the coupons if you dont want to give me your number thats fine you just dont get the sales prices which i explain enter mr grumps me hello did you have a rewards number with us grumps no me would you like to get one so you can get our sale prices today grumps no i do not give out my information me okay no problem just to let you know it wont ring up the sale prices grumps i dont give out my information i start ringing things up i see some of his stuff would be on sale it puts an asterisk next to each item on sale he sees it too because he stops me and jabs his finger at the screen grumps hang on that was cheaper on the shelf me yes as i said thats on sale with our rewards program are you sure you wouldnt like to sign up you can just do a phone number if youd like you dont have to give us anything else grumps thinks about it for a moment evidently these savings are worth it because he decides to sign up i put in his phone number and surprise hes already got an account with us not only that but he has provided us with all of his information in the past i spin the screen around me oh is this you grumps oh huh i guess it is me and is all this information still correct grumps yeah so much for not giving out your information
so back when i worked for a popular coffee shop one of my supervisors told me a great story about a lady who clearly wasnt grounded very well in our modern reality so this lady comes in with her child orders a drink for herself and a hot chocolate for her child the hot chocolate gets finished and put on the bar for the child who comes up and accepts it and being a little cutie squeaks thanks mister lady standing behind her child clucks her tongue and says to her child now now we dont thank the help my coworker looks at the kid says you have a wonderful day sweety then looks at her mother and says im sorry maam im going to have to ask you to leave the store now
another story from the used media store i work for the other day a man and his two sons came in with some games to trade now were required by law to take a valid id with any trade it creates a paper trail should anything come up as stolen later on the kids brought their games to the counter and i cheerfully asked for an id the older son called his dad over who well call history buff or hb for short me hi i just need a valid license or state id to get started hb my license me yes sir or a state id if you dont have one hb you know its illegal for you to ask me that me actually sir were complying with state law hb im talking federal law its illegal under the constitution me unfortunately sir im still required to have it before i can do any sort of trade for you today hb yeah ill give it to you im just trying to educate you people your age never know anything about history or laws this is the point where i really needed to bite my tongue and force that cheerful retail smile as he pulled a drivers license and a concealed carry license from his wallet he handed me the latter being a state issued id it was acceptable and i made no further comment on it i did his trade his sons chose a game and in an effort to kill them with kindness i cheerfully wished him a nice day to which he rudely replied yeah just study your history what a peach
i work at a a toy store i was working at the cash register a customer brings up a monster high doll to buy for those unfamiliar with monster high its pretty much barbies creepy monster cousins this particular doll was from a new line of oversized dolls about double the size of the regular ones that cost a bit more after ringing her up i tell her the total which comes to plus tax gtlady your wrong thats too much gtme its ringing up for was there a different price on the shelf gtlady the sign over there says they are she points towards the entrance area in the completely opposite side of the store of the doll department while i dont work in dolls i see enough of these dolls to know that is far too low the regular sized ones rarely are that cheap unless on sale or clearance so i let her lead me to in the direction she was pointed to a sign by the entrance gtlady see this sign says the sign in question was indeed about the doll she was buying an advertisement about the bigger line of dolls but no where did it say a price however the sign did say frightfully tall ghouls tall gtme im sorry but this sign doesnt say a price just that these dolls are inch tall gtlady it says you need to sell it to me for that much gtme im sorrybut that isnt a price but a height i cant sell you it for that much gtlady thats misleading you should sell me it for like the sign says gtme it says that it is inch tall that pointing to the sign is a symbol for inches not dollars gtlady how do you know that isnt dollars i want it for that price you cant have numbers that arent a price at this point i was frustrated this was an adult and somehow was unfamiliar with units of measurement or basic reading comprehension gtmethe sign doesnt say that it is dollars it says that it is inches double apostrophe means inches not dollars those are two different types of units i cant lower a price because you misread a sign gtladythis is ridiculous if you dont give me that price i am going to get you fined for false advertising gtme sorry i cant that is clearly not the price she glares at me and storms off in a huff kicking the sign as she goes 
im a manager at a wellknown clothingapparel store we get a lot of interesting customers a customer and her kids were at the register with one of our strongest cashiers a quietbutfriendly older woman with quite a few years of experience under her belt i was working on something at a nearby counter throughout the exchange the customer had around worth of merchandise to purchase and my cashier was going above and beyond in order to use every coupon the customer had across multiple transactions final total came to around so she had saved quite a lot of money already customer i thought these tops were cashier oh no theyre if you buy three you only bought two customer thats not what the sign says it just says cashier well lets go see the cashier takes the customer to the sign which was right near the cash wrap the sign sitting right in the middle of the tank tops in question states ribbed tanks for each in large text and for each in smaller text and they are the only tanks on the table customer so this says that the shirts on this table are if you buy three well i also got this shirt she pointed to a shortsleeved shirt that was on the back side of the table on lower shelves so they are all cashier no its just the tanks you only have two tanks so they are and that shirt is not on sale customer no she gestures emphatically across the store to the sign as theyve made their way back to the cash register at this point thats not what it says cant you read cashier yes maam it is im watching carefully at this point as the customer begins to get upset the cashier handles the situation very cooly but im starting to think i might need to intervene customer your signs are so misleading i cant believe youre not going to honor your prices cashier the sign says when you buy customer they are shes gesturing this entire time its really irritating to me cashier yes when you buy three of the same shirt customer i dont know why i shop here this store is horrible cashier im sorry youre disappointed did you want me to take off those tanks customer no i want them for cashier unfortunately theyre not unless you buy three unless you want to get a third i can either take them off or give them to you for each its up to you such an awesome cashier i love employees like this the customer continues to whine throughout the rest of the transaction after having the cashier remove the shirts from the bill she pays and goes to leave when the detectors at the door begin to activate as her sons pass through i check her merchandise and find no electronic tags left on her clothing complaining she walks through the door herself and with her bags and does not set off the alarm when her child follows suit however the system lights up she pulls a shirt out from his pants throws it at me and leaves in a huff um bye then tldr customer complains about on a purchase meanwhile her son tries to steal
two stories in less than a week which retail deity did i scorn which cardinal direction do i have to bow and pray to so i have a halfshift today hours covers the lunch rush and im working on the sandwich line we make all manner of sandwiches but one in particular is vastly more popular than all the others so much so that we tend to run out of the materials to make them within only a few hours some people apparently have taken to using unscrupulous methods to try and get one note stating exactly what the sandwich is will probably give away my place of business its not even that good tbph anyway the person in question was a young businessman who i swear to god walks straight up to my sandwich counter and pulls out a list of all things gtsbm sy business man i need sandwiches of popular sandwich roast beef turkey gtme sir i will be more than happy to serve you once ive helped the customers ahead of you points at the lineup of other people hes just tried to cut in front of gtsbm excuse me gtme i said gtsbm i heard you smart i dont have time for this do you even know who i am oh boy here we go gtme no sir im afraid i d gtsbh im the franchise owner from next town over you little st oh good one of these guys ive heard tell of them heck ive seen stories about them here on tfr but to be honest i thought they were like leprechauns everyones heard of one but never seen one for themselves to clarify we are a small independentlyowned bakery there are no franchises in the space of about five seconds im trying to decide what the best course of action would be to deal with this guy would be and it ended up being the worst possible thing i could do to the poor idiot i played along gtme oh dear im so sorry sir i wasnt told you ordered here wait here ill get the business owner hell want to apologize personally hey business owner the franchise owner from next town over wants to see you ive never seen a man backpedal so hard in all my life if hed backed off any faster he wouldve moonwalked out the storefront window 
this happened in the early s and is my first post to rtfr so i thought id give it a shot i worked at a chain familyowned grocery store i had been working through the ranks and was head cashier at the time which basically meant i figured out breaks and handled customers when the cashiers couldnt this fine summer afternoon i spot him this creepy guy anyway he was in line to one of our cuter cashiers who as soon as she saw him flashed her checkout light signaling for help backstory this is the disgusting part and i cannot deny or prove this however i had heard from several sources that this guy liked to go into the checkouts of cute girls stare at them for a bit then go home and while staring at their name on the receipt jerk off to them anyway back to the story as i saw the cute girls light flash i knew immediately what to do i waited a few moments until the man was committed to the line then beelined it straight to her register told her to sign out and go on break wasnt really her time to go it was more of an excuse to not arouse suspicion got him i knew the man had already placed his half gallon of milk and other sad groceries on the belt and couldnt escape his smirk deflated in front of my eyes like a child opening a box for christmas and it revealing a subscription to field amp stream magazine i gave him the heartiest hello how are you today smiling and making eye contact heres where i decided to push the awkward meter further i decided to maintain eye contact the entire time i rang him out he mumbled something incoherent but i didnt care i was beaming on the inside however my job was half done i still had to ring him out i mustve fumbled with that box of cereal for a few more seconds than i should have but i was not going to break that eye contact i literally felt around like a blind man while i maintained my eyelock onto him oh he started grunting and looked away multiple times but i felt like it was my civil duty to make him as uncomfortable as he made those girls thank god i had a bagger to help otherwise i wouldve had to bagged his items and break that eye contact after ringing him out for what felt like forever was really only items i handed him his receipt and when he went to grab it from me i maintained a firm grip on it looked him dead in the eyes pointed to my name on the receipt and said gt in case you didnt know my name is drweegee i hope i provided you with excellent customer service i let go of the receipt and watched him twitch off i think i saw a vein on his forehead explode the cashier came back and thanked me for helping her with him aftermath other cashiers and baggers apparently saw this whole ordeal and watched the entire thing transpire one of the other baggers came up to me later on saying he saw the man throw the receipt out when he got outside after aftermath a few weeks later i saw the man in queue for another females line immediately i went up to the cashier and told her to go on break flashing him a wink and a smile the man i kid you not placed his items on the floor turned and walked out edit holy balls gold many thanks edit just to clarify i have been out of retail for about years and have joined the lovely world of cubicle farms i will post as many stories as i remember from my retail past edit a word wow i did not expect for this post to blow up like this thank you all for your comments ill post more soon

years ago i worked as a salesperson for an electronics retailer i had worked there a while so i knew the products and policies pretty well i prided myself in genuinely helping customers as best as i could i was very fortunate to have an awesome store manager he treated both customers and employees fairly if someone treated him with respect he would go out of his way to help them out however he was no pushover he had no tolerance for bs overall he was a great boss who always trusted our judgment and would help us out whenever needed one day a gentleman came in and asked to return a rather expensive cassette recorder i did say that this was years ago he handed me the box which was old worn and faded i opened it and found that the recorder was in equally poor shape scratched and dented through years of use i politely asked when he bought it customer i just bought it last week from the wear and tear i can see clearly that this recorder is easily a year old likely more at this point i know for sure that hes trying to scam me regardless i stay completely polite and professional me okay could i please see your receipt customer i lost the receipt but i just bought it last week now we do have some discretion on what returns we could accept however this was way past the line it was too badly damaged to ever restock was quite expensive and was well past the day return policy without a receipt there was no way anyone in the store was accepting that return me im sorry sir this item appears to be very old and damaged i cannot accept this return without a receipt he responded as you might expect customer i want to see your manager at this point i should point out that my manager was built like a tank around foot inches tall around pounds quite muscular while he was very nice he could also be extremely intimidating if he wanted to be there was no way that my manager would put up with any bs from this customer as such even though the customer asked to speak to the manager i was pretty sure it wasnt a good plan as such i politely responded as genuinely helpful as i could me i dont think you do customer what i said i want to see your manager me yes sir i heard you i just dont think its a good idea customer get me your manager me i recommend against it customer now okay i tried my best i called out to my manager who had been listening to the whole conversation from the back room me manager could you come out here my boss stomped from the back room towards the register slowly and rhythmically the footsteps echoed through the store stomp stomp stomp the customers eyes widened as he saw a large angry man emerge from the back room stomp stomp stomp he walked up to the customer looked him right in the face and loudly asked manager what customer err uh i uh wanted to return this manager pointing at me well what did he tell you customer uh well he said no manager then what are you asking me for without another word he walked quietly back to his office in the back room i politely asked the customer if there was anything else i could help him with the customer said no and quickly left 
have been lurking for a while now but finally decided to share some of my stories from years of retail this happened a few years ago so ill try my best to recall it as it happened a bit of background info for context this was in a very bilingual city english amp french with the rural areas around the city being either very english read redneck or very french their own kind of special without getting into the politics this can sometimes cause some tension my first language is english but i am bilingual i was working at a large canadian outdoor equipment retailer in the cycling section this day two middle age guys walk in and right from the outset i could tell this was going to be interesting they were dressed in the equivalent of john deer tshirts with camo hats on one does pretty much all the talking so ill refer to him as ch now if we sold hunting or fishing gear that would be one thing but were more of the campingclimbingbackpack around europeyuppy store so they were a little out of place they stroll into the bike section and i m greet them just as i would any customer m hi can i give you a hand with anything today ch we need some tube patches and tubes for our bikes m okay our patches are just over here we walk over to the patches and i start into my spiel m so weve got two types of patches our inhouse brand at x and other brand at y i hand ch a box of each so he can check them out all seems to be quite normal so far ch what is this m what seems to be the issue ch pointing to the back of the box the instructions are in french theyre supposed to be in english m a little taken a back well as you can see the instruction are just on a piece of paper sitting inside the clear box im sure the other side of paper has the english instructions ch what are you guys trying to pull here the english is always supposed to be first m seeing where this is going but trying to play it off well these are all made in china so im sure some factory worker has just placed them in with no regard for what side faces out ch this is unacceptable french is a second class language and should always come second to english the government even says so im quite taken aback at this and get a little bit defensive because im not really in the mood to tolerate discrimination m i have to disagree with you sir french is not a second class language it is protected as equal to english ch no english always has to come first at this point one of my managers who is super nice well call him sn has been lurking and overheard that the interaction has gotten a little heated and decides to step in i take a step back and observe sn in french good afternoon gentlemen what seems to be the problem here ch excuse me at this point i cant tell if hes come over to make a point by speaking french or what is going through his head but its getting good sn in french again is everything alright over here i just thought i would see if i can assist in any way ch do you see a moustache on my face shit has hit the fan sn realizes he has made a mistake but its too late ch storms out of the store in a huff leaves the patches im standing a ways back so sn comes over to me to debrief sn what just happened there m well they were just saying how french is a second class language and i disagreed with them sn oh i though they were saying that as french people they felt like second class citizens m nope not at all sn so i pretty much did the worst thing possible there didnt i m yep hope you enjoyed my first story ill share more if it does well edit ok this did much better than expected thanks everyone will be sure to post another one next time i get the chance edit formatting

unlike most of my memorable transactions that leave me this close to walking out this lady made my day i was charging in a rather blah mood today when i notice that the customer headed for my register had thee coolest workout leggings ever they were superhero leggings in case yall are curious so i charge her rather small transaction while i start the small talk every customer gets instead it takes off into one of those did we just become best friends conversations where you get along extra well at one point i mention her apple watch something ive been wanting for a while now she had it in the exact color combo that ive been after she tells me she got it back when it was on sale i tell her i remembered that sale and that id tried going after work but that they were already sold out and they wouldnt give me a raincheck she says really hmm they gave me one i ended up having to drive a few cities over to pick it up but i got it the conversation shifts and eventually she leaves the store i continue charging for about half an hour when she comes back in holding up a receipt saying i found it i found it shes saying this as she heads to my register im really confused because she wasnt returning anything or had any other reason to need a receipt when she was here gtme huh gtsuperhero lady i found my raincheck here you can have it i got two of them because i was going to buy two its good until the end of next month now you can get the watch too in retrospect our conversation was a bit long considering the amount of things she was purchasing and i do remember her digging through her purse for a while even though she paid pretty quickly with a debit card im guessing she was trying to find it while she was at my register it just really blows my mind that people can be this considerate she came back in after about half an hour maybe more just to give me that receipt she couldve been home or having lunch or anywhere else im sure i dont have to tell you guys how horrible people can be especially in retail but today i saw the other end of that spectrum 
it was christmas eve and lucky me i was organizing the dog shoespeople will steal one and only one shoe customer excuse me what time do you open tomorrow me were closed tomorrow in fact were closing in half an hour customer that is unacceptable i need a manager me sure just a second i flag her down from the next aisle manager whats the problem customer i want to shop tomorrow manager were closed tomorrow but you can always use our website customer ill be here no matter what the next day one associate and a manager come in for an hour to feed the animals they hear someone banging on the door its the customer from yesterday manager tells her theyre just feeding the animals and that the store is closed he locks the door and gets back to work the customer starts ripping at the seal around the door and kicking the glass the police were called and they took her away in handcuffs im sure she had a lovely christmas we had holiday hours posted since halloween

this isnt my story this one is from my customer service manager in a store i where i used to work many years ago she worked in a store in a big regional town in the north west of australia and witnessed this little spectacle also some coarse language so this is a big supermarket and very busy the express checkout was set out in such a way that everybody lines up in one long queue and gets called to the next available register its the middle of summer so its hot like cf theres one poor mum with a toddler who has been a little jerk all through the store tantrums screaming the whole bit terrible twos or some such mum and kiddo line up in the express queue kid still shrieking and mum has enough its hot shes tired shes over it she gives the kid a swift smack on the bottom the screaming stops and mum gets a few moments of piece the woman behind her sniffs and says very haughtily in germany we dont smack our children mum turns around and yells at her yeah well in australia we dont gas our fucking jews you could have heard a pin drop the store goes dead silent and neither the german woman nor angry aussie mum say another word to each other
 our store closed at pm christmas eve and at pm this man comes up to me panicked asking me where we had a rc starwars toy as i was well aware we were sold out for over a week on the item i told him this he asks me to check the back and i tell him it would be no use as we had not gotten any in all week and there was no freight coming in on christmas eve the man looks at me dead in the eye and told me i was heartless and ruined his childs christmas this of course is not the first time i had been told this and wont be the last time either since i looked like i was not worried about this the man stormed off and demanded a manager fire me for ruining his kids christmas which did not happen my manager told me i should at least look sorry and i told him i would if i was but it is not my fault he waited until minutes from our closing time to go christmas shopping for his kids presents i am not responsible for his poor planning and said piss poor planning on his part does not constitute an emergency on mine the manager quipped back damn i forgot you are a military brat i laughed as he told me to just keep cleaning up tldr man waited minutes until store closed to shop for his kids christmas presents we were sold out of a toy he wanted i got blamed for ruining christmas because i did not look sorry he told a manager to fire me did not work out the way he wanted 
i work for a chain which has just a few stores open nationwide this means that the corporate ladder isnt that high and that store managers have a lot of freedom to exercise their own judgement this can be awesome or it can really suck it depends on whose side the manager is on here is something that scared the crap out of me this story takes place on a tuesday morning our store opens at am and at our first customer walks in from now on referred to as al for angry lady im just chilling at the register since theres not too much to do at the moment and shes walking around the store looking at items this is when another customer walks in and comes up to me hes a regular so we exchange pleasantries he has some questions about a product so i talk to him about it and answer all his questions he says thank you and leaves this all takes about minutes so the time is now after he leaves al comes up to the counter looking pissed off gt al how come i had to wait so long gt wut she wasnt anywhere near the counter or even in my field of view how the hell am i supposed to know that she wanted help gt me im sorry i didnt know you were waiting to be helped i can check out your items right now gt al this is unacceptable im a very busy woman and you people shouldnt waste my time like this gt me im very sorry ill try and get you checked out as soon as possible gt al let me talk to your manager you need to be more professional gt what the hell lady if youre busy just let me check out your items and then leave gt me sure i can get my manager for you but if youre in a hurry i can get all your stuff checked out right away gt al nope i want to speak to your manager gt now just to set the scene my manager is and built like an ox if hes mad youd better hope that its not at you i page the manager and he comes over gt mg what can i help you with gt al this is unacceptable ive been waiting here for minutes and ive received no help from your employee you need to hire more professional people gt mg gets a really stony look gt mg im so sorry maam that certainly is unacceptable throwthree why has this lady been waiting for so long gt me well i was just helping ano gt mg no that is just not acceptable were you the one who locked up last night gt all of my wat and yes i lock up every night gt me well yes but what has this got to do with gt mg well then were going to have to fire you gt at this point i had no fucking idea what was going on i really had no idea what to say so i just kind of stood there with my mouth open mg then turned and started talking to al gt mg im so sorry we open at and its right now so if youve been waiting for minutes then clearly throwthree did not lock up correctly last night this is a huge security risk for the company and he needs to be fired can i have you sign documents confirming that you were able to walk into the store outside operating hours gt ho lee shit this was around the time that i closed my mouth al looked perturbed gt al no im late ill just come back later and with that she walked out of the door leaving her items on the counter my manager just grinned at me and went back to his office that was one of the wtf moments ive had working there i went from bored gt annoyed gt confused gt scared gt angry gt happy in the span of like minutes at least my manager has my back
just for some background i have a skin condition which means that the top layer of my skin is often very sorelooking and cracked in places however this is totally noncontagious and doesnt pose a risk to anyone beyond looking bad i was working the till today when a man in his s came up to the till im me customer is grumpy man or gm gtme good afternoon did you find everything you were looking for gtgm remains silent gtme ltputs everything through till gives total puts hand out for money he was giving megt gt gm disgusting that is gtme sir gtgm points at hand you your hand you shouldnt be allowed anywhere near a till like that why dont you try washing them he then proceeds to go off on a rant about it for a good minute making a number of very insensitive remarks about me before mocing down the counter to pack his stuff at this point i felt terrible and i was doing everything to not break down into tears in front of everyone now behind him was a kid who cant have been more than or i could see him watching this man and then me then he started rather loudly asking his mum gtkid mummy why is the man being mean hes being mean to the lady people shouldnt be mean now at this the man turned back round to face the till and was giving this kid filthy looks then the kid studies my hand and comes out with gt scales cool youve got snake power i love kids certainly cheered me up if anything else 
i work as a cashier at a high end grocery store in a very affluent area most of our customers are young professionals and wealthy older people most of whom are wonderful easygoing allaround nice people but as with any retail establishment we have several customers that would best be described as devilspawn or intolerable buttheads earlier this week our store was experiencing its daily midday rush and i was on a register trying to funnel the hungry mobs and their bags full of kale out the door as quickly as possible despite how busy we were i do my best to make friendly albeit brief conversation with everyone who comes through my line smiling and being personable ive found tends to make the whole checkout process much more pleasant for everyone involved i was ringing up a young couple and their extremely polite year old son i jokingly told the boy that he should apply for a job his parents laughed saying that he could finally start paying them the rent he owed them i laughed too saying something about children being terrible roommates and soon sent them on their way after everything was finished the older blonde woman behind them in line began chatting with me as i scanned and bagged her groceries besides me telling her that she looked nice today our conversation was pretty typical some benign discussion of the weather and other standard smalltalk i handed over her receipt and told her to enjoy the rest of her day then she surprised me by asking if there was a manager available to speak to c customer m me gtm pointing to my manager behind the customer service desk thats managers name right over there she can take care of pretty much anything you need have a good one gtc thank you i just wanted to discuss my experience here today uh oh in my experience customers only ask to speak to a manager if they want to complain about an employee or some perceived injustice at this point im replaying our interaction in my head trying to pinpoint exactly what had happened that upset her as she made her way to the cs counter i began to clean my workstation trying to subtly keep an eye on the conversation between her and my boss though just barely in my peripheral vision i saw the woman point a finger in my direction causing my heart to momentarily stop my manager nodded some kind of agreement and the woman walked out of the store at this point i was terrified worried that i had said or done something worthy of being reprimanded without even realizing it i looked over at my manager giving her a quizzical look doing my best to remain cool she made her way towards me every footstep causing anxious beads of sweat to gather around my collar gtm using the most nonchalant tone i could muster what was that all about gtmanager well she just wanted to tell me that you were doing a great job and that she wished everyone she met was as friendly and enjoyable as you and that this is her favorite highend grocery location because of how helpful our staff is so keep up the good work relief washed over me so quickly i felt dizzy gtm that was sweet of her i thought id managed to piss her off somehow gtmanager i thought you looked worried haha she also wanted me to give you this she handed me a gift card with a small handwritten note folded around it the note read thank you for making me smile enjoy lunch on me today god bless even writing this story i still cant believe anyone could capable of being so generous gift card thats lunch all week and appreciative of just a few nice words and a smile its always nice to know that not everyone thinks of retail workers as mindless drones put upon this earth to serve them tldr i was nice to a customer and she payed for my lunch for a week 
this is another tfr of my time at sub restaurant i had been there a little under a year and had become the opener basically this meant that i was there about hours before we opened with the manager on duty usually the store manager this new girlng had been hired over summer break and this was her first job obviously we didnt expect her to know much about working a job and told her that small mistakes were fine so long as she learned from them wellwe were in for a fun ride day ng requested to come in at instead of the usual time of because she had one last class to finish no problem lunch rush will be done and there will be plenty of downtime to train her she arrived at saying her car broke down and she had to get a ride no problem sometimes thing just happen that are out of our control rest of the day goes by without incident day ng calls off because she needs to go get her car fixed usually not a problem because again things happen and she needed that car to get to work problem was she called minutes after she was scheduled to come in day we are finally able to start some real training i am showing ng how to do stuff in the back of the house the things the customers dont want to see and we are making small talk i mention that i am the opener and she hits me with this gtng i think i would be a great opener this job doesnt seem too hard gtme i was here a year before they would even consider letting me be the opener first thing you need to do is learn these lower jobs and prove you can do them day friday our busy day ng was going to be our sub runner easiest job in the store call name and sub and bring to table so myself and the more experienced employees could focus on making the subs she calls and says she cant make it because her friend invited her to a party when did she call minutes before her shift was supposed to end at this point the store manager was ready to fire her but decided to give her another chance day ng calls about an hour before her shift progress at lastsarcasm to tell us she cant make it that day well that is it the store manager has had it so she tells ng that she is fired she cannot be counted on for anything and that she needs to learn how to work before she can get a job ng begs for one last chance the store manager agrees but tells her that if she calls off again that she is fired day yepyou guessed it called off about an hour into her scheduled shift when she dropped off her uniform she said she had no idea why she was fired gtng i mean i cant be expected to just end my social life my friends are more important than any job why cant the store manager see that gtme get out just get out that experience made me die a little inside tldr girl calls off out of the days she officially worked for the restaurant and wonders why she got fired update wow never thought this story would be so popular edit formatting
hi again tfr the more grocerystore cashiers i read about the more memories i am reminded of during my years in that special circle of hell i was reminded of my very favorite hated customer as i mentioned in my bad story earlier our grocery store had a very lenient policy on returning food the day steak man arrived was the day it was truly tested gtsm hello i would like to return some steaks they were too fatty gtme certainly do you have your receipt gtsm in a challenging tone no i do not gtme okay thats alright do you have the steaks gtsm no they were too fatty they were about can you just give me that gtme well sir i cant process your return if i have no proof of you purchasing the steak anything would do even the styrofoam packaging gtsm are you stupid or something no we cooked the steaks yesterday ate them and realized they were too fatty they were new york strips i decide to ignore the fact that ny strips are known for well the strip of fat along the side and pick the better lowhanging fruit gtme sir let me make sure i get this you bought steaks cooked them ate them in their entirety then decided afterwards you wanted a refund gtsm yes they were about cash please gtme sorry sirif you ate the steaks and have no receipt or proof of purchase i cannot refund you i am sorry was not sorry for purposes of length i wont go further but we spent a solid minutes years in retaillife going back and forth on this return finally the manager is free to come over and talk to steak man manager explains the same thing to steak man and apologies is not sorry steak man does this weird angryman scream and storms away you would think that would be the end of it right of course not five minutes later i see steak man making a beeline for my counter gtsm i want a refund the soda machine ate my dollar gtme sorry sir we have no control over the vending machines i did not know it was acting up so ill go put an outoforder sign but youll have to take up the refund with ltvending machine companygt sm proceeds to fly off the handle in a rage talking about how were trying to scam him that we rigged the soda machine on purpose to get him back for just trying to get a refund threats to management threats to corporate blahblahblah as hes ranting i reached for my wallet gtsm what are you doing gtme ltpulls out and hands it to smgt here sir if i give you a dollar will you leave you will have nothing left to complain about and this is getting exhausting mr steak man smugly took my dollar and left without a word i never saw him again after that tldr paid a customer to leave me alone edit linked my story thanks for the tip
this is why i hate year old girls even though i was one of them at one time years ago im a manager at a local clothing store here and at the age of i feel like im not as inpatient with younger customers as the older people are that work there so there i was standing at the front desk because we were short handed and i watched the desk to let the other girl take lunch nothing is really happening besides a group of young teen girls come in with older women who i assumed was moms and i pay no attention to them because what problems could they really cause i see them just grabbing all types of clothes and going to try them on they come out and continue browsing our wonderful selection but didnt bring the clothes back out with them a pain in my ass but not really that big of a deal and i was in a good mood that day out of the corner of my eye i see them taking shirts holding them up to see how they would look and then discarding them onto the floor but i am still in a good mood so i simply say hey to get their attention and when they look at me i simply say dont do that cmon be cool minutes later i see them doing the same shit so i walk over and tell them that if they dont stop i will have no choice but to make them leave nothing was getting me down that day a few more minutes pass and i see them kind of hiding behind displays and they are doing the same exact shit i mean cmon i spot their mothers on the other side of the store so i figure i will stop it all right now by going over their head i approach these woman and this is the conversation mmom mmom me excuse me ladies m oh we dont need any help me ok but i am here to tell you that the young ladies you came in here with are about to be kicked out if they dont stop throwing the merchandise in the floor simple enough i walk back to the desk and see them approaching the teenage brats and i go about my business m and m approach the desk and have some pissed off looks on their faces m how dare you tell these girls that you would kick them out of the store me i told them to stop twice m it still gives you no right m this isnt your store i want to speak with the manager me ok then how can i help you m by getting the manager me thats me m you know you dont have to be such a smart ass all you had to do was watch the girls and they probably wouldnt have done it me but thats not my job m yeah well we are leaving right now and we will not ever come back here again you lost customers me have a nice day this is the reason i hate teenagers and their stupid parentsnot all parents just the stupid ones but it always helps to smile as you wave goodbye even when they give you the finger 
so i used to work in a store that sold used comic books a great abundance of used comics sometimes our stock would get so overcrowded that we would clear them out with a buy ten get ten free deal they were all so its not like we lost that much in sales it was a good way to clear inventory as you can imagine comic nerds like myself saw it as a great way to get comics for and some comic nerds not like myself saw it as a chance to get comics for a customer rolls in with his mountain of white cardboardbacked comics from the ss and i stare down the tower then i stare at him impressed that he would go through the effort of sorting through the bins to draw such a massive amount i know that this would be a test a test of my efficiency and a customers patience then i tell him the bad news im going to have to scan all of these individually you see our used comics arent all under one single barcode there are several scattered about and in order to keep inventory clear we have to scan every comic as a separate line item if i just scanned one and set it as it would create a massive disparity in our inventory he looks at me and he tells me i understand a formality to be sure for even good men have their breaking points so i start scanning ten normally then ten that i have to go and manually reduce the price to one by one ten normal ten reduced ten normal ten reduced at around comics scanned in our old clunky windows xpoperated register system crashes freezes up ill have to redo the entire ticket rescan all those comics i had sorted into neat piles i look at the customer and i tell him im sorry my system crashed im gonna have to redo all of this i await the fury the cursing the anger the impatience it would be justified its taken a long time to even come this far and i had barely crossed the halfway point however he looks at me his eyes cloudy with visions of s wolverine and s batman and he tells me alright and here my friends i tell you that on this day in a transaction that took over minutes to clear a customer did not lose their patience nor blame a sales associate for technical malfunctions on this day a customer knew the great burden they were pushing onto a sales associate and said let my quiet understanding be the support to help you through this difficult time in a world where others may fly into a rage over a misswiped credit card there was one who understood on this day a customer and a sales associate became brothers in blood godspeed purchaser of comics may your boxes bulge with paper and ink may your shelves grow heavy and buckle under the weight of superheroes
i work in an adult shop in a predominantly gay area of my city i have done a few stories you can find them todays tale is kind of hard it was one that really tugged at my heart strings and left me wondering if i could have done more i have a pretty laid back and accepting attitude to people and to sexuality i have friends who are gay lesbian trans etc i suppose this comes in handy in my job and in the area of town in which i work but events over the last few weeks have left me wishing that i could do more still not sure what more i could have done though a couple of weeks ago two young men and entered the shop we got to chatting and one bought a few items came up in the conversation that they were part of the furry community furries are a community of people who like to become animal alter egos of sorts they have an animal that is their other side this may involve sex play one of the young men was very vocal about his sexual exploits but the other young man was very quiet and unassuming kind of out of nowhere the quiet young man who shall be henceforth be known as furry said i dont really like sex me really furry no i just dont get any thrill out of it me well you are still young you just may not have found the things you like yet furry i dont like sex i am only ever comfortable in my furry outfit in fact i hate my penis ok then what does one say to this me so i suppose in your outfit you can just be asexual you dont have to be a boy you can just be your character right furry hey you get it yeah that is exactly how it is me and i suppose if you hate your penis why would you want to be involved in an act like sex in which it plays kinda the main role furry hey you really do get it me darl have you ever heard of gender identity issues furry yeah and before you say more yeah i think i do have some issues me have you talked to someone about it furry no not really its kind of hard how do you talk about this to someone me i think you should and it should be someone other than an old broad like me in an adult shop you do know that there are places around here where you can talk to people just like you dont you you are not alone in this furry yeah i suppose me how about your family have you spoken to them furry no it is kind of hard you know me yeah i get it but i really think you should get some help because it sounds to me like you are talking sex change am i getting this right furry yeah you are i really want to be a girl i want my penis gone it shouldnt be there i went to my trusty smart phone and immediately looked up a few numbers i knew for groups and help gave him all the details and made him promise to call and talk to someone before he left the shop i came out from behind my counter and he extended his hand to thank me i pulled him into a hug and said hey i am a hugger as i gave him a big hug his face lit up and he said so am i well today he came back he was alone this time and came to tell me that he has his first appointment with a counselor tomorrow he plans at this stage to go through the entire gender reassignment process who knows it may change with counseling but at least he is getting some help and has someone a little more qualified to talk to than me he also told me his girls name that he intends to use it was a lovely name edit wow i did not expect this response and to the person who gave me gold i am ever so grateful actually got tears in my eyes reading the comments and to have this reposted in the furry subreddit as well reddit is just awesome and again thanks edit just in the door from work and am amazed at the response this has received i sincerely thank all those who have made such lovely comments about me i just wanted to give some background about myself i have grown up with a lot of glbtiq friends i have been lucky in life in this regard because it has taught me tolerance and acceptance not just of peoples sexual preferences but of all things in life this when i have two brothers who are homophobic and racist and a mother who still asks me why i hang around with those kinds of people i am also lucky in that my gorgeous man is the same as me i have lost friends to aids and have friends who are hiv positive i have lost friends to suicide because they thought no one was there for them when they came out my attitude has also helped with my current job ok it is a pretty dead end job in many respects but it does allow me to meet some really amazing people i was looking out at the rainbow flags lining the street where i work today and thinking about the comments i had read this morning and i was wishing the world was more like reddit you all seem to be so accepting spread the love people listen to your friends give them a shoulder to cry on or a hug if they need it celebrate diversity people because lets face it if we were all the same the world would be an awfully boring place

nothing well im sorry to hear that and im gonna do everything i can to make sure the rest of your visit is fantastic i say i like bad customers i thrive on them a good challenge provides some spice to the day im ready for this i check on them about once every five minutes for the next half an hour each time i go check on this table i get a dirty look from the dad and an increasingly cheerful yet still dismissive response from the mom thats cool as long as theyre happy im happy i take pride in my job and as long as they are enjoying themselves its no skin off my nose so i go to another table and start schmoozing them were getting a good conversation going and as im talking i feel a kid tug on my arm and tells me he wants to take the challenge boom i think this family is willing to pay to let their six year old eat obnoxiously hot chicken wings therefore they are enjoying themselves therefore we have brownnosed our way out of the woods i excuse myself from the table i was talking to and approach the original family with the required waiver they sign it minutes later the wings come out of the deep fryer normally i make it my goal to leave no more than about seconds between deep fryer and mouth when it comes to this challenge but this kid looks about six years old and im gonna give him a break so i let those wings sit for a good or more minutes to cool down i lay the wings down on the table hop on the microphone rally the restaurant attention nonequity chicken wings chain restaurant we have our first non equity hot chicken wings challenge of the night tell them how old you are bud i hold the microphone to the kids face which i never do but i figure im going all out for this table if i keep this up i might get a kudos email and he goes im six years old the restaurant goes nuts this could not be going better this kid is ballsy as hell they are getting all kinds of good attention from the whole dining room and restaurant were good i start the timer the kid takes one bite and gives up im not suprised at all but all of a sudden the mom starts insisting that the wings were too hot temperature hot and that it wasnt fair so i offer to let him try again with the same wing basket once they cool down but the kids done so mom decides its her turn by the way we never ever ever ever ever let people attempt the challenge when someone has already tried with that basket its not fair to other challengers but at this point im willing to do anything to keep this family happy so here i am back on the microphone alright guys carlito is done challenging for the night but thats okay because his mom gladys is gonna take up the torch and finish them for him again crowd nuts still killing the game i hit the timer she takes one bite done hop on the mic again and get both carlito and gladys two more rounds of applause i come back about ten minutes later to hand out some high fives and congratulate them for trying and the mom tells me that it would absolutely make this kids day if he could get a t shirt just for trying the t shirts are for people who actually do the challenge and i have definitely told people who missed their time on the stop watch by all of about seconds that they would be going home shirtless but for this lady i went and asked my manager who gave me the go ahead i come back with the shirt display it proudly for the table they are all smiling and i give it to the kid the kid was happy but now his brother and sister want to try for the shirt i immediately see where this is going this lady is about to make me sit there and watch each of her kids take one bite of spicy wings give them each a shirt and if not then shes gonna fuss i tell her no unfortunately its against the rules for me to let more than one person attempt the challenge on one basket of wings and she goes with kind of a imdoingthistobenefityoubecauseyouarecompletelyatmymercy smirk were just trying to save you guys wings is all and then it hits me this lady things that the challenge is free its not its not even free if you finish your wings on time i have never suggested on the microphone or at any point that its free and the waiver that she has now signed twice has disclosed that she will be paying for it nothing nobody no where has made any indication that these wings are free and im about to get lit up for it when shes figures it out so in preparation i retreat to the kitchen because ive run out of ideas by the time i come back out this table is looking angrily at their tickets i try to sneak by them on my lap around the dining room but she stops me and demands why werent we disclosed that we would be charged for the challenge at this point my creativity is about nil so i just say its on the waiver you signed instead of so let me get this straight you thought the wings were free even though nobody here even finished them under which circumstances it might be understandable that you would think you might get free wings but because you signed a waiver you acknowledge that that is not the case and youre still walking out of here with a t shirt that you didnt earn i hand the dad the waiver he goes up to my manager and hands her his ticket with cash and twenty dollars missing and says if you dont like this you can shove it wherever you want which causes my manager to calmly and cooly ask one of the cashiers to get down their license plate info say what you want about this manager shes not popular but shes certainly no easy floozy five minutes later gladys is back in the restaurant with a twenty dollar bill in her hand backpedaling like a mom who is afraid to get arrested for theft in front of her kids just take the money we dont want any confrontation we have our kids in the car last thing i hear my manager say just as calmly is keep your money we wont call the police but we still reserve the right to refuse service 
heres a tale from the customer side i worked retail for many years and know the big box system pretty well i always have a receipt for my returns exercise patience with new people and say thank you to those that help me i never thought i would have to resort to violence yesterday was i was wrong i am at a very busy home improvment store that has two returns lines it is fathers day and the store is packed my return is a snap ring plier set that broke on first use i was just going to exchange it for the same product i had my receipt and had waited about minutes in line for my turn three people in front of me was a beligerent gentleman of color he was returning a sump pump that was not working it was also covered in what looked to be dried sewage and smelled horrible the guy did not have a receipt and they called up the plumbing manager for assistance this took a good five minutes and the guy was starting to get more and more agitated the manager arrived and got his story his sewer line broke and backed up into his basement he was using a standard sump pump used for keeping ground water pumped out to pump out raw sewage this wont work as it is not designed for that the manager explained this and looked at the pump it was not even one they sold he didnt buy it there the manager said there was nothing they could do for him except sell him a sewage pump the guy didnt take this well and started screaming profanities and questioning the plumbing managers mothers heritage the manager walked away and left the guy there with his horrible smelling pump the next two people get thier returns done and the guy is still there getting madder and muttering something under his breath its my turn for returns and the cashier is visibly upset and shaking the other return person called for a store manager as im starting my return the guy interrupts and yells bitch get the fucking manager up here before i start killing mutha fuckas up in here he is litterally less than two feet from me i turned and said hey there is no need for that he then said ima startin with you and reached under his shirt i snapped and hit him square in the face he dropped everything and was on the floor i got on top of him and pinned his arms down another customer ran over and from behind me sees a gun in his wasteband and grabs it to keep it away from the guy the manager arrived and some others had already called i stayed on top the guy for a good minutes until the police arrived in that time the guy tried everything to get away he struggled threatened me my family tried kicking out anything but i kept him pinned the police got there and cuffed him and me once witnesses got the police informed of the real story i was let go come to find out this guy was a gang member with two warrants for two separate murders he likely would have killed me and a few others with me they said he likely wouldnt be prosecuted for this incident since he has two murder charges already happy fathers day tldr stopped a shooting at the hardware store

hey tfr ive got a good one for you today and i still get giddy thinking about it i work at a bank and this occurred about four years ago we had a customer come in slightly upset someone had broken into his car and stolen only a few checks from his checkbook and had immediately gone on a spending spree at nearby grocery stores the kind where they use your check to pull the funds out immediately identical to a debit card our manager immediately refunded the lost money and put a warning on his account telling us not to cash any check numbered from to the numbers of the stolen checks he was assured that any more money he lost would be refunded he didnt want to close the account which is what i would have recommended because it takes a while to get new checks and cards and he didnt want to go through all the trouble not days later we have whats called a noncustomer walk in meaning they dont have an account at that bank but still have transactions to run most often cashing checks im currently covering for several coworkers lunches so im the only teller covering the lobby he walks up to me hands me a check and his id and tells me he wants to cash it alright cool let me just check thwhoa wait a minute this is a check that was stolen from that customer a few days ago i doubled and triple checked my suspicions and i was rewarded with numerous red flags the check number was within the stolen range to the signature was clearly forged and was easily the most damning evidence the amount of the check was for an absurdly high amount based on the babysitting job description scrawled down in the memo line the check was for we the tellers had been instructed to call the police in the event that anyone ever came in an presented a forged check and also had strong reason to believe that the person in front of us had done the forging the dude in front of me was covered from head to toe with tattoos smelled like an ashtray dressed in the dirtiest clothes you can imagine and had the words fuck off tattooed on his right forearm in very large very easytoread letters in other words i was calling bullshit on him cashing a check based on his babysitting work so i needed to call the police but how there was no way this guy would stick around the second i picked up the phone and accused him of stealing a check not to mention the fact that this guy actually looked fairly dangerous normal protocol said that i need a manager to verify the check at which point i would go to the back room and call the copsand stay back there leaving the customer at the counter getting frustrated and suspicious so i improvised i started angrily hitting the spacebar on my keyboard and muttered loud enough for the thief to hear me come on not again when he looked inquiringly at me i scowled and said sorry my system just froze up weve been having trouble with this stupid thing all day let me see if i can get someone else to do it i gave a forchristssakejustgowithit look at my only other coworker who fortunately picked up on what i was doing immediately and complained that sure enough her system went down too i looked back up at the thief and apologized in a halflaugh halfscowl that his wait would be a few minutes because our entire network had just gone down he totally bought it even going so far as to say something like damn computers they never work when you need them too hahaha i agreed and told him id go back in the back room to get his cash ready if nothing else i called the police explained the situation to them and they assured me a cop was on his way to our location fast i hung up and called our corporate office and let them know what was happening and they assured me that i was doing the right thing and that they were sending the bank lawyer to our location asap and to be safe i then called our branch manager who was on lunch at this time and then the customer and let them both know what was going on and that wed keep them updated once i was done with this stuffi walked back out to the counter and walked right back up to the thief apologized again for his wait assuring him that we had our it department working nonstop on the situation and would he like a free soda to compensate for the wait he like that so i went and got him one minutes later and i was sweating bullets at this point my body was swimming in adrenaline the cop walked in directly behind the thief who was completely unaware of the whole situation i made eye contact with the cop nodded and then nodded again towards the thief long story short the thief turned around and completely went limp at the sight of cop he admitted to stealing the checks almost instantly and was promptly placed into handcuffs right there in our lobby our bank lawyer who was on the phone with the customer whod had his checks stolen and branch manager walked in a few minutes later after that after the thief was hauled off i was told i had done well by upper management the best part saying that our system was down became the companywide goto excuse whenever tellers needed to stall for time in order to call the police justiiiiiiiiiiiice 
one night i am working the returns desk at my bigbox hardware job when i see this girl barrelling my way pushing a flatbed with five gallon buckets of paint at this exact moment i get a call from paint spoon you see that girl coming to the desk right now i literally watched her and her buddy load those on the cart in paint lp and management is tracking her friend right now stall awesome this is my first red flag to a fraud return let the games begin so of course when she reaches the desk she has no receipt and driver license in hand oh your dad is a contractor and misguessed how much white paint he needed he paid in cash but doesnt mind gift card right that is a totally legit excuse i hear all the time red flag number two of course when i scan them the amount comes out to over the limit a manager is needed to approve so i go ahead and page for one she totally starts sweating bullets she asks if i can break down the transactions so i dont need the approval but still put them on the same gift card ahthere it is red flag number three youve done this enough times to know how the system works bravo nope i cannot knowingly process a transaction like that to avoid manager approval dont worry though as soon as my manager is done with your friend he will come up here to deal with you touchdown she pales and flees the store her buddy realizes his ride is gone only when he tries to outrun lp into the parking lot with his loot police come shortly after but wait you left so fast that you left your id with all your info at the desk i was nice enough to give it to the cops so they could return it to you personally i dont want you to walk away from our little game emptyhanded have a lovely evening
a previous job of mine was cashier and occasional stock boy at a party supply store i especially loathed the register on saturday mornings when moms rushed the store in throngs to obtain bundles of filled balloons for their precious flowers birthdays the first incident took place on a weekday evening when most balloon orders seem to be placed a mom who had separated from her gaggle of other ladies and children walked up to the balloon counter nobody was there so i walked over to help her can i help you i asked in my nicest customer service voice i need some of those um silvery balloons she replied ah the mylar balloons do you have a pattern in mind she examined the wall of flat balloons to find one that she thought fit the theme of her sons party her first choice was sorry maam it seems to be sold out she chose another sorry maam that one is also sold out in a snarky tone im asked do you have any balloons she looks at my name tag get or are you just yankin my chain i assure you we have balloons you need to pick one that doesnt have a sold out sticker on it she replied with a sigh of exasperation and finally chose one we have in stock i filled out the order form and that was that upon returning to my register the display directly across from me containing superherothemed party plates cups utensils etc was in complete disarray the racks had been pulled down cups and themed candy were all over the floor loose ones that didnt come in bulk bags and toys were misplaced that balloon ladys kid about twelve or thirteen years old standing quite close with an item from the display in his hand had simply destroyed the display id have to stay overtime to fix it up i asked the child if he planned on cleaning it up but he replied with a snooty its your job im not doing it his mom eventually comes up and i let her know what her kid did to which she replied you know kids right teehee its not too difficult to clean up right son of afine whatever like mother like kid right a few days pass and im back at my register this being a saturday morning before opening i had two things to do help blow up balloons and curl ribbons and clean the windows and sweep the floors after helping with the balloons i went up to the windows and removed the signs from in front of and off of the doors and windows to clean them i had just finished with the doors and moved onto the windows when the customers began to arrive the minute the store opened many moms with their demonic spawn in tow entered the store and balloon lady and snooty child were amongst them she walks over to the counter to get her balloon bundle and her kid is left to his own devices thats when i hear the loudest bang of my life i turned to see the kid falling backward onto the ground no response from mom he touches his forehead and to his dismay a minor amount of blood is found the kid had run straight into the window beside the door you push open now his mom was super concerned about her child and what he had been doing she is helping him up and asks me in a commanding way what happened i received a warning for my remark but it was worth it dunno thats your job edit grammar tldr my supreme window cleaning skills completely wrecked some kid
so heres my contribution to the world of crazy that is retail preemptive tldr me to the jury in federal court yes it was the man in the light blue suit sitting over there when i was in high school over years ago now i worked at a copyship place i worked there for years and had a lot of fun i got very good at shipping fragile items with the ultimate being a roughly xx gingerbread house it arrived with only a gum drop tree that fell over they faxed us a picture because they were astonished it arrived in one piece but thats not what this story is about one day an older gentleman came into our store he needed to overnight a set of keys that his daughter left when she was in town not an uncommon request just a simple set of keys with the cars keyless remote we package up the keys the gentleman decides that he wants to put them keys in a small padded envelope before putting them in the tyvex fedex envelope i slap on the label and the man pays and leaves i offered all the normal insurance options but he decided the standard was enough as they could just get keys remade pretty uneventful transaction but i specifically remembered him putting the keys in the padded envelope and then into the tyvex envelope to keep them safe as he was worried that the cardboard envelopes could get torn open with the thicker package inside the keys are then off to california a few days later the man returns and needs to file a claim the package had not yet arrived i had been working in this store for roughly years at this point and we had never had a package that wasnt eventually found by the various carriers so called fedex to get a trace started on the package and informed the man that we would likely get a call back in hours and we would call him as soon as we heard something the next day i get a call from fedex that the tyvek envelope was found but the contents were missing this is literally the only package that i sent in years of sending stuff with fedex and ups that actually went missing i called the gentleman and had him come back in to start the claim process to get his money to get the keys remade this is where the fun begins when the man returns he fills out the insurance claim paperwork and lists the contents as keys car remote diamond earrings cash in seeing this i confront the man and let him know that since he didnt list the earrings on the original shipping info it wouldnt be covered and that cash is also not covered and since he only accepted the basic insurance he would not be getting anything over that got the standard but this is what was actually in it response even though i know fullwell he is lying oddly enough this was the last time i saw the old man until a few months later the story starts to get some subplots at this point so take an adventure with me to my junior year prom i took an awesome friend from a regional youth drug and alcohol preventionadvocacy group that i was part of she lived about an hour away from me and after dropping her off at home after prom i know i was a good kid it sucked i was heading down the highway tired as heck at am exits from my dads house where i was going to crash when i forgot the speed limit changed and i got my first and still only speeding ticket of my life a week or so later i was back at work a scruffy looking guy comes in most people would look at him and think this guy has to be on drugs or in a gang or at the minimum drive a motorcycle which is perfect because he was one of our regular customers and was a county drug task force sergeant and frequently made color copies of his crime scenes photos various cases sergeant knew everyone who worked in the store and after waiting until he was the only person in the store pulled out a picture and asked if anyone recognized the man my manager recognized old man from earlier and sent sergeant my way sure enough it was old mans mug shot i fill sergeant in on the transaction and follow up and say i havent seen him in a few weeks well thats because hes in federal custody sergeant asks me a few more questions about what was sent in the lost package and if we had done other business with him which we couldnt recall doing and left it at that a few days later i get a call from sergeant at home and he has a few more questions for me and asks if i can come up to work real quick being the good citizen i am i obliged and was at work a few minutes later instead of asking questions sergeant hands me a summons to testify in federal court whhhaaaaaa he asks if i have any events coming up in the next few weeks that would take me out of town the only thing on my schedule was our annual state youth drug and alcohol prevention conference that prom date and a few others from our local group were going to attend sergeant says he or the prosecutor will be touch with specifics on when i would be needed to testify and that he would try and work around that conference a few more days later and i get notified that the prosecutor had moved the schedule of witnesses around so i would be the first person on the stand in the trial that coming friday and i would be free to leave for the conference after that so basically i get to testify in federal court miss the groups transportation to the conference which was several hours away and likely miss the opening speaker of the conference which just happened to be prosecutors boss the us district attorney the day of the trial comes and im at the federal court house in the large city near where i live im getting a little pretrial prep from sergeant going over the questions they will ask when he pulls out a standard fedex box full of meth he had apparently been trying to use fedex drop boxes to send drugs around the country which was intercepted by a drug dog in a warehouse and the keys which were legitimately lost were to a car full of drugs in california that was part of some drug deal he was trying to do so here i am years old getting sworn in to testify in a federal drug trafficking case the day im supposed to be at a youth drug and alcohol prevention conference with the keynote speaker being the district attorney that was overseeing the case the first question on some date a now decades ago a man sent a set of keys with you while working at copyship place do you see that man today yes it was the man in the light blue suit sitting over there the rest of the testimony went on he asked what was sent what happened to the package etc it took about minutes the defense didnt even ask me any questions and i was free to go as we leave the court room sergeant follows us out and thanks me for helping and he hopes i get to the conference on time he ends with if theres anything i can do for you let me know i think for a second cant hurt to try ive got this speeding ticket a few weeks ago sergeant chuckles and says he will see what he can do i head off to the conference where i make it just in time to hear the opening speaker hes giving us some fluff speech about how kids make all the difference blah blah blah and then its time for questions up i jump mr district attorney i had the honor of testifying in one of your cases earlier this morning is it a growing trend for drug dealers to try and send drugs via the various shipping services mr district attorney chuckled and replied oh i heard about you thanks for your help on that glad you could make it down here on time blah blah blah drugs are bad blah blah blah law enforcement you may think this is where the story ends but now comes two somewhat are you kidding me moments a couple of days after the conference when i was due to either pay the speeding ticket or appear in court i got a call from sergeant he said to head to court and it should be taken care of so i do they call my name and the judge asks how do i plea to the charge of speeding when the traffic court prosecutor speaks up excuse me your honor this is the case that sergeant has been consulting on judge looks at me spouts off a bunch of legal stuff faulty equipment court costs gavel slam the look on the officers face that gave me the ticket was pretty awesome a mix of wtf just happened and who the heck is this kid i paid like bucks and nothing on the record it turns out that old man was convicted and sentenced to something like years in jail the last piece of this story happends a month or so later im back at work enjoying the end of summer and waiting for the start of my senior year when a lady walks in and needs to send a fax i help her with a smile and when i look at the cover page for the fax number i see to federal court of metro city name re people vs old man notice of appeal signed blank as im about to send the fax she asks me to stop and let her check something i then witness her sign old mans name im thinking are you kidding me does she not know who i am that was the last i heard of old man nothing came of the forged signature i assume hes still sitting in federal jail somewhere or maybe got out on good behavior he seemed like a nice guy edits cleaned up spelling from when i typed this in word pad corrected attorney general to district attorney

i work as an assistant manager for a local chain of gas stations the one im at is probably one of the busiest stores in the state from february to september and the only one with two restrooms with multiple stalls instead of just a single unisex one not to mention we are pretty far from the nearest large city so no local police i just got done inspecting our gas pumps and was sitting in the office busy calling in for maintenance a pump hose that started developing some nasty cracks normal uninteresting gas station fair in walks one of our cashiers my back turned to her and she says excuse me i just found this in the womens restroom i turn around and she is holding a loaded handgun she hands it to me and i tell her to let me know if the owner comes back i lock up the office engage the safety yay the safety was off unload the handgun put it in one drawer then the magazine and the round that was in the chamber into another drawer away from the first one i call the state troopers give them all the info thank god it wasnt stolen and they say they will be by soon trooper comes along picks up the handgun gets my info and leaves about minutes later i get a call from another trooper saying that they just pulled over a lady who was speeding on the way towards my store and let me know she is on the way to pick up her handgun she arrives and gets extremely pissed off when i tell her that the troopers already collected it i give her their contact info and she leaves as a responsible firearm owner myself the fact that she just left it laying around in the restroom pisses me off ignoring the fact it had a round in the chamber and the safety was off i am just incredibly happy that an employee went in after her and not a child or thief 
where i work there really needs to be a sign up telling people what is and isnt our job i was working in a large fast food restaurant and it was a pretty slow day i was on drive thru handing out the food being a slow day i walked up to the front to hang around the new girl i wont lie shes slow and i dont like her very much but if i work with people i try be as polite as can be a woman with a baby walks in lays her baby on a table and beacons one of us to come over can you just change him while i find my car keys i tell her were not allowed to leave our positions i am the customer you do as i say i try to explain that we really cant do that well im going to tell the manager and she starts cleaning him up on the table im still explaining that there is a toilet to do that i dont have to listen to you toilets are dirty and humiliating why would i change him in there unfortunately for us the baby had taken a poop with the consistency of curry and his darling mother managed to get it on the table and it didnt smell fantastic when she was finally done she looked the new girl in the eye and grinned im not getting anything because you were so rude and ill be telling your manager how you refused to serve a new mother when she asked for your assistance im not paid to clean children please dont expect it of me also she did call and my wet blanket of a manager apologised and offered her a free meal 
 so this just happened a few days ago i apologize for the wall of text but its warranted for the story i manage a shipping store that loves the color brown we have employees and we do the typical packaging and shipping that you would expect along with copies printing etc as an additional source of revenue we have private contracts to do fingerprinting for two different agencies that run background screenings people in certain lines of work in our state medical child care education etc are required by law to have these background screenings done before starting a new job and after every years of employment people are registered with one of these two agencies make payment to them and are then sent to us with a registration number form to have their fingerprints collected we collect the fingerprints digitally on equipment provided to us by the agencies and they are then electronically submitted to the background check agencies who in turn send them to the fbi and our state law enforcement agency for processing we then sign off on their registration number form and tell them to hold onto it in case there are any problems i should also mention that these screenings are quite expensive to register for but we are only paid a small commission by the agencies for each person we fingerprint we are also the only place in the area to have this done for these agencies no we do a lot of fingerprinting here easily people a day between the two agencies and it can get quite the disruptive to handling of other business in the store when youve only got people working we have lots of strict guidelines that we are required to abide by for fingerprinting so before we start we simply give folks a rundown of what we are going to do and what we need them to do to get them finished as quickly as possible most people cooperate some do not some are just downright rude about it if someone isnt cooperating with what we need them to do keeping relaxed not trying to roll their fingers themselves etc we will ask them again a few times to cooperate if they are rude about it or still dont cooperate then we just do what we need to do to get them finished and out the door if youre fingerprints are deteriorated or damaged or if you were just uncooperative and didnt allow us to get clear prints the prints can be rejected by the fbi or state law enforcement agency as unreadable if this happens they send you a rejection number and then you have to come back with that and your original registration number and get them done all over again this is where our story begins i am at the counter helping customers when this woman walks in you know those people who you can just look at and instantly tell that they are going to have a bad attitude this was one of them so well just cal her bad attitude ba me hello how are you today ba here thrusts random paper at me me take paper see scribbled number on paper okay lets see what weve got here ah it looks like you need to be fingerprinted again ba in extremely condescending tone uh yeah me okay do you have your original registration id ba sigh condescending tone no why dont you just look it up me im sorry but i dont have any way to do that i dont have access to the agencies systems to search for your information we simply enter your registration number to pull up your appointment ba whatever i dont care just

of other customers i apologize to them for her language one of my associates m begins telling me that he was the one that fingerprinted her originally he tells me that she was very uncooperative and was just as rude when he had dealt with her i then tell m and my other associate d that if she comes back in to let me handle it i plan on refusing her service and asking her not to return to the store i am just finishing up with a customer when m motions toward the door ba is coming back in and shes talking to someone on the phone she walks up to the counter and thrusts her phone at me i know whats going on here bad move lady ba here talk to them starts muttering about how stupid we are me hello this is jetblacklungs im the store manager phone hello this is derpina im the hr director for blabiddy blah health care center i understand that theres a problem with bas fingerprinting what information did you need me well we needed to have her registration id to collect her finger prints again but at this point im not going to be able to complete this for her phone what is the issue ba is standing directly across the counter from me with a slightly puzzled look on her face i look her dead in the eyes as i continue speaking me when she came in earlier and i asked her for the information i needed she became very rude and combative telling me that my request was effing ridiculous and that we shouldve done our effing jobs before calling me an ahole from across the store on her way out this was all done in front of several customers in my store we do not tolerate this kind of behavior and i will not allow her back into this store a look of horror and plain old oh sht flashes across bas face ba well you started it i give her a look that just says bitch please phone oh my

so theres pretty strict laws about liquor store operations where i am the one in question here was the fact that a liquor store has to sell liquor in sealed containers ie you cant open an adhoc pub and customers are not allowed to open or consume liquor on premises i ran a bottleshop this was a small country town and the two bottleshops would help each other out and keep each other in the loop about problem customers etc one day i got a call from the other shop about a group of tourists who got all offensive when they were told they couldnt open or consume on premises citing their right to have their own liquor etc they stormed out without taking their goods they came into my store being nice i said i would give them their products that they paid for at the other shop and sort out the stock transfer with them later as long as they didnt open or consume it on premises they were pissed that i knew that they had left stuff behind and what have you but went and grabbed their stuff one of them on the way out stopped at the door turned to me opened a can took a sip being quite the rebel and walked out queue the cop a local that was walking into the store he saw a little bit came in and asked what was up i explained it to him he excused himself and left the store minutes later i hear screaming from the carpark the police officer had given a ticket to the guys for a bunch of things but the big one was effectively driving while drinking just pulling out of carpark the guys stormed off on foot brilliant i thought perfect timing from the local cop had a smile on my face the rest of the day rang the other shop and we were cracking up laughing i leave at the end of my shift and the cop is sitting there next to the car i went over to say thanks and the cop tells me in what i think was the most brilliant move ever that he rang the rental company who instantly terminated the rental agreement and were sending someone to pick up the vehicle apparently it stuffed their whole six week itinerary there wasnt anywhere to rent a vehicle for close to a days solid driving 
customer comes in asking help for a certain problem my conversation yesterday went like this lady l me me obviously lady my grill is not working do you know whats wrong after looking at it i noticed the ignition was broken off so she couldnt ignite it me yes maam the igniter is broken and needs to be replaced we sell universal ones for cheap lady of no thats not right my friend told me i just needed some more propane me why did you bring the entire grill in here if you just needed propane lady can you help me or not or do you now know anything about grills i just sold her a new propane tank and helped her load the grill back in her truck she will be back and blame me tomorrow probably about selling her the wrong thing this happens all the time people ask for help i give them an answer and than they just ignore my answer and insult me that i dont know anything 
original story so im an impatient bastard so i decided to not wait for a reply to my email to corporate and instead called their corporate hotline i was connected to the district manager for arizona and i told my tale of woe to her when i was done she admitted that while it was legal to accept state ids dm however it is against our store policy to accept them for alcohol purchases me can you explain why dm there are so many different state ids out there that its impossible to train our employees on what they look like so we keep it simple and just dont accept any me but you accept out of state drivers licenses dm oh yes we accept those me wouldnt your argument about the number of different state ids also apply to drivers licenses how can you deny state ids for that reason but accept drivers licenses dm its just our policy thats when i decided to bring up an issue that people had mentioned in the original thread me arent you worried about violating the americans with disabilities act dm how so me well lots of disabled people dont drive and have state ids instead is it your grocery stores official policy that disabled people arent allowed to buy alcohol there dm umcan i call you back so she calls back minutes later and surprise it turns out that she was mistaken and that state ids can in fact be used to buy alcohol at their stores she promises to personally call the general manager of the store i went to and make sure that he retrains his employees on alcohol sales protocol she also promised to find out what manager was working that shift and make sure they get a talking to about the proper way to deal with a guest who has an issue all in all im satisfied and kind of amused by this whole situation i didnt want people fired i just wanted their obviously incorrect actions corrected though being a petty bastard every time i go into that location to buy booze in the future im going to look for that particular manager and if shes there ask her if she can ring up my pack of beer for me 
when i was in college i was the night manager at a fast food place near campus that stayed open until am after we closed we had a half hour to clean the store and leave my boss said if we could not get the store cleaned in that halfhour i could do one of two things i could have everyone clock out and finish cleaning the store or i could call him and explain why we couldnt get the store clean in a half hour and maybe just maybe he would let us all stay clocked in to finish the minute he told me this i thought to myself this is bs one night we got a rush at am apparently there had been a frat party and at least people poured into the lobby to order tacos it was just me and one other person on duty because that weeknight was usually very slow we managed to clear everyone out by am we did worth of cent tacos in that minutes after everyone was gone i looked around and realized we were past our deadline for clocking out now im not going to even ask someone to clock out and work for free its not in my nature soi called my boss yep i woke him up after he screamed at me for not calling him when the rush started so he could come and help he lived minutes away he yelled at me some more i simply asked him if he wanted us to stay clocked in and clean the store or if he wanted us to clock out and go home he chose the former edit for those of you fond of math the cent taco was an example of how cheap the food was people ordered drinks and other food items too mostly burritos but also enchiritos
i work in a neighborhood childrens store we sell toys and books and most of our customers are grandparents people buying birthday gifts or both yesterday a grandpa came in to shop for his grandson grandpa i need something for my year old grandson me great are you looking for a toy maybe something to build or we could do a book does he still like picture books grandpa a book would be nice he likes to read so i suggest a few books to him and we finally settle on the wonderful and hilarious this moose belongs to you should all read it me would you like this giftwrapped today is this a birthday present or a just because gift at this the grandpa paused normally this is a pretty easy question but i could tell he was trying to figure out what to say i try not to pry about what people are buying but i did want to know what kind of paper to use grandpa well its kind of a long story i ring him up and start wrapping the book and then he explains why hes buying the gift grandpa my grandson has a favorite stuffed dog he takes everywhere a few months ago he asked his mother when dog was born she picked a date out of the air and thought nothing of it a week ago he piped up and said mom dogs birthday is coming up march me starting to laugh this is a gift for his stuffed dog grandpa yup were having a birthday party tomorrow with pizza and ice cream and everything and i figured you cant have a birthday party without a gift and a book is a nice gift he can read it to dog i finished up wrapping and sent him on his way i have to say after years working here this was the first time ive ever wrapped a gift for a stuffed animal i found the whole thing absolutely charming i hope you did too happy birthday dog edit i did not expect this story to get so popular thank you everyone for your kind comments while ive had plenty of experiences with bad customers its moments like these that make me happy to be a bookseller 
hello i apologize in advance for formatting grammatical and spelling errors im on my phone so im in my early s and work part time retail at a beauty supply store to supplement my disability income i just went through a month long battle with a very aggressive form of leukemia which for any who arent familiar with it is a blood cancer in including daily infusions of arsenic and chemotherapy and even though there isnt a cure it can be controlled with oral chemos now that im past the first year but i will be weakened and immune compromised for many years if not the rest of my life and will probably have to be on these medicines for the rest of my life as well earlier today i had a lady come in and just by the look of her and how she acted you could tell she was going to be self entitled and some what rude at best she was overly tan with bleach blonde hair super long bright pink acrylics channel bag and drove a mercedes she goes directly for our selection of hair extensions and browses for a few minutes she was talking loudly on her cellphone the whole time and didnt even acknowledge my greeting as she entered the store she then starts snapping her fingers at me to get my attention snapping her fingers like im a dog i guess she couldnt be bothered to tear herself away from her riveting conversation about why her friends coworkers boyfriend was having lunch with another woman to speak to me like a human i walk over to her and politely ask what she needs help with she wants me to unlock all of our hair so she can browse as she liked we keep it locked because a lot of it is over and is a high theft item i told her i wasnt allowed to do that but if there was any color that she wanted to look at i would be happy to unlock it for her and we also have a ring of full length swatches she is welcome to look at she starts huffing and giving me dirty looks how dare i tell her no as per our company policy dont i know who her husband is eventually she settles on one of our priciest sets of human hair clip ins before i ring her up i let her know that all of our hair is absolutely not returnable or exchangable for any reason once she walks out the door she says fine and i ring her up and tell her the final price plus tax close to she goes ballistic but my daughter may have cancer so i should get a discount so your buying extensions for your daughter because she may have cancer no theyre for me but its very stressful having a sick child and the cancer will be very expensive to treat if she has it wot maam im very aware of how expensive cancer is but we dont offer illness discounts if you had ever had a loved one with cancer youd understand im a really easy going person and usually let things like this not effect me in the slightest hell i love making cancer jokes but i hate it when people use other peoples illnesses to gain sympathy and benefit my mother had a really tough time dealing with my illness so i l know how truely heartbreaking it can be to have a sick child i have cancer maam so i know what its like and how devastating this type of illness can be on the body and mind all four of my grand parents died of cancer and my step mother is battling breast cancer for the rd time and it has metastasized to her lungs lymph nodes and brain and theyre giving her less than years so yes i know how it feels if i were to give a cancer discount it would be to the people fighting it not people trying to gain my sympathies silence and stunned look from her your total is would you like a bag she was very sweet for the minutes it took her to pay and leave tldr my kid might have cancer so discounts on items to make myself look good through my grieving period maybe
i worked at a few grocery stores and convenient stores during and right after high school i was never cut out for these jobs i get extremely upset with myself if i let someone walk all over me and i dont retaliate i replay the incident over and over in my head and obsess over it so i would retaliate often and get myself into trouble i remember this one time when a redneck walks into the convenient store tosses a wadded dollar bill onto the counter and barks at me marlboro reds oh boy here we go i was about to be a jerk back and rednecks are usually ready for a fight i took the twenty and began slowly unwadding it while staring directly into rednecks beady little eyes with a straight face once i had the bill unfolded i placed it neatly into the till and gathered up his change however before handing it back to him i wadded up the bills and then dropped the wad and the change onto the counter my adrenaline was kicking in full force in anticipation of the confrontation that was imminent to rednecks credit he proved me wrong he just chuckled and said i see what you did there then scooped up his changed and stuffed it into his pocket i wished him a nice day and he thanked me sometimes people just arent thinking and genuinely dont intend to be rude i dont mind this as long as they are reasonable human beings who recognize and acknowledge their rudeness after it is pointed out to them
so this didnt actually happen to me but to a coworker i work for an attraction in a tourist town that hires high schoolers for summer jobs a couple of days ago we had a group of elderly men and women come in to play our miniature golf course now this day we had one of the high schoolers running the register we shall call her mouse because shes normally very quiet at least when dealing with customers the first old man walks up to the counter and very quickly says one for minigolf mouse says okay sir that will be old man replies with what about the senior discount now we dont have a senior discount but if youre nice we will normally give the local discount percent off mouse says im sorry sir we dont have a senior discount but i can at this point the old man loudly interrupts with well what kind of s is that dont you support seniors now you should understand that our demographic is families with young children so there are kids everywhere he stares at mouse with a smirk on his face what followed surprised me mouse looked him straight in the eye thank god for the elevated cash wrap because shes like five feet tall and otherwise would have had to crane her neck to do it and says that will be he starts in again she interrupts with that will be every time he opens his mouth she just says that will be the look of utter defeat as he handed his money over was very satisfying tldr old man tries to intimidate a year old girl by yelling and cursing at her year old girl dont give a fuck old man puts tail between legs
the operations manager was on vacation this past week and no one picked up her slack cue her return on sunday and the safe empty of anything smaller than a cant go to the back so we had to be creative its against policy but i ran out of fucks to give ages ago and made a hand written sign that said we need ones please thank you and posted it on the side of my register most anyone who puts their stuff down would be able to see it some donated their excess garage sale cash while others ignored it and insisted on paying exact coin change so theyll get an extra dollar back it all balanced out in the end so who cares a young family comes up daughter in the cart dad at the pinpad and mom unloading the groceries the daughter is a small kid i cant judge ages very well but maybe or so she looks up at me and says gtkid why do you need ones gtme because we ran out im kind of awkward around kids ive had too many parents get upset with talking to their child in the past so i always keep it short and sweet without being fluffy or condescending i keep ringing up their order and notice a strange tension between the parents all of a sudden i start to worry that i may have phrased my answer inappropriately somehow and ring faster to make up for whatever infraction i might have caused the mom suddenly stops and looks at her daughter gtmom you can read the dad stops too and looks back and i stop ringing so he wont have to worry about price watching gtmom she just read that sign and asked her about it its not even the number one its spelled out gtdad you can read whats this word gtkid we keeps pronouncing it wrong but how kids say words wrong sometimes the dad gives up and goes back to looking at the screen while the mom insists that shes saying we it was just such an adorable moment and the girl looked so bashful with all the attention she was getting she had this expression kind of like yeah of course i can read duh while her mom and dad were each giddy and ecstatic it just made my day to see a happy family celebrate a milestone i had to share

lyranotsureim not a huge fan of coupons in general there is usually some problem with them like they are either expired they dont scan or some issue in the fine print that will either make the customer go into a yelling fit or make the line pile up which is a pet peeve of mine if you want to use one or two coupons i am fine with that i completely understand wanting to save some money but there is a trend that pisses me off to no end couponers a lady came in a while back with a large amount of deodorant in her basket after i finished ringing her up she said oh and i have a few coupons she then pulled a massive wad of coupons out of her purse none of them having scannable bar codes meaning that they would all have to be keyed in manually i called up a second cashier and began to read the fine print as i am supposed to she notices i am reading them and says yeah those should pay for the entire transaction im sorry it says limit one coupon per customer and that they arent to be used with any other coupons i reply no i did the math i have enough here to cover the entire transaction in fact you guys should technically be giving me cash back she says with a chuckle at this point the line was piling up again on my register so i called up a third cashier and the manager the manager comes up and asks how he can help she says yeah this guy wont let me use my coupons i point out to him that it clearly states that the coupons cant be used like this the manager ignores me and lets her have the fifteen or so deodorants for free before she left you could just feel the smugness radiating off of her she says you should be expecting more of us we couponers are starting to get pretty big around here next time just scan the damn coupons she then struts out the door with a smile the manager was fired soon after 
had this type of customer come in yesterday i work at a hardware store where we sell wood obviously we keep wood on the floor for customers to buy and than the overstock stacked behind it in pretty high stacks bundled together sometimes we get very annoying difficult customers who think the stack of peices of wood on the floor are not good enough and want us to cut the wood in the back we cannot do this for a multitude of reasons but the main is safety here is the conversation that followed me me ag angry guy me sorry sir we cant cut that bundle because the lumber will fall and it becomes a safety issue also we have no place to put it once we open it since it cant go back up ag i dont care all of the wood down here is bad me have you looked through it i dont think you could have looked through all of that in five minutes ag i dont care i want that wood points at bundles in the back if you arent gonna do it i can get the manager to make you do it for me at this point i walked away and went to talk to my manager about the proper procedure he told me to go back and explain to him exactly what i said before when i came back however he was climbing on top of the wood cutting the bundle himself keep in mind this is about feet high we had to ban him from the store for safety concerns over customers safety some people just like being difficult

i work at a grocery store near philadelphia for those of you unaware it snowed here recently a lot the parking lot is mostly plowed but the cart corrals are still filled up with snow so a lot of people have been just leaving their carts outside the corrals waiting to get hit by a car so im doing carts last night and some lady comes up to the other end of the corral im at and asks is it okay if i just leave this here while starting to put her cart next to the corral normally i wouldnt tell a customer that id prefer them to put their cart back inside but since she asked i assumed she actually cared where i wanted her to put it i say actually can you put it back in the store gt lady youre kidding right gt me no the corrals are filled in with snow carts slide around cars get damaged its just a big mess gt lady so you want it back in the store gt me yeah gt lady thats crazy and she walks away with her cart in a huff i see her go up to another customer and yell he wants us to put the carts back in the store can you believe that as im bringing in a line of carts i pass her coming out the entrance i see that after all that she did put her cart away so i say thanks and she just looks away with a scowl on her face sorry lady being asked to clean up after yourself like an adult can be tough i guess
background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of july and new years eve story welcome to the week of scam artists they rarely get away with it but that sure doesnt stop them from trying everything we sell is buy get free bogo we also send out mailers and have business cards that are good for buy get free on any item up to we also let you mix and match the items so you dont have to get three of the same things im basically giving you an extra in free fireworks just for showing up in the hopes that you purchase more than that and that you come back to see us every year the coupons have your typical legalese at the bottom can only be used on one item cannot be reproduced one offer per day one offer per family our group only valid on items up to etc i usually keep a stack of these coupons in my pocket and i hand them out pretty freely when the store is open i think its a great promotional tool and although it does impact my bottom line i wouldnt think of getting rid of it as you can imagine we get our fair share of people trying to scam us with the coupon scam theres a lady and her husband that show up at our tent at least four or five times each season with coupons each time its the same routine theyll spend an hour watching videos and carefully examining everything we sell when theyre ready to checkout the husband and wife will both approach the counter separately each carrying their three items and each with and a coupon they each pay for one item and get the other two for free if we ask them if there together which ive done before for laughs they shake their heads and act like theyve never met even though they just spent the last hour shopping together the very next day theyll show up and do the exact same thing another hour of examining products pick out three walk to the counter separately use their coupon even though they are technically scamming me i always let it go because frankly i think its funny as hell scam another regular customer every season this guy comes in and picks out three of every item he intendeds to purchase when he gets to the counter he presents his coupon and we of course explained to him that he can only use it on one item hell then spend minutes arguing that i let him use it on everything he purchased the last time he was here in the end ill let him use it on two items and he celebrates like hes won the lottery the thing is hes a regular and he buys a shitload of fireworks id probably give him a better discount than the two uses of the card if we didnt have to go back and put up all the extra shit he picked out i seriously think he does it just to feel like hes gotten something over on us scam a lady walks up to the counter with a fountain and two massive assortments in her cart i was standing behind the counter so i went to ring her up before i could start she handed me a coupon and this conversation took place lady im just paying for the fountain im going to use the coupon for the free items me wondering wtf she is thinking im sorry but the coupon is only good on items up to and the free items have to be of equal or lesser value lady it doesnt say that anywhere on the coupon i look at the coupon and sure as hell shes rightbecause shes cut off the bottom third of the coupon that had all the legalese me im sorry but this coupon has been altered it normally has all the details on the bottom handing her another coupon from my pocket so she can see lady thats not my problem my coupon doesnt say that so legally you have to honor my purchase me rudely because wtf really yeah thats not going to happen i dont know what happened to your coupon sure i dont but its been altered and im not obligated to take altered coupons the lady is now full on yelling at me insisting that im breaking the law and that she can sue me for not taking her coupon on this particular day thank god we actually had hired an off duty uniformed police officer to sit at the entrance to the tent acting as security we do that on our busier days because its a great deterrent for theft and it builds goodwill with the local police since they make great extra money for a really easy gig see besides they love my moms cajun cooking the lady stomps away from the counter and approaches the police officer to obviously raise hell about me before she can say anything the officer looks her in the eyes and says one moment maam the calls over to me loudly enough for everyone to hear officer did you want me to arrest her or just throw her out me its up to you youve got to fill out the paperwork she left without another word if youre interested ive posted a few other stories

ive worked at a major supermarket chain in australia for almost nine years so i have a lot of regular customers who i adore yesterday was my birthday so naturally i was rostered on to work while i was on my tea break one of my favourite regulars chases after me asking me about light globes shes a little old italian lady who always says things like god bless you you are like a granddaughter to me sometimes she can be a bit hard to understand as her english is good but not perfect so we play charades trying to guess what it is that she wants for instance one day she kept drawing a square with her hands in the air while i guessed a box no a baking tray she wanted frozen puff pastry sheets anyway i happily help her with the light globes and mention that its my birthday before i go on my break minutes later when i get back to the kiosk one of my coworkers says that ladys been waiting for you i think she has something for you she waited my whole tea break to give me a box of chocolates she comes up to me covers my cheeks in kisses and wishes me a happy birthday while doing her usual god bless you youre like a granddaughter to me sometimes i really do love customers 
reading some of these stories reminded me of a time i used to work at a fast food restaurant a couple years back i was handing out food at the drive through and a customer ordered an ice cream cone she pulled up to the window and i politely attempted to hand her the ice cream she gave me a disgusted look and said im not having that you just breathed on it let me speak to your manager i happily accepted and went and told my manager what happened he started laughing took the ice cream off me walked out of the view of the customer and returned with the same ice cream and said there you go darling sorry about that heres a fresh one she gave me a wry smile and drove off licking her breathed on ice cream edit my manager was great he once threw a pikey over a small fence when she spat in his face edit a pikey is an irish traveler they tend to steal harass and generally cause a nuisance to the unfortunate areas they choose to call home for the next couple of weeksmonths not all are like this as i have been reassured many times on traveler related tv shows but i have yet to meet a nice one

greetings tfr here is a badly formatted verbal exchange for you all ill set the scene a couple of young girls came to the petrol station yesterday after some cigarettes its not uncommon for young people to come to us since major uk supermarkets use a think policy on tobacco products as a small shop we are perceived as being more lenient anyway they pulled up and a big girl looked about got out i looked away because she started doing star jumps much to her friends amusement but i didnt want to see that sorry i digress the conversation went as follows sjg star jump girl ill be me sjg can i have redacted cigarettes no introductions no please no problem s me yes certainly can i see some id please sjg oh really do i not look me no im afraid not but you should be flattered smile sjg oh fine walks out and talks to her friend her friend looked a little older was wearing a tracksuit and shall be called ts accordingly in she walks ts can i have exact same cigarettes starts removing items from her purse me thinking she was looking for id yes ts well me oh i need to see your id i thought thats what you were getting out ts oh are you serious i drove here me the driving age here is you need to be to buy cigarettes ts oh come on i have kids me well i dont know that do i ts oh i have a tattoo pulls up top to show small tattoo me thats not id it doesnt prove youre how do i know they checked your id ts you have to have id to get a tattoo me and you have to have id to buy cigarettes ts ugh youre just being difficult and back to the car she went flipping the bird honking the horn and driving off into the night it was a good effort but even if she was she was buying for her friend who wasnt anyway it frustrates me when they know theyre in the wrong but act all outraged at me as if im being so unreasonable but as far as im concerned i won side note some people have quite rightly said that i should have point blank have refused the sale due to the obvious reason that ts was buying for sjg a proxy sale i explained somewhere in the tangle of comments below but thought id add it here that i agree but i thought it was easier to argue with a proven lack of id if id said no theyre for your friend she could have potentially argued with me
first time poster been meaning to share this for a while so i used to work in a mom and pop restaurant as a server it was a great job and i was regularly recognized as a great server i loved my job and being good at it gave me a lot of pride i would typically work after school and from ampm saturday saturdays were typically crazy busy a lot of older folks in for the good deals and great food it wasnt uncommon to be completely full for hours in the morning and sometimes wed take tables in other servers sections to help with the load one saturday things were going as normal and i was chugging along it got to be about and lunch was beginning to come out of the kitchen when i noticed something it took a moment to hit exactly what i was looking at there was a table of an older married couple that i recognized but why did i recognize them oh my god they were my table from another servers section a rush of blood went straight to my face this table got here at about what time was it it couldnt be i felt sick i hadnt seen them in at least hours so i go over and the exchange went something like this me i i am so sorry i dont even know what to say it has been a really busy morning and i just lost track of things i cant begin to apologize enough i am so sorry him with about the warmest smile i ever remember seeing he takes his wifes hand and says dont worry about it we enjoy each others company it was the sweetest thing id ever seen i tried comping their meal but he had none of it they paid in full and left me a tip on about a bill to this day it was one of the most forgiving and genuine acts of love id ever seen ill never forget it tldr im an idiot and left a table sitting for damn near hours after i realized the old man assured me that the time spent with his wife wasnt wasted 
i work at a highend movie theater where we serve people in nice comfy seats yesterday was my fourth day working there and a family came in to see maleficent in d the mom calls me over and asks if this movie is in d which i politely answer yes too she complains that she hates d movies and didnt order d i tell her to sit tight and see what i could do for her i grab my manager and explain the situation and he says the family bought tickets online not our fault she ordered the wrong theater but he offered to have her switch to a later showing in d and we would refund the extra money i go back to inform the guest what was decided and she said that since her kids were already comfortable in the seats that they were going to stay in that theater and expect us to switch the movie to a d version i explained to her that it wasnt possible and apologized she states that she will just refuse to wear the d glasses for the movie then
edit she died in her sleep at least she wasnt in pain and didnt suffer i worked again today and was in tears as soon as i saw my other coworkers by now everyone has been told and it really struck hard whats normally a noisy cheerful environment full of laughter was total silence none of us would talk aside from greeting a customer giving total and saying bye to the customer no small talk no laughter no loud noises most of the customers sensed something had happened a lot of people were in the break room taking breathers and being idle grieving in our own bubbles some went home early a lot of workers from other stores were there the mood felt like a real thick heavy fog as soon as you walked in the door end edit we dont know what happened her daughter called this morning i arrived at pm for my shift and noticed her name on the roster was crossed off i thought nothing of it just thought she had a sick day or something come up it was busy very busy for most of my shift it was one customer after the other and i noticed the morale was low i just thought it was because of being down two workers and being really busy i finished my shift thinking all was fine was a busy shift but was glad that it was over as im walking out to my car the duty manager stops me says she needs to talk to me i assumed it was about the drugged man wandering around earlier we called the police and they took him in but maybe since i was there i needed a debriefing and then she told me about my coworker it was like swallowing a brick just a huge weight sinking to the bottom of my stomach someone so healthy full of life always happy and such a good worker gone she wasnt sick she wasnt that old shed only be in her early fifties we were exchanging cute cat videos the last time we were on break together laughing at cats and kittens on youtube im still trying to register that ill never work with her again never see her again or hear her again shes gone so i say to you guys live life to the fullest these jobs may suck and the people may be horrible but enjoy what you can you never know when time is up it doesnt matter how healthy you are you never know rest peacefully angela we love and miss you so much

back to work at the weekend after a short absence when someone hit me with a fridge they were my colleague lets call her rose is with me on the customer service desk making sure that im ok on my first shift back when she spots someone she points him out to me gtrose that guy wearing the puffer coat is a shoplifter hes banned from the town centre so tries his luck out here hes not very successful gtme why gtrose watch him hes on the prowl shoplifter then proceeds to head towards the mobile phone display at the rear of the store these are dummy units made to resemble the actual phone they have a massive bolt through them that slots into a rod on the display and is held down by a cord but our shoplifter is either too high or too stupid to realise this smartphone cash whatever his fix is sidenote our store is fairly large but is laid out so you cant take the smaller items and have a straight run at the exit i know for a fact that there are two uniformed guards around the store both of which at this point are closer to the door than the shoplifter shoplifter makes a show of checking his phone and looking for accessories he picks up a case a charger headset reading the boxes before looking around the security guards are not looking in his direction he grabs the nearest dummy smartphone still not realising that its a dummy and starts to run before now i never realised how much of the cord can unspool before it stops for anyone else curious about this the answer is not much our intrepid thief gets no more than two metres before it stops and like in a cartoon he is jerked backwards and to the floor dazed he stands up and tries again snapping the cord and running off with the dummy phone i honestly dont know what was funnier the drop to the floor the look on his face when the police informed him that he had stolen a dummy phone or the fact that the security staff and the duty manager were really trying hard not to laugh at the guy as he was led away in handcuffs
weirdest tale i have is an elderly customer who used to come in once a week for sherry we used to have a bit of a chat it was a social outing for her for the week i didnt see her for a couple of weeks a letter rocked up to work it turns out she had passed on and left me all her antique furniture and for my family to live in her place until we all die rent free best i can tell she did it to screw over her kids who never paid her attention very awkward position that took some delicate work to get out of and not come across as a scam artist

so heres another story from my adventures at a sandwich shop a while back i was working and a lady came in she looked grumpy so i braced myself for the worst me hi how can i help you today gl i want a ham on wheat so i make it for her and was just about to put it in the toaster when she asks if she can get bacon on there which i happily oblige to so i finish making her sandwich and surprisingly nothing annoying had happened yet so i ring her up and tell her the price when she gets this pissed off look on her face gl hey i thought that was supposed to be me sorry maam bacon costs extra gl ugh if i would have known that i woudnt have gotten it you were supposed to tell me me im sorry maam but all of our prices are listed on the signs directly above me i assumed you were aware that bacon isnt free and had looked at our signs and understood our prices gl that is ridiculous i shouldnt have to look at the signs that bacon should be free and im not paying for it i had enough of her at this point me tell that to the deli at the grocey store and see what they tell you im sorry but bacon has never been free and you will pay for it or youre not getting it gl i want to talk to your manager the best part my manager was up there the whole time he just stared at her turned around and walked away needless to say she paid for her bacon
a few days ago i was in box office at the chain movie theater ive been working my senior year of high school it was in the middle of a big rush and a coworker one of my managers and i were working through the line efficiently some woman yo or so with younger kids got to the front of the very long line and had no idea what movie she wanted to see so she stepped to the side out of the line this is important and told me to take the next few guests a solid minutes later the woman interrupted me while i was with a customer and demanded her tickets given that shed been loitering for that long and the line was down to maybe people i asked that she wait until im done serving the people in line bear in mind with cashiers this would have taken minutes tops she proceeded to flip at least several shits saying something along the lines of how dare you i already waited in line im a paying customer i dont like that trying to maintain calm i told her she could go over to guest services where there was no line and they could help her out very quickly apparently the yard walk wasnt worth it so she just got back in line glaring at me the whole time when she reached the front my coworker was the one who ended up helping her but she decided to interrupt a transactionagainto come and yell at me saying i cant believe some high school dropout can tell me to wait in line again at this point my manager who is also a total bro looked over smiled and said maam that high school dropout youre insulting is actually in the top of his class and is going to one of the best universities in the country this fall wrongly insulting him when hes doing his job correctly wont get you anywhere she stood with her mouth open for a moment glancing between my manager and me we both smiled at her she got her tickets when she got her soda she promptly spilled it and was made to pay for another one by the same manager tldr do you see what you get carla do you see what you get when you mess with the warrior
it never fails weekend nights im herding customers out the door at closing time every time most of them just need a little push not literal though id love it to be sometimes towards the door but some are special little snowflakes who are bygod gonna stay here as long i as want you peon good thing our lighting is controlled by corporate and goes down to pretty much emergency lighting about ten minutes after we close you can see but it is obvious that the store is closed i was making my rounds the other night after having closed the last register when lo and behold what to my wondrous eyes did appear but a special little snowflake sls coming up the up escalator into the mens department i intercepted her at the top landing and asked which exit door she needed to use as they were all locked at this point sls oh no im not leaving i need to look at mens bathing suits me mam the store is closed i can escort you to an exit and unlock it for you sls no show me where the swimsuits are me mam again the store is closed the registers are all shut down we open tomorrow at ten am which exit door would you like to use sls none i demand you show me to the mens bathing suits you are not closing until i wham lights go out sls clearly unnerved why are the lights off me because as i said we are closed now which exit did you need to use sls meekly points in the general direction of an exit i let her out she never says another word 
so our pos system is stupid you cant go back once you hit total so if the price doesnt sound right to the customer you cant go back and tell them the price on everything i had my manager come help me because im still new and i all ready rerang this order once my manager then hits the total button tries to go back then turns to me sailordoctorwho what did you do what do you mean what did i do i cant go back thats because you hit total no i didnt rering this up so for the rd time i rang this customer up and the customer was just so fed up she didnt care about the price and left angrily and apparently my manager thinks i ninja walked behind her pressed total and silently slipped away to my spot feet away without her noticing maybe it was just to spite her im not sure since i didnt actually do that
ive been lurking here since i started my job at a supermarket and finally i have a story i want to share i was working self service on saturday and somehow despite the fact that id only been there half an hour it felt like id received a full days abuse and i already hated every customer in existence there was finally a quiet moment when miraculously i had no customers and a sweet little old man came up and decided to use the self service machine for the first time since there was no queue he told me hed need some extra help and i was happy to especially because he was incredibly entertaining to talk to i actually only had to show him where the scanner was because he carefully read and followed all of the directions on the screen i went a tidied up another machine so he didnt feel like i was hovering and when i came back he had finished his shop and was trying to pay for the shopping by waving his note in front of the scanner i cant get it to work he looked at me in confusion i told him these machine confuse everyone when it comes to paying because all of them are different and showed him the hole the notes go in and he laughed at himself when he realised that of course the machines wouldnt scan anything without a barcode and then he told me hed probably be back in an hour because hell have bought the wrong milk and went off with his shopping bag to his wife
customer just called the store she says she cant get into her account and needs to to pay her bill i kindly tell her i cant go into her account over the phone but if she has another phone to use she can call customer care to pay she yells read my lips i dont have access to my account i said maam were talking on the phone i cant read your lips needless to say she didnt like that
hi guys its been awhile so a customer comes over to my coworkers register midday yesterday with a very disgusting dog bed it was soiled had hair all over it and a hole that was obviously made by said dog the customer starts proclaiming i want a refund i bought this dog bed two weeks ago and it is an absolute disgrace queue coworker getting manager over to speak with dog man dm for short dm can you believe ive had this dog bed for two weeks and my dog chewed a hole in it i would like a refund manager sir we cant refund you because your dog chewed a hole in it dm you arent going to stand behind your products you need to give me a refund manager sir we are an offprice retailer and we dont make our own products its a dog dogs are going to chew holes in things dm my dog doesnt know its a dog it has never done anything like this before it must be the dog bed manager im not going to refund your money dm ok can i just leave it here then my manager was literally trying not to laugh through the entire thing after working in retail for over years i can say that this is the most hilariously bold thing any of my customers has ever done
a few years back i used to work at a medium sized supermarket in the uk we all used to send each other warning emails if ever someone tried a scam at one of our stores even if the store was the other side of the friggin country i remember once getting an email that actually impressed me it was a two man operation and essentially it was a gift card scam theyd load a large trolley full of shopping and make their way to the checkout they would also have a gift card what would happen next is that theyd get the cashier to put on the gift card at the start of the transaction the cashier would then continue to scan each item and then one of the guys would disappear when the cashier had finished scanning everything the dude left behind would suddenly realise hed left his wallet in his car hed then run out to go grab it only hed never come back during this time the guy who did a disappearing act earlier had gone to another checkout with a tv and paid with his now preloaded gift card sometimes the ingenuity of the shifty and dodgy amaze me edit for clarity after this incident our gift card policies were overhauled so that going forward gift cards were processed as the last item in the transaction and werent hadnt over until the transaction was closed and payment taken
ive had a rough week and yesterday at work something happened that cheered me up immensely i work at a teen resale shop a woman came in to shop while her husband obediently followed her carried her clothes and what not eventually she comes to check out and she realized she forgot her purse so being a good husband he goes out to the car to get it on his way back in he sees myself my coworker and his wife all waiting for him at the counter he stops smiles and then throws the bag over his shoulder like a runway model as he catwalked back to the counter swinging his hips side to side and putting a little strut in his step he said in his sassiest voice oh sorry i just forgot my purse might not be as funny on print but we were in a fit of giggles when he walked out the door with his nowembarrassed wife he was still carrying her bags and still catwalking
not sure where else to post this but i really need to get this off my chest i am a gymnastics coach and i generally love my job i work with the upper level girls the ones that go out and compete even though im considered pretty young college age to be coaching teams were a pretty small gym and the parents are for the most part great to work with but there is one ohhhhh there is always that one this mom a woman who takes pride in the fact that she is a childrens therapist and basically a glorified tutor is the most im their friend first and their parent second person i have ever met in my life when it comes to her children she brought her daughter entitled mini witch emw for short to our program just under years ago now emw is talented but because her mother lets her get away with murder she is one of the most lazy rude and miserable children i have ever had to work with i am absolutely heated in a conversation that happened during my lunch break and i just need to get this out of my system before going back for the teams second work out because im still livid im eating at the front desk and sorting through paperwork because its easier for me to just stay there rather than drive all the way back home then all the way back to the gym and there are no classes during the afternoon so my boss is fine with it this mother storms into the gym marches straight up to the desk and says ginger i am absolutely shocked and appalled by what emw told me today but i know kids can exaggerate so i wanted to come talk to you before going to owner awh shoot i know exactly whats coming this girl came to practice minutes late we were almost done with warm up and she was being generally unpleasant but its twoadays and mornings suck so i was trying to be understanding i got nothing but backsass and i cant do event she doesnt like my ankle hurts yet when we got to an event she enjoyed she was magically healed i was having none of it but like the good little peon i am i responded with oh uhm okay what did emw tell you about practice mom she said that you made her condition for the whole practice while everyone else was working out all practice she was in tears by the time she got home because you were so rude to her alright now im kind of agitated but i expected this kind of thing this sounds like a typical case of a year old girl who is blatantly manipulating her mother regardless i know this family and i know that trying to explain this would go in one ear and out the other so i respond in my most sicklysweet customer service voice ah well im sorry emw was crying after practice but i was trying to keep her as healthy as possible see when she got here late i asked her to warm up on her own while we went to tumbling as soon as she finished she got through two turns before complaining that her ankle hurt i had her sit and ice it for minutes take the ice off for then had her come try tumbling again she said it still hurt so i had her do the legankle injury conditioning list so that she was still working while giving her ankle a break mom okay but then why didnt you let her do trampoline understandable question but i was so sick of this girl coming up to me demanding to do trampoline insisting that her ankle felt better and that i was just a horrible mean person that i had had enough of the way she was treating me i explained to the mother that if the impact of using nothing but a spring floor and her own momentum caused pain in emws ankle so badly that she couldnt tumble adding a trampoline into that mix would absolutely cause her excruciating pain i didnt want her to further injure herself so i had her finish the list this is where it gets insane this is where i legitimately expect to lose my stuffing her mom decided to inform me emw was just being dramatic im sure her ankle wasnt as bad as it seemed she just doesnt like tumbling im sure you know that she wanted to do trampoline though and i dont understand why you wouldnt let her just because she was pretending to get hurt what no seriously what my mind was absolutely blown i was so infuriated i was tempted to kick her out right then and there but alas i kept my voice steady and my smile permanently plastered as i informed this mother im sorry mrs last name here at gym name we take athlete health and injuries very seriously i had no way of knowing whether emws ankle was barely twisted or about to fall off i had nothing but emws word to decide what to do when an athlete says they are in that much pain i cannot in good conscience allow them to further injure themselves if emw wants to be a part of gymnastics she has to practice gymnastics if she wants to be a part of trampoline there is a name of a business with wall to wall trampolines and a history of a lot of injuries that is pretty popular on the west coast about minutes away she huffed out and said that emw wasnt feeling well and would not be coming to night practice today i asked that she make sure emw gets some ice on that ankle as she walked out the door i called the owner as soon as the mother left and let her know what happened she just laughed and said shed take care of it if she got a call sorry for the wall of text and if there is somewhere better to put this please let me know but i really just needed to get that out there edit i realized some of you might not know what conditioning is its basically the strength part of gymnastics pushups situps pullups things like that where you arent actually doing anything completely gymnastics related just focusing on building muscle and endurance edit obligatory holy shit im on the front page edit but seriously thank you to everyone who upvoted and everyone who commented yall made my day so much better if anyone was wondering second practice went very well and we even played a game at the end of practice one of the girls asked where emw was and i explained that she was resting her ankle one of my other girls asked you know she was faking right my only response was i know and we moved on very good very productive practice i love my job
background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of july and new years eve story saying that we get a lot of interesting characters at the fireworks tent is an understatement of epic proportions its the equivalent of saying miley cyrus has changed since appearing on hanna montana one of our regulars is affectionately known as batman the first time i met him he arrived at the tent riding a bicycle i should mention he was then and looking for a very specific type of firework he wanted something small less than inch in diameter that would shoot flaming balls or some other object preferably that exploded on impact it also had to be less than inches long in retrospect i probably should have been more curious or concerned about his requirements in all honesty i get so many strange questions and requests i dont think his went above a on my weird shit meter i spent some time walking around with him and showing him different fireworks that might fit his needs i suggested possibly a roman candle trimmed down in length since most of the tube is just empty space anyway he browsed for a while and then left without buying anything a few hours later he peddled up to my tent again and asked if there was someplace private that we could talk i was busy but now i was definitely more than a little curious i led him outside of the tent and into my onsite storage container reaching into his backpack he pulled out a set of black batman forearm guards similar to but made completely out of metal there was a metal cylinder that ran the length of the guard to support the blades he had pulled the end off of the cylinder and wanted to shove the fireworks in the hole so that they could shoot out i stupidly asked him what this was for and he looked at me dead in the eyes and told me that he couldnt say yes its like that one perfect moment where time slows down and everything inexplicably comes together to create a magical point in time its like hitting the homerun in the bottom of the ninth inning to come from behind and win the big game its like looking up and seeing the lottery numbers you picked displayed on screen after the drawing its like watching your newborn baby draw their first breath i was about to supply batshit crazy batman with his weapons i spent the next hour personally modifying roman candles so that they would fit in the cylinder i provided him with a generous supply no charge of course how can you charge batman for his weapons he solemnly thanked me climbed onto his bicycle and pedaled off into the sunset i anxiously watched the news every night for weeks waiting for the tales of his exploits alas they never appeared obviously covered up by the corrupt media in partnership with the underworld bosses i see him every year back at the tent and browsing for fireworks when our eyes lock we exchange a knowing nod and i always inquire as to whether he needs any moresupplies he has not obviously hes now importing them from china in mass quantities under a fictitious company name so as to avoid suspicion and so it begins if youre interested ive posted a few other stories 
so this just happened about minutes ago i work for a courier and its not that busy in the mornings but today was unusually busy im doing a shipment for a lady and this guy comes in asking if we send express mail and he has important documents to send remember this for later i say yes we offer that service and give him an express envelope to put his stuff in he seals the envelope immediately and asks if we do same day local delivery again i say yes we offer that service but because he sealed the envelope already i just needed him to write the address of the receiver on a sticker so he doesnt need to take his documents out of his envelope for same day delivery we have to call a driver over so theres no need to print a label and all that apparently that was too much effort for this guy and goes wow you guys have absolutely no clue what youre doing im going to another location let me talk to your manager i am the manager im and asian so i probably look like im fuck this im out what happened next was totally unexpected and hilarious our express envelopes have a little strip you can tear down so you can open it without ruining the whole thing but mr hulk here had a little lapse in judgement so instead of tearing through the small strip he literally tore the envelope from top to bottom destroying his precious documents as soon as he did that he just stood there stunned and i just burst out laughing and giggling and told him to gtfo the store his face was red with embarrassment and he just stormed out with his ruined documents tldr dont piss in your own cereal edit formatting posting from phone
i work at a large retail pet chain we are constantly understaffed for example today for a saturday it was me in pet care a cashier and one manager it was awful my manager posted some comments we got on a survey and i swear i want to meet the people who wrote this a hug them why less than satisfied the line was long cashier called for help and it was a long time before anyone showed up manager was not helping he was walking around beautiful edit on break currently store manager yelled at us because our offering of assistance scores were extremely low huh i wonder why 
so i work at an autopart store and today i had the most amazing thing happen so this old lady comes in and i greet her and ask if she needs any help well her car battery turned out to be bad and she needed a new one so i looked it up and it cost after turning in her old one she agrees and i go grab it i ring it up and with the core charge it comes out to around she slides her debit card and it gets declined she kind of sighs and she gets out her credit card and it is declined again i can see she is almost in tears so i decide to remove the core charge in good faith that she will bring the old battery in and i take off the purchase she is very thankful and we try to slide her card again and its declined now im feeling very bad there was a lady that was being helped right next to us and she notices that the card was declined she asks the lady if everything is okay the old lady answers that shes okay but unfortunately doesnt have enough to buy the battery she then tells me that she will be back to buy the battery after she goes and borrows some money from one of her siblings then the amazing thing happens the other lady tells her not to worry that she will buy the battery for her the old lady burst into tears and tells the other lady that its fine she doesnt have to do it but the lady doesnt take no for an answer she swipes her card and pays for the battery this old lady is in tears im trying my best not to cry and so is my other coworker the lady tells the old lady that she had recently got some money from an inheritance and that she didnt really need it so she figured she would do a good deed and help someone out in need i ask the old lady if she had anyone to put her new battery in and she replied no that she was planning on taking it to a shop i told her not to worry that i would install her battery in for her she started crying again and hugs the other lady and then runs up to me and hugs me i drove her to where her car was stranded and changed her battery she was so thankful and told me that today would have been a horrible day if it wasnt for me and the other lady she tried to hand me a bill for gas but i refused telling her this was my good deed for the day ive never seen such an act of kindness like i did today and i will never forget this day tldr old lady doesnt have enough to buy a car battery random stranger buys the battery for her out of kindness and then i gave her a ride to her car and installed the battery for her there was a lot of tears shed today by everyone edit thanks for the gold

background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square feet of fireworks heaven story welcome to the week of scam artists they rarely get away with it but that sure doesnt stop them from trying one of my cashiers was ringing up a large order when she flagged me down she noticed that the price sticker on one of the items was wrong and wanted to let me know so we could fix it we occasionally screw up once again im talking about you josh and misprice stuff when we do we always sell it to the customer at the marked price since it was our fault well then go back and fix the mistake on any remaining inventory on the shelf the item was a large mortar kit that retails for buy get free the price tag on it said so the female customer was definitely going to get a deal on our screwup i walked over to the shelf to check the price on the remaining products but they all seem to be ok so i went back to helping other customers a minute later i get flagged down again for another price check its another large item and its priced for less than half of what it normally sells for i make a mental note to castrate josh then go to check out the remaining items once again they all seem to be priced correctly but i did notice that a different package on the shelf was totally missing a price tag i grabbed a price gun and tagged the package missing a sticker i barely finished putting a sticker on the item when im flagged down again now the customer starts fuming and berating my cashier about what screw ups we are she really starts to raise hell so i apologize and tell her that well take care of the issue i also remind her that even though the items were mispriced we were giving them to her at the lower price i go to check the item on the shelf and once again all of the remaining inventory seems to be priced right now my spider sense is tingling i walked back to the counter to help the cashier ring in the rest of the items amazingly i noticed that at all of the larger items that the woman has brought to the counter are mispriced all of her large items no matter what the original price now have a price tag of i stopped the transaction looked the lady in the eye and told her im not selling you anything and you need to leave now do you remember the scene from the movie the exorcist where father merrin max von sydow tries to expel the demon from reagan linda blair the scene that unfolded at my tent was very similar to that but with less head spinning and more swearing im in my s and i honestly believe that i learned a few new words that day she combined swear words and ethnic slurs that im fairly certain have never been used together before she wove an amazing tapestry of obscenity punctuated occasionally by wild arm waving and the liberal use of her middle finger i think she could have honestly set some type of world record but i apparently threw off her rhythm when i started applauding her performance i offered to call the police and have them sort it out but she was apparently uninterested and made a beeline for the door the sad thing was she would have gotten away with it if she had just changed the price on one or two items in retrospect i really need to train my staff better my cashier actually did a great job in spotting the mispriced items but when i started to applaud the impressive display of obscenity none of my staff joined in ill be adding that to our standard operating procedures sop before the upcoming new years eve if youre interested ive posted a few other stories

tldr aerosol cheese aint for sniffin just about years ago i worked my first job at a local grocery fun place to work generally a good group of kids my age so i start in the pet food aisle and after the manager notices i can read the codes i get promoted to pasta where i rotate the stock this leads to another promotion to cereal where i thwart a casual shoplifter with a well placed mouse glue trap tangent he kept a pack of candy bars hidden behind some cereal i noticed it when i was rotating stock asking how to handle it i was allowed to use my best judgement the cops and the owner thought it was enough punishment to just pay for the rack of candy i put promotion in quotes since its just more responsibility with no more money so then just between the holidays i get promoted to dairy since the guy who did it before went on a long vacation so my promotion to dairy came with a bonus i got to call myself the milkman so i notice that there is lots of damaged whipped cream in the back i mean cases the red flag went up when i started the job and i was not doing said whiffits the manager well call him the davestator gets really puzzled when the next shipment comes undamaged and were left with extra cases this is per week davestator finally determines that the previous dairy guy well call him pdg had been doing whiffits in the cooler at the time whipped cream cost about a can so that was worth about tanks of gas every friggin week it wasnt my problem so i let it go so pdg comes back with a tan and is put on cereal whatever a few days go by and someone is eating cheez whiz in the break room i mention to pdg hey did you ever think about how much more gas there is in that to move the cheez out i mean its so much denser than whipped cream ya know what happened next taught me more about the limits of human stupidity namely that there are none about eight minutes after my aerosol cheese versus cream gas power conjecture i am coming out of the break room i turn to see pdg spread eagle in the snack aisle a half empty can of whiz is rolling away from him as he is coughing up yellow a telltale dribble rolling out his right nostril i didnt think he would actually try it especially in the middle of the store davestator is sitting in his observation cube up front trying very hard not to laugh he composes himself having to blow his nose to clear the tears of hilarity and makes his way to the scene davestator genuinely liked young adults so with a look of sadness he stood over pdg and said i am sure i dont have to explain why youre fired he looks at me and i immediately say i didnt think he would be dumb enough to try it i was just joking he just winked at me and told me to get the spill kit thanks for listening
i work in a big chain store in australia one of those stores that sell clothes and pet food and fishing gear and makeup all in one convenient location you know the sort i was working a long shift as door greeter a few weeks ago we do basic loss prevention too but the furthest i can go is checking peoples bags and stopping them if they set off our alarms when they leave so the scene is set enter stage left a family unit mother adult daughter and apparently overtired father in full dadjoke mode as they walk into the store the dad sees me and shoots his arms up puts on a cheesy grin and yells strip search his daughter fades carefully into the background as i shake my head at this guy he puts on a pout and says aw you dont wanna strip search me before i know it the words spill out of my mouth nah only the attractive people and then my brain kicked in ohmygod what the fuck did i just say holy sh just as i was about to implode the dad roars with laughter slaps me on the back and promises to put on some pretty makeup for me on his way back out it still took me a good ten minutes to get over my splitsecond panic attack

sorry in advance for any formatting issues i was zoning late last night in the toy department when i heard the most dreaded noises the laughter of a small child as he began to play with all the talking action figures i had just fixed i sighed and prepared myself for having to redo the aisles after a bit i returned to see how bad it was only to see the father patiently standing behind his little boy showing him other neat toys he could choice from and cleaning up what little mess the child was making eventually the little boy settled on a star wars darth vadar mask just the cheap little face mask no lights or sound effects his dad helped put in on and the little boy preceded to march around the rest of the store all the while attempting to sing the imperial marchexcept he was so young all he could manage was repeatedly signing doo doo doo doo doo as he walked dad picked it up though and hummed the rest of the song as they shopped i laughed and the dad smiled and said the darkside is strong in this one anytime the little boy marched away his dad would say vadar come on down here and he would return singing his little doo doo doo i laugh that i dont like children that much but little vadar was the cutest well behaved child i have ever seen 
i work in a really high end designers evening gown boutique in a major city were talking dresses costing upwards of so im guessing you can all predict the high maintenance types we come across on a daily basis but this one customer still stands out to me she was a typical trophy wife who came armed with a superiority complex and a pair of heels she wanted to try on everything in the store to see what matched the shoes best after trying on the a few dresses the assistant helping her noticed shed just dumped the dresses shed already tried on the ground and was standing on them in her heels assuming the customer was just absent minded my coworker politely asked if she could pick up the dresses and rehang them just to ensure they didnt get damaged reasonable request for a cool k worth of dresses sitting on the ground right this customer snapped at our staffer and during the rest of her stay continued to dump the rest of the dresses she tried on the ground and continued walking all over them in her heels eventually our manager entered the change room and assertively but still politely requested that she pick up the dresses on the floor to keep them from being pulled or damaged only to be called out as being rude by this customer i remember her saying something like you are so rude i respect my own clothes and for you to imply that i might damage one of your dresses is just unforgivable after leaving the change room in a complete messthe customer comes to the register with a white dress i want this one but ill be needing a discount because it has a dirty footprint on it at this point im pretty sure my manager snapped because the customer is always right even when they arent philosophy she always taught us just went out the window although she stayed deadly calm during this entire exchange manager i cant give you a discount because this is your footprint customer excuse me it isnt my footprint manager it is though i unpacked that dress this morning in our new stock delivery and it had no footprint on it and nobody had tried it on until you did customer shes really irate now how dare you say i damaged this dress im going to call our designers office about this even if i did put the footprint on the dress it was still technically there before i bought it so i shouldnt have to pay full price im sure designer is going to be very interested to hear about your customer service manager feel free to call designer because im sure she would tell you exactly what im going to tell you now our brand doesnt need customers like you and we dont want customers like you good day as my manager calmly walked off into the store and the rest of us supressed our giggles the customer stood there for a second with a slackjawed look before grabbing her tacky designer purse and storming out consequently she did call our designers office and not only did they agree with our managers actions they apparently also invited her to seek her future evening gowns from other labels so great working for a company that backs us retail workers up when we get attacked by a crazy

closer to the end of my shift today a family came into the store it was a mom dad and two daughters probably around and they browsed for a bit and every once in a while i would listen in the mom kept asking the daughters if they had enough money for what they were buying and the girls would think it over and answer when they picked out the items they wanted to buy two disney infinity characters and a game and my coworker told them their total the mom turned to the oldest daughter youre paying for these with your birthday money do you remember how much money you have when the daughter shook her head the mom pulled out her money and slowly counted it with her daughter letting the daughter add up the dollar bills when the girl had decided she had my coworker reminded her that she owed the mom asked her if she had enough money to pay for her new toys the daughter replied yes really hesitantly and her mom encouraged her to be confident in her answer so the daughter handed the money to my coworker who rang up the transaction gave her the change and helped her count it out the daughter thanked us and began to leave carrying the bag but the mom stayed behind to thank us she was trying to help her daughter understand the concept of money and its value and at other places cashiers would get impatient with how long it took the daughter to count her money and decide if it was enough it may seem very insignificant but examples of good parenting coming into my store are few and far between and i thought id share with you all

so i was a cashier working at a major grocery store chain often we have deals with items that are buy one get one free so anyways onto the story i was working as a cashier one night and this lady came up with nothing but items that were bogo buy one get one i always try to strike up conversation with customers to make the time go by so i mention how many good deals shes getting as i scan the items she looks at me and proudly states oh im going take all of these groceries to one of your competitors to get store credit there i do it all the time and they dont seem to mind ive saved so much money doing this i looked at her in confusion she was buying things at our store for off and taking them to a competitor to get a store credit for of their value per item i rang her out but i didnt say anything after that i wanted to tell her off for committing fraud and wasting food but i valued my job
this happened about years ago and popped into my head after reading one of the top threads historic on here im an it engineer by trade and do a lot of travelling and facetoface work with customers so by policy its nice shirts a tie and shiny shoes on a daily basis that regularly end up covered in dust i was out doing some work for a local insurance company faulty server nothing major and got kicked out over lunch hour so i went to their local big brand store to grab a bite to eat i wont name names so there i am waltzing into the store wondering what overpriced treats await me in the hot food section when im stopped in my tracks by an older man in a suit steps in front of me arms crossed face like thunder looks vaguely like jack nicholson asks me what im doing i look confused and have no idea how to respond guess i probably looked at him like he was mental he follows up with gt you were supposed to be here at am this is unacceptable my office now gt me sorry what gt you were supposed to be here at am when i request management cover from another store i expect you on time not when it suits you gt me yeah i think youve mistaken me for someone else sorry gt ryan let me put it this way my office or you wont have a job tomorrow gt me thats not my name i dont work here i think youve mistaken me forthen his actions interrupt me he pulls a face obviously not believing me he gets as close as he can to me physically close enough for a good manly hug then he attempts to herd me towards the door behind him marked staff only waving his arms towards me at waist level like he was trying to waft a fart in my face i also do some teaching parttime at a local college it courses of course so at this point i figure my best line of action is to use angry teacher voicetm gt me right i dont know who you think i am but i dont work here and fuck sake get out of my face it causes him to pause hes obviously catching on that someone junior to him is unlikely to swear at him i can see him staring at my chest im male get your mind out of the gutter of course im wearing the same colored lanyard as his store employees just like he is and im in a suit i probably look like management it dawns on him that he might be wrong and notices the logo on the lanyard is most definitely not that of his store what does he do turns bright red and just walks away doesnt say a word one of their employees was watching this whole thing and burst out laughing he came up to me and we had a brief friendly chat apparently it was one of the junior regional managers that had just accosted me laughs were had i got my delicious cumberland sausage and noticed my receipt was missing about half the items the same employee id had a laugh with had been on checkout guess i got a cheap lunch for keeping someone entertained definitely a very odd encounter i havent been back in that part of the country since or in the same store i wonder if tales are still told of the sharply dressed man that told the regional manager to get the fuck out of his face
seriously who goes to a department store at on a friday and thinks it wouldnt be packed i was on registers last night because they take me off mens all the time cause im amazing at getting people to apply for charge cards i have a line of five people and im helping them as awesomely as always until this old woman gets in line and within two minutes yells you know some of us have places to go she proceeded to scoff loudly and stamp her legs for a whole three minutes before the amazing people in line just laid into her and hammered her to be next it was beautiful oh shit its the center of the universe i didnt realize oh you can go next you seem a bit unstable god i hope no one else has to deal with you today just go first my customers all made her feel so bad her head was shrugged in shame and she barely spoke while she bought her pajamas i gave everyone in that line off im allowed to give discounts to my discretion and they all earned it for standing up for me
on mobile so sorry for any errors this happened around years ago in my retail slave days we were prepping for our end of season sale our sale was huge the entire store is in the sale it takes a lot of preparation all the full price stock is taken down and replaced with sale stock or marked down we have to hang banners and other signage the windows are dressed for sale all the fixtures are changed around or removed its an all hands on deck kinda thing in the day before the sale we close early around pm instead of the usual pm the window has a huge vinyl sticker announcing that we are closed and the glass doors are blacked out with coloured paper our store was in a shopping centre and we had an overflow stockroom at the other end of the centre for this reason we had to keep the doors unlocked closed but unlocked to allow ease of movement for staff bringing stuff to and from the overflow stockroom anywho were all working away around of us a customer opens the door and strolls in not noticing the empty racks boxes piled high staff members sitting on the ground marking stuff down one of the girls turns around and tells her that were closed the customer leaves this happened again and again and again each time a staff member tells the oblivious customer that were closed after about the twentieth person walking in we all looked at the door and shouted were closed completely in sync the customer slowly backed out the door with a look if utter fear on her face it was fucking hilarious
top post in this sub after one day i need new pants everyone has had a coworker like this someone who is disrespectful to the bosses and who snaps at the customers one of my bosses is asian yet born and raised in america and she is incredibly nice one day db foolishly decided to belittle her because of her race in front of at least customers while simultaneously not getting their food mcd lolberries anyway i got a text from db the following sunday asking if i can give him a ride to work as he missed the bus db told me if he doesnt come in they were going to fire him db getting fired sounds petty good to me so i told him i cant give him a ride when i got to work later that day i saw db sitting in the lobby while my store manager is talking to him turns out he found a way to work and they fired him anyway i later found out they only scheduled him to fire him he was on for three hours pmpm on monday and he didnt see anything weird with it the asian manager just wanted to see his face when he found out so they had him come in the store manager being the nice person he is gave him for the bus which douche baggins promptly used to buy a lottery ticket if he lost hed have to walk miles home in the winter he luckily won yet used it to buy alcohol and get drunk in the lobby our asian manager happily kicked his ass out he had no ride home i also got a text from him a few weeks ago asking me for money i didnt respond reddit what are some stories about you getting fired or witnessing someone being fired

im a sales associate at a outlet shoe store thats recently gained a lot more traffic ever since a video featuring our brands shoes we all know where im going with this went viral the way our store is set up we have rows of full price shoes stacked in closed boxes on shelves organized by shoe type at the very front of the store then the rest of the store are rows of open boxes of sale shoes organized by size instead in this story the messy shoe box lady is who we will refer to as msbl the difference between the sale shoes and the full price shoes is very obvious which comes in handy when explaining what shoes are included in our buy one sale shoe get a second sale shoe half off sale we always have its literally shelves not on sale in the entire store fast forward to last night its around we close the store at and it was pretty quiet i started slowly tidying the rows of the sale shoes since theyre open boxes with the shoes on display they oftentimes can get messy quickly and putting all the boxes back in order can be pretty time consuming while im working a woman is looking at the shoes beside me taking a bunch of pairs out of their boxes which shes leaving on the wall still tried them on decides she doesnt like them and then throws the shoes somewhere random instead of putting them back in their box this can kind of be a nightmare for us because not only do we need the barcode on the box should you choose to buy the shoes but hunting the shoe box down in a full store to put the shoes back if you dont buy them can get overwhelming but regardless its part of my job to clean up so i keep quiet i got distracted with a customer who asked for my help and when i came back i noticed the msbl looking at the fullprice shoes and asked if she needed help she then asked if they were included in the sale and when i told her it was only the onsale shoes in the open boxes she huffed and puffed away a few minutes later she came up to my cash and this happened msbl walks up with pairs of shoes sans boxes hello id like to purchase these two pairs of shoes me awesome i do need to scan the barcode on the shoe boxes though would you be able to grab those for me please msbl these shoes didnt have a box they were just laying on the shelf this is bull every single pair of shoes in our store has a matching box we do checks throughout the day to make sure and i was literally just cleaning the racks like i said me unfortunately i cant process the shoe purchase without the barcode i do need the box msbl i dont know why youre being so difficult ill go find some boxes i suppose goes away for a few minutes and comes back with two boxes both of which dont match up to the shoes and are priced at our most reduced price for any of our shoes me hey i dont mean to make this process take so long but these two boxes dont seem to match up with the shoes inside let me try and locate a box for these shoes so we can make this move a bit faster at this point i decide to take a closer look at the shoes and see if i can figure out what kind they are after a year or so working with different styles of shoes you somehow quickly learn the random and obscure shoe names thankfully it only took me a whopping seconds to realize these are our two classic shoes which are full price which never go on sale which are currently retailing for dollars a pair shocking me these two are actually full price shoes that do not go on sale they currently cost dollars and the sale would not apply to them did you still want to purchase them msbl this is ridiculous i found them in these two boxes and you need to honour it get me your manager you have terrible customer service skills keep in mind my manager is a badass who always sticks up for us i was so stoked she asked me to call him over little did i know he was listening to the whole time and prepped for the situation manager walks over with the corresponding full price shoe boxes inside of which contain the two cheaper shoes she obviously swapped boxes with when no one was looking i do apologize but i have to stand behind my employee on this one as it looks as though the shoes were swapped were unable to honour an incorrect box price when it is obvious someone has intentionally switched boxes she got so nervous and i have never seen a woman run out faster of the store in my entire life

so i run my own store photo studio where we photograph people they select what photos they want prints digital canvas mugs on wood etcetera had a customer in yesterday who started complaining about the photo paper not the photo the paper being of bad quality and she wanted her money back now i know my paper i print on the best kodak paper i can get my hands on there simply is no way in the world that the quality is bad it survives a bath in coca cola wipe it off with a cleaning agent possible colours dont fade like they used to difficult to tear up the whole nine yards so after hearing her tirade and responding she was gave up threw out one last remark im going to give you a bad review and im gonna make sure you get fired my retort like hell you are i own this place goodbye angry customer me tldr the magical retail fairy brought me a present
i work at a bridal store bridezillas are a rarity those are some fun stories but the moms can get pretty bad yesterday a bride and her mother come in to try on some wedding gowns as they were looking through the store they spot the seamstress in the back of store pressing and steaming someone elses wedding gown now there is a doorway and a curtain separating the front of the store from the back where the main office is and where the seamstresses do their work its pretty clear only employees are allowed back there but no the mother just strolls back there picks up the train of the dress while the seamstress is working on it and says oh honey look at this one this is gorgeous you need to try it on i promptly hurry back there because thats an area she should not be in and i really did not want her touching someone elses dress i tell her that it is indeed someone elses dress her daughter cannot try that specific dress on but i will gladly look in our inventory to see if we still have the gown she seemed confused but made her way back to the front of the store i look it up and turns out we dont have that dress as a sample because it came through a trunk show which i tell her and then proceed to suggest similar styles we do have in stock while the daughter accepted this fact the mother got a bit hostile mom so if you dont have it let her try that one in the back on me im sorry but i cant this is someone elses wedding gown that was specifically ordered for her mom so me so this is her dress not a sample we make a promise to our customers that their dresses will be safe and treated right mom just let her slip it on shell be extra careful me maam this womans wedding is this weekend the seamstress is already half way through pressing it your daughter will not be trying this dress on daughter mom let it go i have enough dresses to try mom huffs off to look for even more gowns and my coworker and i exchange wide eye glances then while her daughter is in the middle of trying dresses she goes back there again and says well look at this one dear this dress has this and this and this and that dress doesnt i still think you should try this on at this point i get a little rude maam i apologize but you cannot go to the backroom and interfere with the seamstress while she is working your daughter will not be trying that dress on and that is final she again huffs off back to her seat and sits there until they leave at which point my coworker and i burst out laughing at that ridiculous woman i know its not even remotely as bad as what some of you guys get but like come on lady use common sense edit well this is a cool response you guys are hilarious i have a real doozy of a story ill be posting tomorrow of a slightly crazy bridezilla since you guys want more stories thanks tfr

background i worked in an electronic component store the kind of store you would go when you need a button a switch a board and wires for your project or your kids school projects i used to be a customer there before i got hired as a part time while i was in school i liked the job i was assigned to the computer department we did not sell or repair computers we would sell accessories and a lot of routers at the time of this story it was my first few months working there story one day on my day off i went there to buy audio wires and few cables to wire my sound system and plug my computer to the tv sound system i had the idea in the morning and genius me decided to go buy them now so i was there minding my busyness business when enters sc stupid customer he was a regular which came every one or weeks and bought a lot of computer accessories and other things in the store i was far from the department i would work but he still recognized me without my official uniform sc hey you now since it was crowded i did not give a damn people try to get the attention on the floor staff all the time sc im talking to you at this point i turn around as did many people sc are you going to help me or what while pointing at me me points at myself me i am not working today sir i am actually shopping just like you you can ask any other employee that has their uniform on and they will gladly help you sc didnt like that at all sc no you are going to help me or i will fill a complaint i have no time to find another person and it is too crowded so tell me where i could find brand and gauge of speaker wire me sir even if i would be working right now i do not know anything about this you would need to ask someone in the wiring department sc is staring me down at this point i know what is coming next so i turn around and ask an employee behind a counter to call the manager it literally went that way me to employee can you please call the stor sc get me your fuing manager so that basically ruined my morning i was getting shit from a customer when i was not even working if i would have known where his item was i would have told him at least but i didnt the manager came and saw me lets call him stm for store manager stm what can i do for you sc your useless employee doesnt want to help me i want to file a complaint stm are you working today linked me no i am not stm to sc so why are you asking linked to help you when he doesnt have his uniform on there are employees on the floor that will gladly help you sc is now firing lasers out of his eyes and probably about to shit a nuclear bomb at this point sc i dont fuing care he has to help he works here now where do i file a damn complaint stm and i were just shocked then he went to the service desk to make sc file a complaint once the complaint was filled stm took the form and shredded it in from of him i was too far to hear anything but seeing that just made my day beautiful again tldr cyclops from xmen came in to shop when suddenly confetti and unicorns edit typing is hard and serious busyness business manly tear edit woah thanks for the tfr quote of the day highlight d
i was working at a relatively small convenience store in a village it was around pm so the kids had finished school and were coming home on the bus this was usually a very busy time as the bus stop was opposite the shop so a lot of them came into the shop with a few pounds in change and bought sweets drinks etc no real problem there in fact i enjoyed serving them as they were clearly looking forward to their sugary goodness after a day at school anyway i serve some kid a ml energy drink it was quite popular since my company stocked a p pmp version instead of the nonpmp version that the supermarkets sold for the kid was around thirteen it turns out but looked ish he leaves happy five minutes later the boys mother comes in furious at me how dare you serve this energy drink to my son she says its against the law its not for children i explain that im sorry to have served her son and that while company policy says that i should serve everyone if they have the right money and there isnt a law against serving them ie alcohol tobacco lottery etc im sure that a written letter asking us not to serve her son again would prevent any repeat of this she wasnt having it she was demanding a refund not going to happen the drink was halffinished and if i processed a refund id get a formal warning from management for going against refund policy obviously i didnt tell her this as she wouldnt care if i received a warning she wanted me fired anyway so i begrudgingly gave her of my own money thinking that would be that nope turns out that she had phoned the police saying that a shop had served an underage customer something illegal the police arrived about fifteen minutes later probably because if i had served the child alcohol id get prosecuted and face a fine and criminal record and the shop could lose its premises licence so quite serious the police officer spoke to the woman asking her to explain what happened he looked a little confused i explained that the company didnt have a policy against selling energy drinks to kids that i was sorry to have caused offence and that the matter could be dealt with by the store manager who by this point had got back from her minute cigarette break the police officer gave the worst deathstare to the woman for wasting his time and told us that we should refrain from serving her son energy drinks after one hour of wasted time and a police callout she gave up on her quest to get me fired and left tldr woman sees her son is served an energy drink phones police before confronting me police pissed off at wasted time edit its rare that i do this but thanks for the internet points its really brightened my day to know that there are people who understand my point of view have experience in a similar situation or at least think that the woman was an idiot thanks

when i was pregnant in i was saving up money by selling bread at farmers markets i enjoyed sitting under a canopy chatting with the other vendors and interacting with the customers the people who bought my bread were usually nice and fell into the categories of soccer moms old ladies or young male hipsters i sold organic vegan bread and glutenfree pastries lots of people always commented on my baby bump asking about the gender or due date and congratulating me on my pregnancy the second to last time that i worked at this farmers market in particular three ladies in their s or s approached my booth i recognized two of the generally pleasant ladies but not the third this is the girl that weve been telling you about the one thats going to have the baby one of my regular customers said to the youngest looking of the bunch how old are you hun i told her that i was you married she asked she spoke quickly and i remember it sounding like she was a clucking chicken no but ill wrangle a proposal out of my boyfriend some day i said smiling even though i always hate when people asked hun weve been telling this lady all about you one of the regulars said to the unfamiliar face this is ladys name and she wants to adopt your baby what was that i thought i was mishearing these ladies you should let me adopt your baby sweetheart youre too young to have a kid youd be a horrible mother i was hormonal pregnant woman that had been working a long hot day in a parking lot and i wanted to kill her i wanted to gouge her eyes out with baguettes but i somehow managed to keep calm im not interested in putting my child up for adoption sorry so can i interest you ladies in any breads today can you at least consider it i can give you some money maybe you can go to school and make something of yourself to this day i still dont know how i didnt kill those three ladies can you excuse me a moment i went over to the jewelry vendors next to my tent we knew each other well because of the numerous farmers markets they also set up shop at throughout the week they were the ones who usually helped me set up my tent and tables we watched each others tables when we needed restroom breaks i asked them if they could watch my stand and they did when i got back from the restroom after mentally rehearsing an angry comeback they were gone one of the regulars stopped by my booth the following week and told me she wasnt buying my bread anymore because of how rude i was to her friend later the lady wanting to buy my kid stopped by and asked if i had given it any thought at all i told her no i switched farmers markets with my grandpa after that the next week he told me that some ladies had been asking about my baby
this happened a while ago but has really stuck with me and i like to think about it on really bad days at work i had been working all day in the aquatics department of my store dealing with all manner of rude condescending customers when this little boy maybe or years old and a woman whom i had assumed was his mother came in they were looking to buy some fish for the tank that the little boy had gotten for his birthday he came right on up to me grabbed my hand and asked me very politely if i could find him some fish that would be happy to come live with me my heart just about melted i told him that i most certainly could and asked him if he could ask his mom who was a little ways off looking at the betta fish what size his tank was so we could get started he replied she isnt my mommy she is my all pears the woman over heard this and saw my obviously confused face and explained that she was his nanny and that his parents called her an au pair once and he had liked the way it sounded but apparently couldnt pronounce it correctly i helped them find some fish for his gallon tank some mollies and a couple of swordtails and when i had finished bagging them up and handed them off to the all pears the little boy gave a little tug on my apron and thanked me for helping them he also asked if he could give me a hug and take a picture with me and his new fish so i knelt down to his level and let him throw an arm around me while his other hand held the bag of fish and the nanny took our picture it was just the sweetest thing i have ever had happen to me at work the nanny came in about a week later when i was working to get more food for the fish and told me that the little boy had asked her to print the picture out and that now it sits on his desk right next to his tank where the fish can see it so that they dont miss their old house and their old friends it makes me smile ever time i think about that little boy and his nanny even though i havent seen them since that last time the nanny came in he was so sweet and polite and just really made my day that day 
 so yesterday was surprisingly quiet for the week before christmas but i had a older woman in her s come through i know because i had to card her for a pack of beer she paid with debit wanting bucks cash back she then asks as my till pops asking is i can give her all ones i made the comment it might help since i had a waitress come through an hour earlier and i had a lot of ones so i was in the middle of counting when she goes my granddaughter is taking me to my first strip club i lost track of my counting and looked up she had a huge smile on her face all i could say was well alright then i recounted her change and gave it to her she left and my coworker on the till next to me looks over and said that was weird as hell all i could do was nod and go yup 
this was all yesterday the store i work in has a department that does framing and custom mat cutting so customers can bring in whatever they want framed and often we can do it for them the same day anyways i was covering this department due to the usual guy being sick and things were pretty quiet all day until i got a gentleman at the desk who brought in a portrait drawing very well done btw looking to preserve it as well as give it a nice look after some looking at what we had available some choices on the color and sizing of matting some paperwork for me to work on it and some talking about the picture itself i learned it was an incredibly valuable and sentimental drawing of this mans now deceased brother i didnt ask further for obvious reasons the portrait was incredibly lifelike and i can only assume accurate which i think was making the man a little distressed by looking at it his eyes were going a little red and he was getting a little more quiet as the afternoon went on so i felt it best to let him and his wife walk around while i did all the work for an hour or so after all the work i call him back to the desk and show him the results a really nice monochromatic scale of two mats one silvergrey and one solid black with a silver frame polished with slight black spots in the molding cleaned up glass probably the hardest part of framing and a wire hanger we walk up to the register for me to give the frame to the cashier and he has me call up my manager while he waits in line im a bit worried and confused since managers are usually called to deal with upset customers and i thought i did alright as i try to think back anything i might have done wrong my manager shows up and the guy pulls him aside and whispers something to my manager that makes him grin from ear to ear then turns to me and tells me how grateful he is for the work he gives me a hard pat on the shoulder with red eyes and passes a tip into my pocket which i assume was him whispering permission from my manager from earlier im awestruck by such generosity since i was just doing my job and i can see then that this picture means much more to him than i could really ever appreciate framing something so sentimental is sort of cheating because i certainly didnt make something so impactful on his life in the hour i spent working but the end result rides off the emotional value the picture originally held while increasing its ascetic and functional value making me look like a superhero for doing something so basic after receiving the highest praise in my entire career in front of my manager and peers i remembered that yesterday was my last day working at that store i start a new job on monday i guess i get to leave on a highnote
i work in an adult shop in a predominantly gay area of my city lots of stories that can be found short one from yesterday that literally had me laughing out loud a bit of background required our shop has some old signs at the bottom of the rather steep set of stairs that you need to climb to enter the shop they are from a sale the boss had long before i started working in the shop just over a year ago the signs are for dvds that were on sale no titles are given but the sign does give some cheap prices for dvds purchased and indicates that multiple dvd purchases makes the prices cheaper still to yesterday i spot an old wizened man coming up the stairs dragging one of those old wheeled shopping carts you usually see little old ladies dragging around he would have been in his late s or older he leaves the cart at the first landing and continues up to the shop looks around a little confused him hmmm i saw your sign for dvds and thought you might have the sound of music but now that i look around i think just maybe i might be in the wrong place me sir i am sorry but you most definitely are in the wrong place him as he starts to smile looking around i bet you think this is funny dont you me yes sir i have to admit i think it is hilarious him as he starts laughing well i think it is pretty funny too i cracked up at that point as he laughing away to himself exited back down the stairs 
i work in a bakery as the donut girl and am training to decorate cakes yesterday i was there by myself with a bread baker but my bakery manager was on lunch in the sitting area next to the bakery this lady had a cake order that was difficult to understand so i waited until she arrived to finish it she gets here and i explain it to her and she goes oh so its not finished can i get ninja turtles instead we have ninja turtle cake kit and i show it to her she asks if i can just draw a ninja turtle on there i say probably not i asked my manager anf she said absolutely not the lady was irritated well why cant you just draw it its a copywrited image i could be fined for drawing it but i want ninja turtles we can put the kit on there its only thats too much what if we pretend you never looked at the toy can you draw it no she gave up after another five minutes of this and got another design for her cake but seriously she was ok with me getting fined just for the stupid little cake

 i have a regular customer who is about years old and is somewhere on the autism spectrum hes not the easiest kid to be around hes generally pretty hostile and is pretty strident in his views about everything but i dont take it personally and im not supposed to its just his way but i always make a point of saying hello and goodbye and trying to hear what hes trying to tell me when hes being imperious it finally got warm enough for him to ride his bike here and so ive seen a lot more of him lately on wednesday he was here before i got in and he yelled at me for keeping him waiting i told him i was a bit later than usual because my cat needed attention but i was sorry that he was frustrated with waiting then i complimented him on his captain america hoodie and he saluted me so i knew we were friends again he came in today to pick up a book he ordered he brought in his official harry potter elder wand to show me it was pretty cool and i told him so he gave me the money for his book and when i walked back to the counter with his change he shouted expelliamus so i lurched like he had really done it and tossed his pennies at him he actually smiled at me then he shouted crucio i said no unforgivable curses in the store but its okay i could tell you didnt really mean it since it didnt even come close to working he was so happy and so am i im such a hufflepuff
another tale from absurdly friendly neighborhood drivethru my fellow tfrians todays tale takes place not in the cashier booth not in the kitchen not in the parking lot but in the bathroom yes the bathroom while im working i begin to experience a bit of a rumblin in my gut and as is custom i answer natures call she seems to have me on speeddial our mens room features the following amenities toilet stall two urinals and a sink i take up position on the toilet and enjoy the relative quiet while i do my biological duty i hear the bathroom door swing open followed by the shuffling of feet positioning in front of a urinal nothing out of the ordinary then comes the faint sound of a zipper opening and a slight grunt from its owner sounds like an elderly gent seems normal then came the sound of more grunting okay hes old hard to pee sometimes makes sense but no the sound of a stream of urine splashing against porcelain was not the next noise to be heard the next sounds to be heard were a series soft patting noises almost rhythmic more grunting followed the cacophony of patting and grunting echoing through the bathroom grew in intensity over the next minute a terrible realization dawned over me as i sat in the stall that i had hoped to be my personal bastille against the horrors that transpired just a couple of feet away i tried to block it out it did not work a voice in the back of my mind screamed in agony this patting noise seems familiar no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no ew eeewwwwww fap fap grunt fap fap fap grunt fap oh god no why is this happening fap grunt fap fap please any god every god let this end fap fap fap there is no decency in this world fap fap moan its over and then to compound the squick factor at work i hear him softly mutter oh that was good good show did he justno oh god no oh merciful shit no was i just on the receiving end of a penisserenade from a perverted old voyeur in the bathroom at work my body completely locked up i fought back the urge to vomit i was quickly snapped from my state of shock by the sound of a urinal flush and the shuffling of feet i was relieved to hear that the man whom just inflicted me with a masturbatory ambush was leaving the bathroom i do hope he was not expecting any thanks from me for his performance i quickly returned to a state of shock when i next heard the bathroom door swing open and footshuffles fading into the distance he did not wash his hands the next two minutes of my life were spent cringing and questioning every single decision in my life that brought me to this moment tldr i entered the bathroom a hopeful cheerful optimistic person the horrors i endured in there had left me a broken disheveled utterly destroyed shell of the man i once was there is no good in the world god is dead hope is a lie
last summer i worked in a big grocery store that also sold some hot dogs and ice cream for hungry customers we sold french hot dogs the ones where the bread is a baguette with a hole in it and you eat upright since the dressing has to go in before the hot dog we did this for the customers one day dressing man comes in and buys a french hot dog gt dm i want a lot of dressing a lot gt me hi ill do my best there you go gt dm no more than that thats not enough gt me okay heres some more dressing for you at this point already there is hardly any room for the hot dog gt dm no more i always get this much dressing when i come here the girl from last week did it just fine gt me im sorry there has to be room left for the hot dog or the bread will crack no one could fit more dressing in this baguette gt dm just a liiittle bit more i give him another squeeze of dressing and he mutters not satisfied with the amount but takes his hot dog and walks away ten minutes later he comes back gt dm i want a new one the bread broke and now theres dressing everywhere i notice he has eaten more than of it gt me im sorry ill get you a newwait youve already eaten it gt dm not all of it and the bread just broke i demand a new one gt me im sorry i cant give you a new one when youve already eaten it the bread always breaks in the end with that much dressing he mutters something about never shopping here again and walks away i wonder how many times he has pulled this stunt to get new hot dogs over and over

so thanks to the huge response my first received the other day yall are getting one more albeit not as great as that tale incidentally this story also deals with credit cards it takes place a year ago shortly after i was first hired parttime at the little convenience store i now work at fulltime days a week its an otherwise slow and uneventful sunday around am most in this town are at church at this time including the owner and general manager of the store im manning the place on my own for the first time the responsibility was nice a bit intimidating even as im used to having managers surround me at all times while on the clock it was nice to do this though and i figured today would be a calm day not so a gal who looks to be early s walks in first customer of the day she sticks a cold beer on the counter and asks for two lotto tickets and a pack of cigs pretty standard convenience store transaction until she gets out her credit card this woman did not understand credit at all she asks why it didnt require a pin i explain that usually debit cards require pins this dumbfounded her then as the card is processing those dreaded words appear declined i ask if she has something else she pulls out another card swipes it and it works this hilarious exchange follows her dont you just love credit i hear people complaining about it all the time but i dont get it its free money you know am i right or what no lady youre not
posting from mobile sorry in advance for spelling to start things off this was last year when i had broken my right hand which was also my writing hand i had a cast that went all the way up to my elbow and my fingers were a lovely purple colour so it was pretty obvious that i was injured still in pain and looking like mega man i soldier on and go to work a few days after my accident and just work the register i work in a card and gift store so it wasnt too tough using the one hand and most of the customers were pretty understanding and patient then this lady comes to the counter with a card i say hi and smile she says nothing and throws the card on the counter i scan it through tell her the amount complete the sale blah blah blah still no word or even a smile i bag up her card awkwardly with my one hand and pass it over to her but she instantly rips it out of the bag and places it back on the counter lady customer i need you to write in this card for me this happens pretty often and i would usually do it but obvs cant with a broken hand me im really sorry i usually would but points to cast ive broken my hand and cant even grasp a pen if i wanted to lady customer sighs just try me i i really cant my hand is broken lady customer for gods sake its not that hard use your other hand then me im not left handed so its going to be really messy though she grunts and sighs and insists i just try so i get a piece of paper and ask her what she wants written to see how well i can write with my left hand it was pretty pathetic but hey ive never been forced to write with my left hand what do you expect im halfway through writing the name on the piece of paper when she grabs the card off the counter and says oh my god ill just do it my self and storms out bitch really sorry for having a broken hand and not thinking about how you might need me to write your own damn card out for you how can she even have friends to buy cards for 
edit im not looking for any any karma for this i think its want any human being would do unfortunately there are a lot of nonhumans running things when i was in college s i worked at a fast food place that was right across from a large college campus in a very liberal southern city a lot of hippies homeless people etc hung out near campus we would regularly have two or three people in their late teens early twenties come in to the store come up to the counter and ask for packets of salt these folks looked like any other hippie that walked into our store i would give them packets and think nothing of it then a coworker told me they were homeless and using the salt to add flavor to the dry dog food they lived off of it made me sad after a few weeks of doing this once or twice a week my manager who was a royal douchebag told me i could no longer give these people free salt it was costing the store too much money i explained to him that these folks were eating dog food to survive and i would happily pay for the salt if he told me how much it was he refused and told me i could not give out any more salt so i did what any normal redblooded american would do whenever these folks came in and ask for free salt i would tell them i was sorry but i couldnt give out any salt unless they ordered something at the same time i casually handed one of them a dollar and asked what they would like to order most of our items were priced at well below a dollar the guy would order a couple of items and ask for salt which i gave him plenty of instead of the packets i had been handing out i gave him packets with his order my douchebag manager couldnt do anything about it because they were ordering food and therefore customers he tried to tell me i could not give them money and i just replied hes a friend of mine i owed him a dollar this store had already been sued successfully for wrongful termination so he didnt want any more lawsuits i continued to do this until i quit about a year later

this happened to me a few years back while i was a store lead assistant to the assistant manager a position that basically gives the authority to override the register and deal with small stuff so the manager doesnt have to and a colored name tag to show the change in status i was building a new floor display when i heard a customer starting to get very vocal in appliances so i went over to see if i could help out i heard his voice escalate and his language became very insulting to the associate who was helping him so i radioed loss prevention to let them know there was a disturbance brewing i was approaching the customer from behind when the beleaguered associate raised his hand to signal me this caused the customer to turn around and face me and i could immediately tell he was on something i dont know if it was booze or drugs but his body odor clouded everything anyway the following is the exchange as i remember it gt inebriated customer finally a fing manager gt me sir im going to have to ask you to lower your voice in the store gt ic ive had it with you fing aholes telling me to calm down i am fing calm fffffffffiinggggggg caaaalllllmmmm gt me sir please dont use that kind and then i heard two loud noises and i was suddenly facing to my left it took a moment to register that i had just been punched by his right hand then his left in quick succession i didnt even see it coming but im still standing just facing left the whole store is quiet as i turn to face him again i am outwardly calm but freaking out internally about what is going to happen next im in ok shape but i dont work out and world of warcraft had taken its toll on my body at this time i have never been in a fight before never even thrown a punch i have no idea what is going to happen next but then as i turn to face him again my neck pops like when you pop your knuckles a very loud pop in the silence that has fallen quick aside i have always been able to make my joints pop not just in my hands but almost every place bones meet elbows knees shoulder neck back jaw whatever so looking this man square in the eye i leaned my head to the right pop then slowly back to the left pop then back to center and he started to cry no words just tears falling down his cheeks probably the sight of loss prevention and the store managers approaching quickly forced him to realize how much trouble he was in he was eventually charged with assault in the fourth degree class a misdemeanor but i like to believe my neck pops just cowed him into submission edit wow front page glad people enjoyed the worstbest story i have from retail 
i work at a home improvement store in the midwest im also half asian so on a biweekly basis im asked insomanywords why are you brown always by white men its terribly annoying here is one such instance its the end of the night and a man in his midtwenties seems excited to see me i can see it in his face hes going to ask the usual question gti hope this isnt annoying but where are you from queue my internal groan gtim from mos eisley gtoh wow ive never heard of there his eager smile is wide and weird where is it gtits on tatooine a mostly desert region gtvery cool i dated a girl from taipei once gtgreat i replied thankfully at this time ive rushed ringing up and checking out his items as we talk i tell him to have a good evening he leaves with a goofy wave and i sigh in disbelief 
the title is a pretty neat tldr and the story explains the rest so without further ado gtphone rings i answer me hello caller yes hello im at other suburbs store and ive just bought some a paper that i wanted to print on but their colour machine isnt working can you print on that me well actually we can print colour and we can print a size but we actually print two up on an a sheet we cant print on a size directly though because the machines just dont understand it no matter which way we try to put it in it just doesnt go in it doesnt feed so we can print for you but not onto that a paper no caller but i had it done at store which closed down four years ago me really caller yeah but theyre closed now me oh are they caller yes me ah short pause caller so can you print on this paper me we can do colour printing thats just fine thatd be in a size though but we cant print onto a paper directly unfortunately caller but i had it done at store me yeah but theyre closed now arent they caller yeah me yeah pause of at least one minute caller hello me yes caller are you still there me yes im still here just wondering if you have any further questions caller well im returning this paper then and with that query essentially resolved we both hung up our phones
so anyone who has worked in retail knows that employees sometimes have to go through or use outdated or unrealistic techniques at my job we have to use open ended questions but not just what brings you into day no we have to ask personal question that have nothing to do with why they came to shop and a lot of times are creepy andor ineffective the whole day my manager had been on my ass for not using the techniques i tried using them but every client i did felt as if i was coming on like a cheesy used car salesman on commission till this happened me gt hello sir what brings you in today customer gt i am looking for a desktop me using the corporate techniques me gt ah okay i must say those are some nice shoes customer gt thanks man me again using the techniques gt so tell me about yourself what are your needs and wants now like i sound like im on a date with the guy customer gt uh yeah i need another computer mine died on me yesterday i just use it for the basics web emails words excel powerpoint etc me gtalright taking notes like im suppose too gt do you mind if i take notes customer gtgo ahead note a lot of customers think its a survey gt what happened to your old computer customer gt kid broke it me gt how many kids do you have at this point my manager is hovering over me making sure i ask these trivial questions instead of just being a regular guy and trying to find him the right product customer gtdoes it matter look man i just want to get a computer me at this point i just kind of want to be real with him but hovering manager gtim sorry sir im just asking question to better help you choose the right computer gtso what do you do for a living customer getting visibly annoyed looks at manager gtare you the manager gtlook man i know you guys have policies but yeah that shit doesnt work customers just want a normal nonforced conversation and to get in and get out in my head gtfinally someone gets it edit gold thank you guys i never would have thought this would have gotten gold i do want to say from my own experience i have gotten better more accurate results and happier clientele that personally come back to see me because i dont treat the customer like they are an idiot i have a normal conversation with that person and i end up selling them warranty or whatever they need to fit their needs i dont need to constantly remind them about our x month financing option every time they see an item i let them know its there i ask questions pertaining to the item they wish to purchase downvote or not but i will tell you when a computer is straight up shit management doesnt like us doing so they like us saying that those computers are our hot buys no they are hot shit a computer with a celeron processor will not play world of warcraft or do heavily multitasking and because of that i naturally build rapport with them not by asking what their favorite color is false compliments and coming off like a commissioned salesman who doesnt care about your experience because i genuinely want you to like your item edit grammer
so i was working today and i had these three hispanic ladies come walking up we had a veterans day coupon out and the head honcho of the group had something like of the exact same coupon and wanted to break them up into split transactions to use all well we obviously cant do that so as she shoves the coupons into my face i let her know that we can only use one even across multiple transactions due to someone abusing the system prior and rendering us unable to do that at this point her limited english completely stops and she starts talking to the two other ladies with her in nothing but spanish the trio starts talking crap on me various levels of insults from how i dont know what im talking about to how i shouldnt have a job and then one of the ladies pipes up gt l in spanish this kid thinks hes hot sht telling us what to do like that gt l in spanish i know right he probably just cant wait to go home and fk his mother tonight so by this point im fuming ive had three years of spanish plus a couple of months in mexico i may be the whitest kid youll find in my state but im fairly wellversed in the spanish language i keep up the charade until their card goes through at this point i rip the receipt from the register gtuepiwssa in spanish so heres a link to a survey we have our customers do just to let us know how were doing i dont fk my mother at night and you saved a total of today heres your receipt have a wonderful day by now all three ladies are looking at me with that horrified look on their faces as theyve now realized that i understood essentially everything they spoke in spanish they shuffle off over to the customer service desk and ask to speak to a manager and i never hear about it again tldr im whiter than a cheesecake and i live in the mountain west area but that doesnt mean i dont know spanish

long time lurker first time poster i work at a gas station we get our fair share of crazies on a daily basis and i could tell you hundreds of stories but today ill tell you just one so on this day it was early in the morning before the sun was even up and rd shift was nearly over i was tired and ready to leave because i had just pulled a double because the rd shifter decided not to show up all alone in the store i was pretty much just getting ready for the soon to come morning rush a lady walks in carrying one of the coffee mugs we sell at our stores when you bring it in and fill it up we charge it as a refill and you save some money she gets over to the coffee pots looks at me looks at them looks back at me and says theres not enough coffee now i had just made two fresh pots of each type of coffee we have so there was plenty of coffee needless to say i was confused i walk over here and look to make sure i wasnt losing my mind and sure enough the coffee was all still there i tell her maam i just made all these pots of coffee not too long ago its all fresh and you can take as much as youd like she replies with no theres not enough to fill my mug you need to make more do it quickly i see she has a oz mug and our coffee pots are oz each so we had oz total of the kind she wanted more than enough to fill her mug i inform her of this and she starts to get agitated saying no i come here all the time and it takes three pots to fill me mug would you please make another one at this point i give up and start brewing another pot of coffee minutes later the coffee is all brewed up she takes it and fills her mug up one whole pot goes in and she smiles at meas if she had proven i was an idiot she grabs a second pot and pours barely any in leaving nearly full pots as much as i wanna rub it in her face that i was right i hold my tongue and wait for her to get to the counter so i can ring her out she puts the cap on her mug and casually starts walking out the door before i stopped her she looks at me funny and says what they usually give it to me free when i have to wait not today lady i tell her well miss we actually arent allowed to do that the only time we can allow that is when the coffee is old and the customer is forced to wait you requested a pot of coffee while there were fresh pots available im going to have to charge you for it now the show begins for this part of the story ccl will stand for be crazy coffee lady ccl what this is ridiculous there wasnt enough coffee me no maam theres was plenty of fresh coffee available for you to use it seems you may have misjudged just how big our coffee pots are ccl no i come here every day it always takes three you must have made them bigger me well i did tell you that the pots were oz each ccl i have been coming to this store for years and this is how you treat me how much is it me that will be do you have your rewards card ccl what how i thought it was youre just trying to rip me off me no mame thats just the tax added to the total ccl im not paying for this she gives me a smug look then i take her coffee mug and place it out of her reach behind the counter me well miss im sorry but i cant let you leave with free coffee i can go dump this coffee out if you want and give you your mug back are you sure you dont want the coffee ccl give me back my mug this is theft ill call the cops me are you wanting to buy the coffee ccl fine yes ill buy it just dont expect to ever see me in here again this is terrible service as expected from a gas station i suppose ahh music to my ears i love it when people say ill never come back makes me feel amazing after interactions like this me alright then like i said before the total is do you have your rewards card ccl look i dont have the cash on me right now ive gone through enough cant you just let me have it its only coffee me sorry maam i cant do that i took her mug to the sink and poured out all the coffee i shed a single tear as i wished it safe journey she flips out one last time at me saying really youre just going to pour it out instead of giving it to me im going to call corporate and get you fired she stormed out of the building got in her truck and peeled out of the parking lot i had a good laugh and couldnt wait for the first shifters to get there so i could tell them this story we get people like this every so often that think theyre clever and can get free stuff out of us but not at my gas station you wont especially if you dont have your rewards card 
back before the national chains drove them out of business there used to be local electronic stores i worked for one of these for a couple of years the store was located in a pretty good neighborhood but not far from a not so good neighborhood one day i was back in the warehouse area checking on something when i heard a commotion from our car install bay i went back to see the installer outside yelling at a guy who was running off carrying something some scrawny crackhead looking guy had walked into the install bay and grabbed a power amp that was sitting in the trunk of a customers car prior to being installed and just ran off with it i told the installer to call and that i would follow the guy and keep him in sight the guy wasnt moving fast at all he looked to weigh about pounds and this was a big amp that probably weighed or pounds he was barely able to get above a fast walk he soon noticed me following him and called out for me to stop or he would kick my ass this seemed unlikely as i was in excellent shape at the time and was experienced in dealing with people wanting to kick my ass from my second job as a nightclub doorman so i continued to follow him a bit later he called out that he had a gun and if i continued to follow him he would shoot me this also seemed unlikely if he actually had a gun he would have led with that instead of the absurd threat of physical violence also i wasnt trying to close with the guy just keep him in sight until the cops arrived i figured i was well out of crackhead pistol range we were in a residential neighborhood and apparently residents were calling in as we passed including one who heard the gun threat soon i was hearing sirens from all directions cars converged on the guy from three directions at once shotguns were pointed instructions were yelled and the guy dropped the amp and went face down on the ground for my part i stood very still with my empty hands in plain view the best part was him yelling threats at me that he had a gun even though he didnt turned his crime from misdemeanor theft into the class a felony of armed robbery instead of the fine and probation he likely would have received he ended up sentenced to twelve years 
about a year ago i was at the cash register at the sub shop i work at when a family comes in nice looking family dad and two sons about and the dad asks the year old alright buddy what would you like the year old orders a sandwich and then the dad orders one for himself i look at the year old who turns to his dad and says i really want a sandwich dad then you should have got an a on your project he mumbles towards the kid but i got a c the little kid says but the dad ignores him and keeps looking at me i stare at him confused and tell him his total he pays and they get their food once again the kid asks for a sandwich the dad tells him he can have left overs when he gets home to my shock dad and older brother eat their food at the restaurant with this little kid just looking on the older brother is teasing him with his food i have a sandwich and you get left overs haha and the dad is too busy on his phone to really care i know this isnt child abuse and i dont know their lives and stories but damnthat was cold edit i really enjoyed reading the comments and seeing others opinions on this i wouldnt consider this so much abuse but really strict parenting that i personally would feel horrible doing no there really wasnt anything i could do but give a im judging you glare he is still feeding his kid as far as i know although he is making him feel like shit in the process edit yes i get it i was a scumbag for not giving the kid a free sandwich you all can stop pming me about it now edit til redditors have strong opinions on parenting
i used to work at a gas station and like with most retail jobs i had my fair share of rude customers i was behind the register talking to a friend whod popped in to say hi when a customer approached the front counter okay cool just needed to be rung up standard stuff the customer was a lady who looked to be in her late s she had no makeup on that id noticed was modestly dressed and her hair was drawn tight into a ponytail at the nape of her neck pretty typical looking woman for the small conservative town i worked in i guess this is where i should mention that i was wearing red lipstick that night as i did during many of my shifts i looooove me some red lipstick i made some friendly small talk but throughout the entire transaction this lady was silent and she was staring at my mouth i got weird vibes that she was angry about something but i didnt ask why i went to hand her the grocery bag and told her to have a good night i dont like your lipstick her response snapped out of her mouth like shed been trying to hold it in but just couldnt do it anymore what your lipstick its too dark i dont like it i kind of froze not sure how to respond to her unsolicited critique of my makeup did she really think that her opinion about my lipstick was so important that she had to share it when i dont know what to say i just smile so i did that she tried to backtrack saying that red just didnt look good on me but i just kept smiling the more she spoke the wider my smile got my friend who had been watching the entire time tried to stifle his laughter and failed miserably i think that was the moment when she realized how completely inappropriate she was being and hightailed it out of there i still get annoyed when i think of that interaction i wear lipstick for myself not to cater to your specific tastes lady people can be so selfabsorbed i swear
hey tfr i just saw this happen last night so i work customer service at a wholesale club in the us for those unfamiliar with wholesale clubs you purchase a years membership and get all your info recorded in our database its no secret as we ask for your license and all the particulars when you sign up when you check out you need your membership card so naturally all your purchases are recorded no matter which club you use it at last night im manning the desk when my supervisor who is about my age within a few years of twenty walks over to me gt hey uh lancecorporalawesome what do we do when we suspect credit card fraud gti dont know get a manager i guess why gt that guy at selfcheckout is trying to use like ten credit cards over there gt shit really i look over and see this guy with bigass dreads and earbuds in getting frustrated with the card machine because it keeps declining his cards my supervisor radios the manager asking him to come to the supervisor counter our manager comes over and my supervisor alerts him to the situation this whole time dreadlocks guys light is flashing because his payment keeps getting declined my manager goes over to him and helps him out mainly as an excuse to get a closer look without attracting the guys suspicion surprisingly the guy didnt even seem nervous about my manager being right there the whole time he just kept right on going eventually the guy left we immediately go over and reprint his receipt and find that lo and behold the guy left his cart behind with some stuff in it apparently he had tried to break it up into several transactions and gave up on the latest one we look inside the cart and see two packs of plugin air fresheners and a rug hidden underneath the rug were a itunes gift card a google play gift card and nine visa gift cards worth each i dont remember how much he had already succeeded in loading up and making off with now heres the good part using his receipt the manager pulled up his membership last year the guy spent maybe this year he spent just shy of he looked up his purchase history and we saw hundreds of visa gift cards purchased in clubs in several states and even the occasional batch of groceries it was insane i dont know what happens next and i likely wont find out but if i do ill update you guys tldr guy uses stolen credit cards also uses membership card with all his personal information on it edit one missing word and replaced nectar with because autocorrect sometimes
background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square foot of fireworks heaven ive posted a few other stories if youre interested story i think because of the type of business i have a fireworks tent in a parking lot that people who come to shop just assume that they can wheel and deal to get a better price theyre right i own the place i set the prices and i get to make the rules we always try to throw in something extra for our customers where im from in louisiana its known as lagniappe which means a little something extra its kind of like a bakers dozen instead of if you come in with a great attitude pick out your stuff and are friendly to my staff im going to make sure you leave happy i love the customers that come in and try to get a deal by telling us that they know the owner you would not believe how often this happens my standard response when someone tells me this is them im supposed to get a discount i know the owner me great if you can just have him give me a call we can go ahead and give you the standard discount if were slow my other favorite scenario is to tell them that well check the comp list to see if theyre supposed to get their stuff for free ill then periodically yell out and randomly ask each employee if theyve seen the comp list while obviously making no attempt to look myself most of my employees are in on the joke and will just say no or claim they saw some other employee looking at it the credit for the best response goes to my good friend steven who kindly takes a few days off from his real job to help me out when im really busy when hes helping i think of him as another manager i trust his judgment and if he wants to give a discount or step in and take care of an issue more power to him steven had been helping out a problem shopper and the guy had really worn him out id been helping out other people but id seen steven going round and round with this guy typical entitled angry shopper eas steven is showing him around and explaining what everything does meanwhile the guy is basically berating steven the entire time he doesnt like the stuff we have our prices are too expensive he can get a better deal down the road it goes on and on the guy finally gets up to the counter to check out and steven goes off to help someone else after a few minutes the cashier calls steven back to the counter steven had already given the guy a couple of free things to try and make him happy but the eas is now demanding a discount on his entire purchase im standing about feet away helping another customer when i stop and look over just in time to catch this exchange eas im supposed to get a discount i know the owner steven you do you must be the guy he called me about eas yes steven he said that you were an asshole and that i should charge you double for whatever you wanted steven turned around and walked away eas angrily paid and stormed out of the tent and i turned and went right back to helping my customer who was now laughing her ass off gtbonus responses from my single days gt gta selection of some of my responses when it was a beautiful woman claiming they knew the owner to get a discount gt gtme hello im the owner have you ever considered marrying for money gt gtme i hear the owner is a fastastic guy are you going out with him would you like to be gt gtme hello im the owner would you like to discuss your discount over coffee gt gtme the owner told me we were only allowed to give discounts if the woman was topless gt gtme im sorry im the owner but i dont remember you did we sleep together 
in our stores range we have seasonal goods which at this time of year is mostly travel goods suitcases luggage tags luggage scales and the like the suitcases generally come in sizes from the smallest carryon ones right up to an enormous family sized case usually people only buy one or two of these at a time this day a lady came in and i was stood at the end of an aisle tidying she asked me where the suitcases were and i told her so she went off by the time she returned to pay i was back at my till and she came over now generally if people are buying suitcases i like to ask if theyre planning a trip anywhere nice its that time of year the lady was buying an entire set of suitcases so i assumed it was a long trip somewhere her answer was tragic she explained that her husband of almost years had developed dementia and it had reached a point where he didnt even recognise her or any family members and could barely remember things he did hours previously so she was making arrangements for him to go into permanent care so he could receive the best care he needed i honestly didnt know what to say at that point

hello again tfr i posted a a couple of days ago from my time working at a deli while some crazy things happened every now and then this is by far the craziest thing that has every happened to me while working there please bear with me as this will be a little long this particular day i was working a double shift as a delivery driver it was a couple of hours until my first shift ended and two deliveries got called in one delivery was pretty close to our location and the other was a little farther but still a pretty short drive easy i think to myself ill take the farther one and drop of the closer one on the way back i came to find out that im glad i made that decision everything goes relatively smoothly i drop off the first one arrive at the second and knock on the door i immediately hear what sounds like a small child yelling mooooommm heeellllpp no biggie i think some kid was horseplaying and probably fell down im sure their mom will be here shortly and answer the door so i wait and wait and wait some more i knock again and the screaming picks back up wait a minute or two the screaming subsides knock again the screaming picks up my mind starts to race surely the mom will be here right did she fall asleep is she even there by now every time i knock the screaming gets more and more desperate like someone is in some serious pain i even tried opening the door but it was locked i mull it over in my head a bit and finally decide on what i need to do ill call even if it isnt an emergency at least i can have the peace of mind that it wasnt anything bad as an aside ive hardly ever called so i was extremely nervous and it took a lot to convince myself to call i call the dispatcher and tell them whats going on i tell them that theres what sounds like a child yelling in this house and they inform me that theres a unit close by whos on the way within seconds a police cruiser comes down the road he comes up and i tell him what i told the dispatcher he knocks and hears the screaming tries to get into the house but no avail so he goes around to the back by this point a second cop shows up and a third the first cop comes back to the front and tells me that he was able to speak to the person screaming through the back door turns out it was an older lady not a kid like i thought shortly after he tells me this a fire truck and an ambulance come blaring down the road fuck this might be pretty bad even worse was the fact that i parked in the driveway of this house and the ambulance blocked me in forcing me to stay the firemen rush up to the door and bust it down the paramedics rushed in after them along with the cops so now im outside by myself waiting for them to finish whatever it is theyre doing so i can finally leave and get back to work the entire time im worried that something is seriously wrong and felt helpless throughout the whole thing finally the paramedics come out with someone on a stretcher and load them up into the ambulance one of the cops comes up to me and informs me that the lady living in this house recently has hip surgery and while she was walking around the house she somehow displaced her hip leaving her immobile and in a lot of pain he told me it was a good thing i called since she had been there for a while and who knows how much longer she could have been stuck there he gives me a congratulatory pat on the back everyone loads up and leaves and i finally make my way back to the deli i get there cash out and go on my much needed break epilogue later on during the night shift the husband of the woman came in to pick up the food from earlier as my coworker was helping him she pointed me out as the one who called youre the one who did that yes sir i was really worried that something serious happened he beams at me shakes my hand while thanking me profusely and hands me a few bucks for the trouble in all honesty he didnt even have to tip me just his face and reaction was a good enough tip for me 
a customer comes up to the fitting room with me asking about three leggings she found in the clearance section two of them were marked down for while the other was still full price at i knew where this was going to go because it has happened before a manager comes up listens to the customer and then makes the customer happy by taking the price down of that one to match the others a miracle among miracles this didnt happen i called for a manager one of them told me to tell the customer yadda yadda i told them i already told the customer that and they still want to speak with a manager one of the co managers shows up and listens to the customer while doing this she also looks over the items and notices the upcs are very different because they are from different series from the manufacturer she tells this to the customer and that therefore it isnt discounted customer tried to argue but was still shutdown i stood there in disbelief i couldnt believe i heard that the co manager walked away leaving me to deal with the customer again she was pissed and asked for the corporate number i gave her the number sure enough within minutes corporate called and i forwarded them to management the conversation between managers over the walkie was yadda yadda store discretion and it isnt going to happen and also something about the lady sitting in the parking lot i had myself a little giggle saw my meal break replacement shows up so i went to dinner i had me some wings and a oz soda have a great day edit i made it to the front page thanks to everyone
this happened to me in my first job and i still to this day dont understand how the customer settled for my suggestion i used to work in a chain of stores that sold baskin and robbins ice cream if youve never tasted baskin and robbins it is literally the best ice cream youre going to get the price was fairly expensive but compared to other brands like ben and jerrys it was considerably cheaper even more so if ive scooped it for you as i always overscooped at the time we had this offer on for a cherry milkshake which was usually there were signs clearly posted which just said something along the lines of try our cherry milkshake exclusive offer so a guy comes to my counter and orders a cotton candy milkshake he pays and goes and sits in our seating area everything is fine with the world minutes later he comes back with this half drunk milkshake and slams it on the counter and clicks at me to get my attention customer i paid for this milkshake and that sign there says theyre me were having an offer our new cherry flavour ice cream the special off price is only available for the cherry ice cream unfortunately customer i dont like cherry and well i feel like ive been ripped off what are you going to do to resolve it cant you make my milkshake me im sorry you feel that way but unfortunately its only the cherry ice cream which is what would you suggest customer i want a milkshake for me well i will be happy to make you a cherry milkshake for and i can offer you a discount on a box of cookies as well this guys face turns so smug he agrees and pays for his items then leaves with another milkshake and a box of cookies spending an additional so all in all he paid for items he didnt actually want i wonder how long it took him to realise what he had done sir youve just been served by the best my friend 
i used to work in telco sales management for a random mvno one day we had a customer return to us complaining about a large bill that she had received telling us that she doesnt use her phone enough to rack up the bill being a good manager i sat down with her to go through the bill to determine where the issue is at the time data services had become a big thing and i assumed thats where it would be coming from nope the lady had a list of thousands of sms sent in a single month gtme well it looks as though youve been sending more text messages than you normally would gtcustomer no that cant be right i didnt send these messages im being charged twice for every message gtme i see those they are because youve asked for proof that each message has been received but none of those are charged on your bill the problem is related to the thousands of text messages that were sent gt customer i didnt send these messages i want to be refunded for this ive never spent so much on a phone bill in my life i spent two hours with her going through each message on the bill finding the number they were sent to and matching it up with the messages on her phone it wasnt until i had gone through every single sms and proved to her that she had sent each message that she admitted that her usage for the month was higher than normal at that point she stormed out without so much as a thank you and then i just shake my head and move on to the next customer

i run a small photolab for an independent pharmacy its a sweet job both challenging and satisfying and the customers are generally very nice and grateful so a couple weeks ago this young lady stops by clearly upset apparently she went to a certain national electronics store for passport photos she ended up buying two sets from them in the first set she didnt like how they looked but they wouldnt provide a free reshoot which ill gladly do so she pays for it the nd time she was satisfied with how she looked but the passport lady at the post office said they would be rejected by the feds for several reasons she went in to get a refund and they said oh shes just being picky we wont give you a refund for this how dumb is that her job is ensuring that passports are accepted by the feds of course shell maintain high standards thats her fucking job plus i saw the photos in question i cant believe they would let those photos go out the door so thats bucks shes not getting back for a service that was never properly rendered ended up taking her passport photo and giving it to her for free cause thats ridiculous she ended up writing a great review for the lab online i hope the other guys continue to do the same work cause i love taking their business edit formatting edit ahhhhhh i drank some beer and went into deepstasis only to wake up to lovely comments and delicious karma thanks for making my day guys imma try to answer some of these questions now edit here is what my brother said in regards to the what happened to the guy who got a refund in pennies yes he did it was pennies pounds of them guy who got refund rolled them and took them to the bank captain of ship and i tried to get him to give them to a friend to buy something from national chain and pay in pennies guy who got refund is banned from the premise i also know the refund wasnt rendered till a couple months later so i have a feeling that guywhogotrefund was pretty sick of it in the end
i work in a small video game store had a family of three come in last night mom two kids one of the kids was shopping the other was sick to his stomach he walked around the store puked at least different times all over the floor and the mom did not even bat an eyelash after puke she took him out of the store to put him into the car then came back in to shop with the other kid she did not apologize and then we had to close the entire store for a few hours while we cleaned up the nastiest little kid vomit in the world psa to parents i dont really care if your kid is sick though i prefer that he isnt but if im going to spend three hours of my life cleaning up his bodily fluids least you can do is act like youre sorry about it

this story happened tonight at the time it boiled my blood and pissed me off now i just pity this guy so much so i work at the front desk of a nice hotel am a supervisor and am competent enough to be the manager on duty each of my shifts so i am working tonight the night isnt terribly difficult training a new employee high amount of guests checking in an older gentleman comes to the front desk and asks for change for a he specifies that he needs in dollars and the remaining in coins i comply and he asks for the closest pay phone i direct him to one in the lobby and can tell this isnt going to end well the gentleman comes back a minute later saying the pay phone did not work and he wants his money back i tell him that directions are on the pay phone to request a refund and sadly we were not responsible for a refund since this a third party service he asks me to come assist him with attempting to get his refund i tell him to dial the refund line and to request a refund this is where he loses his cool and begins to spout off that he is old and needs help i calmly ask him to please calm down and to tell me the story he says he deposited made his call and the phone rang and went to voicemail i tell him okay well did you record a message he answers yes he did but the call wasnt picked up i tell him well it was picked up by the voice mail service and i am sorry that he was not connected to a human being but got a voice mail service this infuriates him and he starts yelling i tell him okay i will navigate the menu prompts i navigate the menu and finally get to the last stage of the menu where the phone company will review the issue and if it is machine error they will mail a check for a whole anywhere in the world the guy loses his cool and yells that they will not send a check to china for him i tell him that they said it will be mailed and to please record his name and mailing address he goes bananas and says why cant he just get his refund i tell him this is the way this company handles refunds and that we are not liable for refunds now the pay phone message system shuts down and no message was recorded the pay phone shuts down and will not be back up and running until a technician resets it and makes sure it is in working order the guy loses it saying why is this so difficult i tell him it is not difficult and to calm down he goes off how the machine is in our hotel that we should bear some of the burden i ask him okay our atm is in the building if it dispenses you incorrect amounts are we liable for the machine he says well no you arent i tell him exactly it is in our building but it is not our responsibility for a malfunction i tell him sir you left a voice mail you wanted to talk your party but they did not pick up so please calm down he pleads and begs for his money back i ask him if he was going to starve without this he says no i ask him if this is his last i ask him if this will ruin his finances he answers no to every question i open my wallet and retrieve two crisp dollar bills and tell him this wont ruin me either i hand him the dollars and ask for the fifty cents this guy looks like a ghost i shove the in his hands hold my hand out and he drops the two quarters into my hand i ask him if he is happy he nods silently i tell him great now please realize i will not be reimbursed for this but this will not matter to me in a year month day or hour so why let it get you down why let it affect you to make you yell act uncivil or ruin your day he says nothing at all i tell him well you got your refund the phone is locked out of service and you cannot use the phone at all so have a good night he walks away realizing how big of an ass he was all of this for making one person realize how petty they were for is priceless update so the guest who is still staying at the hotel came up to me last night and said one of the most gratifying things ever i am sorry i acted that way it was petty to be angry over something so small would you like your money back i told him dont worry about it shook his hand and left it at that with a smile maybe i changed his thinking that night who knows
so i was working another night shift at a little sandwich shop inside of a gas station i had been quiet for a while after the lunch rush was over when a young couple came in i made their sandwiches without incident they spent most of the time talking to each other instead of paying attention to the food but thats pretty normal i wrap everything up and start punching in the register i give them their total and the girl tries to pay exact giving me some bills and change i count all of the money and she is fifty cents short she opens her wallet again but it is empty then she looks at my tip jar next to the register working in a gas station with a tip jar we get exactly as much crap happening to it as youd expect we never make much maybe an extra five to ten bucks a night but its a good pick me up about once a week our less savory customers take out of it when we arent looking but thats probably the worst so when this girl locked eyes on the quarters in the bottom of my jar and tried to reach for them i was pretty mentally prepared to tell her that she cannot take from my tip jar and give her the quarters i usually use the spare change to help people who are legitimately short anyway but then another hand came down and slapped hers out of the way i look back up and her boyfriend is looking at her with shock bitch this is a goddamn tip jar not a change jar show some respect he looks back at me thanks me hands me two bucks grabs the food and walks away with his girlfriend in tow 
background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square foot of fireworks heaven story we offer an unconditional no dud guarantee on everything we sell basically if it doesnt work bring it back and well replace it or give you your money back we occasionally have items returned but it doesnt happen very often the morning after nye one of our regulars showed up for a return he was moving pretty slow and was nursing an obvious hangover he wanted to return our firecracker roll because it was a dud he was pretty bummed since this was supposed to be the big midnight finale at his friends house i was immediately confused since i have no idea how firecrackers could have all been bad i told him we would take care of it and asked him if it had gotten wet he told me that it just wouldnt light no matter how hard they tried and it was in the back of his car if we wanted to check it out now this particular roll is packaged to look like a giant firecracker with a piece of rope coming out of the top to simulate a fuse like at the base of the rope are pictures and written directions explaining how to unwrap the package to get to the real fuse you can then roll it out so the firecrackers go off individually or light it as a bundle with all firecrackers going off in about a minute to prove his point he pulled out his phone to show my dad and i a video they had taken of him trying to light it in the video he was obviously loaded and was stumbling around with a lighter trying to light the piece of green rope i could hear people laughing in the background and egging him on as they had filmed him trying to drunkenly light a piece of rope for minutes as were watching the video im dying inside and trying to think of a nice way to tell him what his mistake was suddenly he paused the video slowly looked up at us and said cust thats not really the fuse is it me starting to chuckle nope cust those bastards me dying laughing now look ill give you your money back and give you another one for free if youll send me that video i think he considered it for a second but then he figured out that i was definitely going to post the video on my website hell id have given him triple his money back for a copy of that video he quickly hit the delete button and shook his head no i tried to give him his money back but he wouldnt accept it he asked us to check out the firecracker roll in his car to make sure it was still good and my dad walked out to check on it with him my dad was laughing when he walked back into the tent and let me in on the joke after my dad had peeled back the paper and showed the guy where the real fuse was the guy thanked my dad and casually mentioned his plans he was now on his way to buy a big metal garbage can and then planned to stop by his friends house to say good morning
this one just happened on mobileforgive formatting so im waiting in line at my favorite coffee place for my daily dose of caffeine its semibusy at this time of morning when the brekkie rush is just ending so im the last person in a fairly short line refill guy comes up bypasses the line and demands the cashier still helping another customer refill his tiny little coffee cashier tells him that store policy is that he cant cut the line he needs to wait like everyone else and to please return to the end of the line refill guy gets really angry at this point starts yelling that he has never had to wait before ever and that this isnt their corporate policy cashier explains very patiently that they are privately owned and that the owner prefers that everyone go through the line to make things fair for all customers refill guy reluctantly takes his place in line behind me grumbling about how unfair it is how hes going to demand a manager who was actually standing behind cashier filling orders when she told the customer to wait in line in the first place and so on getting himself really worked up in the short wait in line it looked like it took a lot of the wind out of his sails when he finally got his turn to get his precious refill and ended up at the same cashier who politely served him as though he hadnt been a complete a a few seconds ago silently took his refill and slunk back into the table area to nurse his ire

original post i got a phone call this afternoon around of the clock from my account manager telling me that i needed to report to the district office immediately so i rolled out of bed showered shaved put clothes on and drove off into the city i was greeted at the secretarys desk by the manager and told to follow him into the district managers dm from here on office where dm was waiting for me with a stack of paperwork fuck my life i bet this is gents doing i thought to myself i stuck out my hand to shake dms hand and he rather rudely refused barking at me to sit down i bit my tongue and complied im going to get straight to the point keiblerclown we received two seperate phone calls from members at coastal yacht club about an incident several nights ago in which you were reported as being rude obnoxious and confrontational to a mr gent this type of behavior violates global security companys code of conduct and we have zero tolerance for it do you have anything to say in your defense before you receive your disciplinary hearing my jaw bounced off dms desk on its way to the floor this couldnt be fucking happening i wiped the sudden sweat from my brow and said i did have an encounter with a mr gent several nights ago but it didnt happen the way you just described it mr gent was the rude obnoxious and confrontational one id go as far as to say he was entirely belligerent and i have no clue who this second person is supposed to be because mr gent was alone during ourencounter well keiblerclown thats a nice story but its your word against two actually i do have a witness who will corroborate that mr gent was both alone and belligerent her name is dont lie to me i know damn well you work alone on an overnight shift it was st patricks day and the club was hosting a party later than they normally close i placed a phone call from my office to the business office and spoke to barbara the event manager who heard mr gent go off on a diatribe im fairly certain that she can verify whether or not he was alone or not as well actually mr gent would have been seen on camera coming to and leaving my office they can check the footage dm was silent for a moment before asking my manager to sit in and watch me what the actual fuck while he stepped out to make some phone calls roughly minutes pass in terribly awkward silence before dm comes back in and immediately apologizes for the misunderstanding apparently barbara had not only corroborated my story but several other employees throughout that night had reported gents jackassery he had actually been with a guest the same in fact who had made the second complaint against me but that guest had left roughly an hour before my shift had even started the best part is that the general manager at the yacht club will begin processing the paperwork to revoke gents membership and will be forwarding it to every other club they are affiliated with justice the grouchy bastard damn near had me but it was my helpful phone call to barbara that saved my ass in the end i need to buy her dinner or something holy shucking fit tldr gent attempts to fuck me over ends up fucking himself over even harder edit i should proof read before posting
thank you for shopping at hypermarket kindly go die in a fire all my fellow retail workers know the glorious feeling that accompanies a jackass customer being slapped down whether you yourself get to deliver the coup de grace to their ego or you merely watch someone else do it there are few things quite as satisfying as bearing witness to a righteous verbal smackdown against an odious customer come step aboard the wayback machine and i will take you back to such an event in the faroff days of it was an average day in my little kingdom of uscan until royal jerkface called me over for help he had a coupon and it wasnt scanning the following conversation is an approximation of what i can remember since this happened almost six years ago his final line though is accurate as is what follows that me oh well these machines dont actually scan the coupons sir i have to do that for you rj well thats fucking stupid me internal sigh just let me take that coupon for you sir and ill get this taken care of he handed me the coupon and i felt myself die a little inside it was expired by over a month me im terribly sorry sir but this coupon is expired im afraid i cant take it rj what thats bullshit ive used these coupons here before me yes but this one is expired its no good anymore rj whatever just give me my money off me im sorry but i cant rj yes you can you have to me no sir i really cant company policy does not allow us to accept expired coupons rj this is crap i know you can take this its your job do your job and do it right you vapid cnt i was stunned nobody have ever actually called me such a thing before and to have that particularly vile word hurled at me over a fiftycent coupon caught me so offguard that my mind went completely blank i could think of no way to respond fortunately i didnt have to during my exchange with royal jerkface i hadnt noticed the customer that sidled up to the next machine waiting for me to finish up with jerkface it was my big brother my big brother is not my big brother just because hes older than me he is has broad shoulders and at that time had just come home from a summer spent working as a wildland firefighter so he was in quite good shape hes also somewhat comically protective of me before the snap of the t at the end of the offending word had finished echoing off the uscan machines my brother had closed the distance between himself and rj he clamped a hand down on rjs shoulder spun him around leaned down to rjs eye level rj was significantly shorter than him and snarled what did you just say to my little sister rj went white his face had been the scarlet of a person so angry you fear or hope they may burst an important vessel somewhere but one look into my brothers eyes and the color just drained out of him he stood for a moment staring at my brother in abject fear his mouth opening and closing but producing no soundand then he turned and sprinted out of the store at that point i laughed so hard that i cried it was glorious it was the most perfect thing i had ever seen and as a bonus neither hide nor hair of rj was ever seen in the store again tldr do not taunt happy fun brother
this actually happened over the course of two weeks but anyway the shop i work in has among other things a selection of furniture now we dont have a huge amount of space so we often have to order things and especially for the largest items it also means that customers can have things homedelivered if they buy in store we have no delivery service so they have to transport items themselves two weeks or so ago an elderly lady came in and asked about furniture we didnt have the item in stock so i suggested that she could place an order online i asked her if shed like it if we did via the stores order system or whether shed like to set up an online account it went something like this gtme ok we can do this two ways i can put the order through our internal system or you can create your own account here now so you can order things at home yourself gtcomputer lady oh im a bit unsure about computers gtme dont worry its very easy to do in fact we can both sit at the computer and ill guide you through the whole thing im really good with computers myself so i can assure you that nothing will go wrong plus if you can do this you can do any shopping online theyre all pretty similar she seemed happy with this so off we went to the back room where the customer computer was now what i did in this case was rather than doing all the inputting myself i got this lady to do it herself with me explaining everything to her in a sort of eli way it took a few minutes to create an account and then i showed her how to place and pay for an order before printing the confirmation and writing it in the order book she then went off pleased with everything skip forward to today and said lady came in again doing more shopping she came to my till and obviously recognised me and said gtlady oh you showed me about shopping online you know after youd explained it to me like you did i went home and gave it a shot and you were right it was easy my granddaughter thinks im great because i bought her birthday present online and i even managed to work out how to send it straight to her house so yes i introduced an elderly customer to online shopping and made her day hijabedit thank you for the gold
so this just happened mins ago and i still dont know what went through that ladys head i work in a stall in the middle of a hallway in a mall so we have no gate and no external signs of being closed but for the fact that all the lights are off a sign that explicitly states we are closed and our opening hours and that all the other stores around are obviously closed we open at on saturdays now when i got to my stall this morning it was around largely enough time for me to turn on the registers and do everything i needed to do for the stall to open at a lady was sitting on the bench in front of the stall tapping her foot i didnt worry about her since a lot of people sit there waiting for the bigger stores around us to open however as soon as i entered my stall she jumped up and came to me excuse me miss youre late i knew i wasnt but i still looked at my watch im sorry maam but we dont open until no youre late still halfasleep i somehow wondered if she was right i checked my watch again ok at least i knew i wasnt crazy im sorry maam but as i told you we open at i would be happy to help you then this is unacceptable you are late and you wont even admit it as you can see maam it is only i showed her my watch but it did nothing to cool the fury of this righteous customer lady but youre late you have to be there when i arrive you have to open right away when i arrive i could only stare at her it was way too early in the morning to explain basic rules of retail to a lady well in her fourties she embarked upon the usual rant of this is horrible customer service ill never come back here etc etc before finally leaving it is now and im not sure if she will come back today edit it is currently and she has just left the stall no she did not actually buy whatever it was she wanted to buy this morning but only wanted to tell me how much of a terrible person i am and how i shouldnt be allowed to work i cant say i expected much more
i went to visit my dad today he wanted me to bring my dog so he could hang out with her for a couple of hours while i got my hair done and ran a couple of errands when i got back he asked me if i remember telling him about how crappy my day was at work at my old job and i would sometimes get a tip from a customer which would cheer me up gtme sure i remember gtdad i think youll be proud of me i went to get lunch at chicken place he goes to often and there was a new girl working the front the people in front of me had a really big order and they were making the order really confusing for her she asked her coworkers for help but they ignored her or told her shes gotta be able to figure it out on her own she kinda reminded me of you when you were younger and she looked like she was about to cry she ended up getting the order for them done and when it was my turn i told her she did a good job getting my meal for me and i tipped her gtme oh cool yeah that was really nice of you could you tell it brightened her day gtdad yeah she was really surprised it made my cold retail heart a little less icy today itll be back tomorrow i already got two emails about a customer with a cluster of an issue to fix just thought id share
been working as a shift manager at a retail store for about a year now recently moved across the country and transferred stores this happened a couple weeks into my time at the new store a young girl probably comes in with her mother she says she left her wallet in the bathroom and asks if any have been turned in i tell her nothing has been turned in but i take her phone number so that if it shows up i can give her a call she and her mom search around the store for it to no avail then a fellow shopper suggests they look in the trash for it they come to me and ask me to look for it in the trash can outside not my favorite task in the world but she seems pretty upset so i get some gloves and start digging what do you know i actually find the wallet very pleased with myself i bring it to her but she opens it up and all her money is gone i mean it was in the trash obviously someone else found it first this is where it got weird gther there was like in here though gtme yea im sorry to hear that i wish i could help more gther well can i at least get my money back gtme nowe didnt lose your wallet you did gther mom but she forgot it at your store gtme unfortunately there is nothing i can do i cant give you money because your daughter lost track of her own money gther mom well that is ridiculous we are going to call corporate on you somebody is responsible for this gtme i agree your daughter is responsible for this gther mom you will be hearing from us then they stormed out of the store never to be seen or heard from again
this happened a few years ago while i was working in the electronics department at a big box retailer this guy and his girlfriend both around years old comes up to me and say they want to buy a few things including a inch tv and were wondering if we took checks the dude straight up hands me his checkbook and without even needing to put a detective hat on i could tell it was stolen both the routing number and account number were lazily altered with a pen and they had crossed off the persons address at the top i was not much older than either of them so my first thought is they are trying to get me to go along with their scheme being that i dont know these people and have zero reason to help them with crime i decide to play along i let them know that we absolutely take checks as long as one of them has a valid id i excuse myself to the back explaining that i need to see if we have the tv they wanted in stock and they should have a look around to see if there was anything else they wanted to buy while i checked at the time i had zero sympathy for these people they were both dressed like their families were welloff this store was in one of the more wealthy suburbs and the whole thing seemed like they felt so entitled they were just going to steal from someone to get whatever they wanted i head to the back and immediately call an assistant manager and let them know whats going on he says try and stall them for a few minutes get them everything they want and when they are ready to check out make some excuse about needing to bring them up to the front registers i bring the tv out on a cart and find they have decided i seem cool and was going to let them use a stolen check so they now want a load of random crap dvds surround system etc i spend something like minutes with them going over the differences in all the console gaming systems have them look at laptops cameras and all kinds of other junk they are excited by all the stuff they are going to buy and after filling a shopping cart they are ready to check out we get to the front check out and the assistant manager has put on a cashiers vest and is waiting at a closed check out line for us i steer us to his line and he starts ringing everybody up he gets to the total which i think was somewhere in the range they write a check and he asks for id the girlfriend hands over a license with a year old womans picture on it but with the same name as on the check without missing a beat the assistant waives over three police officers who were standing at the entrance waiting for these two kids and arrest them they were planning on grabbing them either way since they were reported as being in possession of stolen checks because of these two i spent the rest of the evening writing up a detailed itemization of everything they were trying to purchase for the police report i never found out what happened to them but i assume they were charged with a crime of some kind they didnt seem to realize what was going on when i had someone else check them out and were totally blindsided when the police came up to arrest them i know i could have probably just told them we cant accept their check when they first came up to me or maybe had a little chat with them about not committing crimes thinking back though even if i declined their attempt to use a fraudulent check they would have probably just tried the same thing somewhere else and who knows whether this was actually the first time they tried it i do feel a little bad helping them dig their own hole but at the end of the day i just dont think its cool to go up to a stranger at their job and expect them to help you with crime its pretty fucking rude 
i was working a solo shift at the convenience store and a regular stopped in we chatted for a few minutes and she asked for some items gatorade water sandwich and bananas to be put in a separate bag which i soon found out was for one of the homeless people that regularly hung around the store after the customer left and gave the guy the bag he waited until she left and came into the store this exchange ensued gt me may i help you gt him in a sincere tone yes the woman that just left gave me this bag of items and i would like to return them gt me are there any issues with what you received im thinking along the lines of different flavors of gatorade or another type of sandwich gt him yes i want to return them for the cash so i can get beer instead at this i cocked my head to the side and pretended to think about it gt me no i cant refund the money to you because you didnt originally purchase these items gt him im being honest doesnt that count for something gt me not in this case because she bought these so you can have them not for you to turn back in for cash he leaves in an angry huff and tosses the bag against the window as he departs i go outside to retrieve the bag and give it to one of the other homeless regulars that came in later that day that was appreciative for the sustenance tldr homeless person wants to return food items purchased by another customer so he can have cash for booze edit just got home from work and reading through the thread thank you kind stranger for my first gilded post

i work in a deli inside a supermarket and its not uncommon for customers to call ahead to place an order on sandwiches especially if its a large order unfortunately its less common than people just strolling in and asking for the order to be made in front of them on no notice but thats another story i had just gotten to work at am as my coworker left for lunch my manager went to the back freezer so i was alone for a bit up comes this lady in scrubs who greets me politely enough gtwoman hello im here to pick up an order for sandwiches gtme okay one second let me find that for you nobody told me about this order and it could be hiding in one of several places i check the sandwich barnot there not weird considering the amount i check the quickchill fridgenot there either hmm i check the walkin fridgenope uh oh where the hell are all these sandwiches i start freaking out ive been yelled at by customers who havent had their orders ready im sure you have too its not fun im not really in the mood for a good ol screamfest i apologize to the woman and tell her ill call my manager surely shell know where they are i go to call over the intercom for my manager to come back to the deli and as im picking up the phone the woman starts laughing like cracking up luckily for me i paused and let her speak before i make the call gtim just messing with you theres no sandwiches you just looked like you would fall for that i hang up the phone completely stunned nerves still racing from the fear of being screamed at who the hell thinks thats funny in what way is that funny what kind of maniac are you to get me all worked up and worried about that what tipped you off that i would fall for that the fact that im fucking working and thats my fucking job of course i didnt scream that in her face as much as i wanted to i just asked her gtme can i get you anything gtwoman no thanks you dont hold grudges do you 
i have plenty of horrible stories but i figured id start my first post with a positive one warning if you for some reason hate kids and everything they do even nicecute ones you probably wont enjoy this story at my shoe store we have tablets where we can check people out look at our website order shoes for them etc usually there are one or two associates on the floor with those tablets helping people out with those things on this day i was working in womens with the tablet a women and her two kids a boy about aged and a girl aged enter our store from the elevator the first thing i noticed were that the kids were on scooters which was actually pretty cute they just cruised slowly behind their mom and werent causing any trouble i went over to ask the mother if she needed any help and it turns out the family was english and had accents which as an american is always unnecessarily exciting for me the kids also had accents which was adorable im helping out the mother and using the tablet to look something up for her as im doing this the boy comes over and tries to see what im doing i bent down to show him what i was doing and talked through it he watched with way more fascination than i would ever expect its really not an interesting process and politely waited for me to finish what i was doing after i let the mom know about her shoes the boy asks if he can see the tablet again and i show him the screen while im still holding it the conversation went as follows the words arent exact but the content is the same i will be me and the kid will be b reminder this kid has a posh little english accent gtb how go i get out of this referring to the program i was using to look up shoes gtme exits program like this gtb where are your games gtme im sorry bud but i dont have any games on here he looks at me with genuine concern like he seemed really worried for me gtb they dont let you have games what do you do gtme i have to work and help people my boss wouldnt like it if i was playing games all day gtb what about toys gtme no i dont get any toys either gtb he touches my arm like a parent would to a child im so sorry at this point the mom was finished shopping and started taking the kids to leave as theyre getting ready to leave the boy says to me i hope they let you have some fun this interaction really made my day ive had kids before try and play games on my tablet but id never had any of them feel bad for me when i told them i dont have any it was hilarious and adorable

i worked at a grocery store at a full service meat counter this means if you wanted any type of meat steaks chicken fish etc not deli meats you had to get it from me behind a counter the kid started working in the meat department two years after i did he was a terrible employee right off the bat slacking off and messing around with the other part timers his age on his first day sometimes when it was a slow evening we in the meat department would take food that would be going bad the next day and cook it using the hot plates on our plastic wrapping stations the kid found out about this and started spending most of each shift cooking food that had just been made creating feasts for himself each day he worked he stole from the meat cooler before he would leave his shift he would pull what he called heists where he would cram as many cuts of meat as possible into a paper bag place it just outside the loading bay door before he left and then just drive to the back of the building to pick up his prize he had cookouts with the other delinquent kids with his obsconded beef store manager hated the kid with a passion but wanted to find a valid reason to fire him so there was no way he could come back this happened his second week on the job he was still learning the ropes on how to do things when the woman came in we knew who she was she was the mother of a kid in produce who frequented the shop all the time she held a personal grudge against the kids family though im not sure why she ordered teriyaki marinated beef sticks which the kid obliged to however instead of placing them in a tin container he wrapped them up in the deli paper we wrapped plain unmarinated meats in needless to say she wasnt happy when the teriyaki sauce leaked through to her car floor so store manager finally got to bring the kid into the front office and fire him like he always wanted the kid went home before he could start working his next shift a month later the meat department was paged with a phone call upon answering it was the kid asking for his job back i handed the phone off to meat manager who told the kid that in order to get his job back he would need to get approval from store manager something that was highly unlikely so the kid did the only thing he could think of he called the store every day not asking for his job back but asking for hours in the meat department he called every day for about two and a half weeks and always called when he knew store manager was out when store manager finally got all of his messages he got confused and mistook the kid as a college student coming back from a semester looking for hours so he called the kid back and left a voicemail saying he would tell meat manager to put him on the schedule as soon as the kid walked back in the store all of his old habits came with him the slacking off the heists the feasts all came back full force the feasts ended quickly however when he was caught by the deli manager who promptly informed meat manager i was told to cut the wires inside every hot plate to stop them from working ever again so nobody could make any food the slacking off stayed the same but the heists got worse he didnt just take items from the meat department anymore he began taking everything that wasnt nailed down in the store this shed light to some of his worse habits too he began taking medicines from the shelves this however would prove to be his downfall the medicine aisle was one of three areas in the entire store with an acutal working camera store manager wanted to catch the kid in the act before he could fire him again but knew the kid only stole things after he left so store manager snuck into his office one day and closed the door for an extended shift watching the cameras closely he waited for a sign of the kid to come down any aisle there was a camera in sure enough within minutes of store managers usual punch out he saw the kid slowly walking up and down the medicine aisle he was acting so nonchalantly nobody would have taken him for doing anything suspicious then with one swift movment he swiped two boxes of nyquil off the shelves and into the pocket of his meat jacket half an hour later the kid returned to the meat department from his rounds of socializing with his friends in the bakery he placed his meds on the chicken cutting table and started snacking on some candy he had taken earlier as he turned around to go out to the case he found himself staring at store manager gtstore manageryou pay for that nyquil gtthe kidi was going to pay for it when i left work today i have a cold and uh gtstore manageryoure stealing it i saw you on the cameras gtthe kidohreally shit gtstore managerget the fk out of my store if i ever see you again on these grounds ill have you escorted out of here by police the kid then went home and told me the whole story why was i at his house the kid is my younger brother
so this was from earlier in the summer in a beach town in new jersey a big part of my job was selling beach chairs this larger woman wearing a bikini and happens to look exactly like a year old snookie walks into our store with a young man by her side this guy was maybe years old and im sure they were a coupleor very very touchy family members this lady walks up to one of the middle of the line chairs and yells oh hell no i ask if she needs any help and she proceeds to yell at me because the chairs are too expensive i explain to her the differences in each chair and why one costs more than the other i tell her that my family has actually owned one from this company for years truth and she proceeds to call me a liar she then says get me that chair i want to try it i grab the chair we were talking about and place it on the ground she then snaps her fingers times right in front of my face and yells that she wanted to try this other chair after minutes of trying chairs more snapping and being called kid numerous times i finally convince her to buy the most expensive chair we have she tries it out and completely wipes out when trying to get upkarma she gets to the front counter and grabs a candy bar and quickly eats it her credit card is denied and she tries to leave but the lady behind the counter made her come back in and pay for the candy bar karma is a bitchand so was this lady

 we were having a nice busy evening and were a bit spread thin with only two of us working in walks the worlds dumbest criminal okay she was pretty slick she managed to get several items before slipping out the door with a thankyougoodnight before we even really noticed the apron was a good idea on her part as it concealed the items very well she had scoped the cameras pretty well too she missed the reflection that wasnt hidden from the camera but who wouldnt the fact that it was an apron from her work was a less good idea since there are only two of those places in our smallish town she is awaiting a court date edit missed a word 
i used to work at a gas station that was family owned and operated i was there for a year and the entire time the dress code was very lax i wore jeans with holes and rips in them short shorts whatever to top it off it was in an extremely nice area near a lake and the flocked to this place because it was the only convenience store nearest the lake for beersodacandy one day i came to work in jeans that were about years old they were so worn out that they used to be tight jeans but were baggy as hell and had rips on both knees yaaaay minimum wage the regulars there were quirky one came in just like he does every day and grabs a oz of busch as he gets to the counter i stop stocking sodas and meet him at the register hi how are you tod you are so stupid for buying those jeans like that im sorry what you have got to be kidding me you are so dumb so stupid i didnt buy my jeans like this ive had them for years and worn them a lot no you didnt you bought those jeans like that at this point im getting angry this rich bastard is insulting my intelligence because hes never seen what well worn clothes look like in his life no i didnt who the hell would buy jeans this jacked up the zipper is literally held together by a keyring he shakes his head designer jeans these days are so stupid i cant believe you bought those like that i was more confused than angry even still and a line had formed so i gave him his change and ignored him as i served the next customer he continued to stand next to the register for about minutes telling the influx of people how stupid i was for buying baggy unflattering jeans with holes at the knees and pockets most didnt care and ignored him but after one of my favorite regulars shrugged and told him looks like normal wear and tear to me he stomped out to his car and left that was years ago and im still confused 
a few years ago i worked at a local novelty shop as a sales person we sold various pop culture related novelty items from tv shows movies anime etc the crowd that this store drew was very broad and attracted some very interesting characters this story is about one of those characters we will call him pac and boy was this guy a character it was a slow day at the store and i was tidying up the displays when in walks pac me welcome to store let me know if you need anything pac completely ignores me and goes straight to our anime section i shrug it off and walk back to the register that was located in the center of the store and organize some of the stock behind the counter i could hear pac scoffing at all the mainstream anime we carried about minutes later pac approached the register most of the dialogue from pac is wordforword it just always stuck with me how ridiculous it all sounded pac i require service me hey how can i help you pac i was wondering if you had anything of obscure anime me uhh no we dont pac oh okay how about other obscure anime me no we dont carry that either a smug grin came onto pacs face and i knew exactly where this was going we had people like this come in all the time they didnt want to buy anything they just wanted to flex their pop culture tastes over a store that sold pop culture items pac tsk thats pretty sad you should get more stuff of previously mentioned animes they would sell like crazy me i would have to talk to my bosses about ordering that kind of stuff but i will let them know pac good i am the president of the local anime club i know what i am talking about i have a lot of pull in the anime world and people will come here if i say its good me uhhh okay i will let them know trying not to laugh at this point pac i am looking to buy something though please tell me you have slightly less obscure anime me yes actually we do his smug grin changed very quickly to almost a startled look i showed him the merchandise we had for that particular anime me let me know if any of this interests you pac err ahh no it doesnt goodbye pac then promptly left the store and i never saw him again unfortunately i think we never got his anime club recommendation tldr customer tried to flex his advanced anime knowledge on me and tell us what stock to buy showed him something he asked for that we actually had and he left the store

tldr at the bottom hi guys and gals sorry it took awhile to post another story it rained our new roof leaked and now theres water all in our walls and ceilings and floors its a whole to do but all of my business stuff is safe and dry and nothing was ruined so thats all that matters anyway to recap i own a small pet business where i hand make items and have resell items that i sell at events and vendor shows after years in retail i can tell you that these events bring out a different kind of crazy than good old regular brick and mortar store customers for the first two years i was in business i relied heavily on dog and cat treat sales for my business and didnt carry anything else when i first started out im licensed by the department of agriculture to sell them and all of my treats have been lab tested as such i am required to put all pertinent information on my labels such as the ingredients that theyre all natural to refrigerate them the fat and protein content etc the labels then have to be approved by the department of agriculture since my pet treats are all natural and therefore could only be taken to one show where i would either sell out and people would be angry that i didnt have more or i wouldnt hardly sell any and be stuck with tons of them and they too much for my dogs to eat ive primarily stopped taking them to events and rely on things like my bandanas and such that cant go bad this information is important later in the story a few springs ago i was attending a dog cancer walk event at the time i had nothing but treats everything was going well i was selling out fast and everyone was so sweet about halfway through the show a woman came up to me and started a somewhat lengthy conversation with me about her dog her dog had just had surgery and wouldnt be able to eat anything but her restricted diet for two weeks but she wanted some treats for her for when she felt better she wanted my suggestion on which treats would be easiest on her stomach when she was just coming off of a restricted diet i told her all about the different varieties i carried and which ones had what benefit for dogs then i explained to her that all the treats had to be refrigerated once you got them home i brought them in cooler bags and would be good for six weeks in the refrigerator however i would be more than happy just to make fresh treats for the dog in two weeks and deliver them to her in fact i tried to insist upon it i dont know what it was but something about this ladys demeanor just told me that there was going to be some kind of issue if i didnt alas i was unable to convince her she decided on the pumpkin treats since they are easy on a dogs stomach and promote digestion and decided just to keep them in the refrigerator for the two weeks her dog was unable to eat them which was fine they would keep i stressed the part about refrigerating them to her i showed her on the label where it said to refrigerate them my business partner also told her the same thing as well as offered that we could make them fresh in two weeks and deliver them she also had that same weird feeling about this lady fast forward two and a half weeks i get an email from any angry lady stating that she was at that specific event and telling me that she had just opened up her treats that morning and they were all moldy i emailed her back right away asking her a few questions and low and behold its the same lady which i should have figured out because of how long it took her to open the treats after a few emails back and forth she admitted that she had kept them in her car for two weeks in the degree weather we were having an unusually hot spring and that there was nothing on the label telling her to refrigerate them nor had she been told to i was mentally smacking her through the internet i was a little upset at this woman accidents happen and im understanding of that so had she just told me she forgot them in her car i would not have been angry but to blame us no however her language in the email told me a lot she kept referring to myself and my business partner as those girls who were at your booth i realized quite quickly that she didnt know myself and my business partner were the ones running the booth and that we were a small business she thought that we were just two employees that the business owner had sent out into the wild to help and that she could throw this on them and i would believe it even though i had handed her the business card with my name on it and told her i was the owner this time though i didnt correct her it was my first year in business and because i didnt want to get a bad name i told her that i couldnt refund her because she had left the treats in the car but i could replace them and i would also deliver them to her she lived a half an hour away but i felt that i had to do what i had to do to make the customer happy honestly it would have been cheaper and easier to refund her as i wouldnt have money into making a batch of treats for one jar and i could just mail the check out but i felt something was fishy and i wanted to investigate it further so i took this route i told her i needed the molded treats back in their original packaging for the exchange she asked me why and i explained to her that like any other retail store we need the bad items to exchange it for a new one this is a policy i stand by today she balked at this and suddenly i had a feeling that something was fishy especially considering she was very careful in her email to specify that she had just opened the treats that morning and the email came through before am one would surmise that she either still had the treats or if she had thrown them away they were on top of the garbage and easy to fish out let me just make a side note and let you guys know they were in a mason jar so it wasnt like garbage could have destroyed the packaging i even told her i would just take the mason jar back if she had thrown the treats out because those things arent cheap and she balked at that too regardless she and i make a date for me to bring the treats to her and she asks me again if im sure i need the old treats back i tell her yes the date comes and i specially make the treats fresh for her that morning i would like to note that i didnt have any other shows for a month and a half past the date we were supposed to meet so any treats that didnt fit in the jar went to my dogs i wasnt going to be selling them anywhere springtime into early summer is a horrible time for events and shows in this area so unless theyre dog related i dont do them and nothing dog related was coming up also with the pumpkin treats theres no way to really evenly split the can of pumpkin and keep the rest of it so its still good for the next time i want to make treats so i basically have to make the whole can all at one time to guarantee them fresh this makes a ton of treats well the day of right as im getting ready to walk out the door she cancels with the excuse that she isnt feeling well and has to go to the doctor thats cool it happens however the next day she has available for me to take her the treats is almost two weeks away i dont like to sell treats to customers that more than two days old that way i can guarantee that they stay good in the refrigerator for six weeks this whole batch of pumpkin treats go to my dogs i make fresh treats for her the morning of the next time we are to meet and she cancels again right as i was leaving the third time i was supposed to meet with her she emails me that morning and tells me she cant meet with me because she has to catch a flight as shes going on vacation this was the point that i had just had it with her she clearly knew ahead of time that she was going on vacation that day and had to catch a flight and she had been the one to pick the days i told her that she was still welcome to the treats but she had to come get them because i would not make another day to meet her after she canceled three times in a row less than an hour before i was to be there i was very polite but i had to put my foot down somewhere not only that but my dogs couldnt eat all the treats i had made for her in those three times and although i took them to the animal shelter down the road and they got good use out of them it was just a lot of unnecessary work and money i had to put out she asked for a refund and i again told her that i could not do that since she had been the one to leave the treats in the car when we had told her they needed refrigerated and it was on the label as well she tried to tell me those girls must not have put the proper labels on and no one told her about refrigerating them all over again thats when i very politely and professionally decided to tell her that it was actually myself and my business partner that were at the booth and its just the two of us running the business in fact i remembered her well because she had told me her dog had just had surgery and had to eat a special diet for two weeks so she was keeping the treats for when the dog felt better and we had offered to make her the treats fresh in two weeks and deliver them to her but she refused i also expressed to her that i had made the labels and put them on myself they were labels that were approved by the department of agriculture and ones that i was legally obligated to put on and that also legally had to include the fact that they had to be refrigerated i never heard from her again after that i personally believe she was trying to pull a fast one one me every time we set up another date she would ask me if i really needed the old treats back i repeatedly told her i would just take the jar if she had thrown them out and she still tried to talk me out of it the fact that she kept asking me about needing them back and she kept canceling on me at the last minute only to try for another refund just struck me funny i was bringing them to her she didnt have to go out of her way for any part of this and i was doing it all on her schedule and her chosen days also she spent at least an hour emailing me back and forth on the last day we talked so she clearly wasnt too eager to catch that flight she so desperately had to cancel on me to catch this lady is one of the reasons that i now only sell nonperishable items tldr lady buys pet treats from me at an event we tell her they need refrigerated plus my department of agriculture licensing requires me to have instructions to refrigerate them on the label she contacts me two and a half weeks later tells me she left her treats in the car in degree heat and they molded she says the girls at the booth never told her they needed refrigerated not realizing myself and my business partner were the ones at the booth and that the label didnt say anything about refrigerating them wants a refund i offer her new treats we set up a date for me to take them to her three times she cancels on me every single time as im walking out the door i finally tell her that my treats require the labels to say that they need to be refrigerated i labeled them myself and the girls at the booth that she spoke with were myself and my business partner she never bothers me again edit a lot of you are asking some great questions the department of agriculture heavily regulates how i can and cannot sell my treats how i can and cannot store them what qualifies as all natural and what doesnt etc but basically i have to sell them a certain way to comply with the department of agriculture regulations they check everything 
my store offers knife sharpening its normally dollars a blade but sometimes we have promotions where the first blade is free also machine sharpening costs the same as stone sharpening which is insane and kind of a stupid thing since using a stone takes not only longer to do but is a skill not many of us at my store have its not easy to learn compared to the machine and since most peoples knives cost several hundred dollars its sort of a huge risk on our part to do it even though they sign a liability waiver saying that if the knife gets damaged its not our fault because you know how customers are if something went wrong it would be our fault even though theres a legal document stating otherwise guy comes in wants knife sharpened i tell him price gtguy last time it was free i thought it was always free gtme because its a service that requires additional service and time we do charge a fee for it however we do run promos from time to time where first blade is free and the rest are still normal priced gtguy are you sure that seems odd youre already paid hourly why isnt it free note that the guy wasnt being rude he was just genuinely curious we talk about how its a service being offered just like gift wrapping or having your car washed were a store we mostly sell stuff but do have these other things too the guy is still incredibly polite and im having a really good talk about differences in sharpening methods and whats exactly happening to the knife during sharpening and the different stones and sharpeners something most customers dont want to hear about because they dont care they just want a good sharp knife and they want it now even though he was trying to get a service that in all honestly we dont charge enough for with the amount of time and training it took to master hes a pretty fantastic dude with not getting frustrated even though he did drive a decent distance to be there i later pulled his purchase history up cause i was curious and he does spend a lot of money with us too those last two points being things customers try and tell me all the time when theyre whining about how they deserve a discount after a while of talking about the above mentioned things the following amazing thing happened gtguy well i feel bad taking up your time he wasnt it was slow and i was enjoying the conversation with someone who was actually interested in what i had to say but i just dont want to pay for this would it be alright and not against any promotional rules if i just waited til the next promo and bring the knife in then why cant all customers be this reasonable like hey theres a thing i want you offer a discount on it it happens multiple times a year and i dont need it right now it sucks the discount isnt right now but ill wait til it is but first let me also make sure thats okay it is just for his attitude i offered to do it for him then and there explaining it would take about half hour to an hour for set up and the process maybe longer depending on business since it was slow i could have easily done it but he was gonna wait til it was actually the promo because he didnt realize how long it would takewe wasted too much time talking about other stuff and didnt have the time that day and didnt want to drop his knife off and come back laterand tell his friends to come with us and he told my boss how great i was so pretty much hes the best ever and i cant wait for him to come back tldr customer had fully functioning brain am shocked

my gas station offers a freetouse air pump so people can inflate their tires however its out of order right now people tend to not hang up the hose then drive over it when they drive away as a courtesy we also keep a tire gauge behind the counter that people can use a customer walks in the other day and asks if he can use the tire gauge i hand it to him assuming he knows our air pump isnt working he reenters the store a minute later gtguy hey you know i need to put air in my tires and your air pump isnt working i tried using it and now my tires have less air than before i guess gtpt font wasnt large enough for our out of order sign before i can apologize for the inconvenience he goes on gtguy i know a place that has a working air pump but they dont have a gauge so im going to borrow this okay he holds up the tire gauge i handed him is he serious gtme i cant let you do that gtguy really cmon ill bring it right back gtme sorry i cant just let you walk off with store property the guy scoffs at me and whips the tire gauge back across the counter so that it falls on the floor gtguy tch thanks a lot buddy yeah sorry we dont run a rental service i mean we sell tire gauges for less than 
years ago as a young assistant manager of a video rental store we only had a handful of customers one night that were browsing around the store and these three kids maybe years old come in one of them has their large pet snake around his neck i genuinely didnt care and it wasnt as if we have an official no animals policy i notice some of the customers were a bit on edge when he walked by them so i decide to talk with him gtme sir could you please take your pet outside gtkid why gtme we dont allow animals in the store and that some of the customers were becoming uncomfortable gtkid well what if i was blind and had a seeing eye dog gtme sir we dont get a lot of blind people coming into a video rental store even his friends could be heard giggling at it i felt so good even though it was only some punk kid i had embarrassed

hi guys im a year old student and i had been working at a local independent bookstore for roughly six months just to make some disposable income and not have to rely on my parents so heavily for cash from day one the ownerboss was extremely rude shorttempered and condescending towards me and all of the other employees if anybody made a small mistake or did anything to somehow upset the owner lets call her gertrude they would be berated reprimanded and cursed at by gertrude i always considered myself to be a good employee always on time usually early always did what i was told and more always told her at least a week ahead if my shift had to change and really helped to get more customers in for events one time she had to leave early to take her daughter to the doctor and i was left completely alone to run the store for several hours while she was gone one saturday i was scheduled to work from am to pm the store was extremely slow that day and there was another girl working as well as gertrude my older sister was having surgery that morning so i was a bit anxious all day my mother called me frantically at around pm saying i had to come home immediately to take care of my sister who had just gotten released from the hospital and could not be left alone since my parents had to go deal with a different emergency that couldnt be put off whatsoever i figured it wouldnt be a big deal this was the first and only time i had ever had to leave work on such short notice the store was completely dead and there wasnt any other work to be done i went to go inform my boss gtme hey gertrude im really sorry but im going to have to leave at pm to go take care of my sister she just got out of surg gtboss what how old is she she can take care of herself how dare you you are not leaving you are not going anywhere gtme my mother just called me frantically i really have to gtboss you go call your mother right now and tell her that your ass is staying here i dont care this is unacceptable you should be ashamed my boss scolded me for at least minutes and once she was finished i ran into the back room to call my mother while nearly hysterical from all of the stress she told me she would be calling the store to talk to gertrude and not to worry five minutes later me and gertrude were both at the front desk where the phones and computers are located the phone rings and i can see on the screen that its my mother i cant hear much of the conversation but gertrude hung up on my mother angrily and then turned to me gtboss there seems to be a miscommunication tell your mother that you have a job at this point i was furious with gertrude and so fed up with her constant verbal abuse i didnt need this job badly enough to put up with this so i looked her dead in the eye and said gtme no i dont not anymore i punched out and i walked out the front door it was the single most satisfying feeling to see my boss completely speechless for once i emailed her to send my last check in the mail and i havent returned since 
hi tfr i work in the jewelry industry and i have a lot of stories about difficult andor overly emotional customers but this one is really the most ridiculous it happened last fall when i was working as an assistant at a small jewelry and watch repair store guy comes in with a diving watch rubber bracelet waterproof with a latch meant to expand the band to fit over a wetsuit and wants me to cut it to fit his son on these types of watches you actually cut the rubber on the band to make it fit the wearer so i measure the kid and cut the watch to fit him about seconds after they leave the guy walks back in the door alone and starts yelling about me making it too small i ask him to go get his son so i can check it again i can get two fingers underneath the band it fits either way he demands that we get a new bracelet for it and starts going on and on about how expensive it was and how he got it in milan and thats when i know its going to be a nightmare flash forward a few weeks and he drops off a packet of papers with a demand for payment of almost for wire transfer fees calls to italy and a new band at nearly twice the cost of the exact same one we already ordered my boss refuses to pay in part due to the disparaging language he was using to describe me and my work and his inability to understand that we can actually get watch parts that he cant since we were in the industry it wasnt a wellknown watch company so we had to go through some alternate channels to get the bracelet but we definitely got the exact bracelet he shows up a few days later looking for his money and when my boss refuses to pay him he starts screaming and shouting and telling him he will ruin the business and that we havent seen the last of him guy shows up an hour later with his son and literally protests our store like with poster board signs that say they butchered my watch and encourages his kid to go talk to people coming into our store and tell them to go somewhere else we call the cops and i was hoping he would get mouthy with the officer and get tased in front of our store no such luck but our property manager banned him from the entire shopping center and he definitely got put in handcuffs for a minute and got a ticket for trespassing the thing that really disturbed me the most was him dragging his kid into it i hate knowing that kid will go out into the world thinking thats how you treat people to get what you want ugh

ninja edit sorry for the wall of text im a wordy person and feel this story is best in all its glory i work alone at a dry cleanerlaundromat this lady comes in and hands me her tickets to pick up her dry cleaning she had more than the average bears worth of dry cleaning spread out over a few tickets i add up her total twice and check to make sure it matches her receipt okay your total is she looks at me flabbergasted for a second no its not the guy told me that it was ill double check the math i added everything up again and said no im sorry this is see no youre wrong why would he tell me that it was he must have been giving me a discount he might have misspoke or miscalculated but he wrote right here on your ticket well you need to get him on the phone then i need to talk to your manager im sorry that man is not the manager my manager doesnt actually work at the store im in charge for the day well im going to need his number she was huffing and puffing at this point and i was also getting shakey my boss had given me a no nonsense policy and tells me to ask customers to leave and not come back when they get indignant she also doesnt want me calling her for any reason shes not a very good manager im sorry to be honest with you i dont know the other employees number and i cant give you my managers cell phone number well then call her get her on the phone right now im sorry i cant call her in the middle of the day shes at work right now im the manager right now this argument repeats until she gets the picture im not paying anymore than what that man told me is all you can have thats fine if you just want to pick up a few things we can hold on the the rest until you can pay for them are you fucking kidding me youre going to be stealing my clothes from me i can take them if i want to well weve already provided you a service im not going to give them back until you pay for them protip using big words like this piss people off in retrospect i was being condescending at this point she goes over to her clothes and starts tearing them out of the bags shes throwing the bags all over the floor huffing and mumbling and tearing her clothes off the hangers these look like shit im not paying for these im sorry id be happy to redo them for you it would be ready to pick up in two days fuck i need them this weekend no you cant redo them but im not paying full price im sorry the total is still i was not giving in who the fuck do you think you are she screamed i then make the worst mistake of my life i chuckle not to be condescending but because i am really uncomfortable i mean really uncomfortable even after five years in retail i am in awe every time some yells at me like this i am a humanist and am still constantly in shock that people can be so aggressive and hateful im naive whatever anyway i chuckle a nervous isladygoingtokillme laugh she loses it this is not a fucking joke im not fucking playing with you right now my husband is going to kill me when i get home if i spend fucking dollars on these clothes do you understand that hes already pissed off with me and hes pissed off with you for taking so fucking long to get his clothes done you do not want him to come here i do not want to bother him with this shit hes already pissed off with me which makes me more uncomfortable thinking her husband probably beats her maam please stop cursing at me there are kids in here there were im not cursing at you if i was cussin at you id be call you a skanky fatass bitch cunt fucking heifer im not calling you any of those things am i alright ive hit my limit im sorry im going to have to ask you to leave you cant do that im going to call um okay i was really confused she took out her cell phone and called hello im at this dry cleaner and im having a domestic dispute we need an officer right away yes thank you i look around for a bit trying to wrap my brain around whats happening and said okay well im going to get some work done while we wait for the police i picked up all the trash and hangers she threw all over the floor in retrospect i should have left them as evidence she was being crazy i guess she might have said i threw it at her the police station is right up the road so it wasnt a long wait oh she called in late for work while she watched me pick up her mess the officer came in and he was super polite and calm she recounted her story which was mostly true if a little biased me not giving her a discount me not calling the manager she also added that i owed her for the money she was missing by not being at work in time she did say that i told her she had to leave after she called because i was trying to hide the evidence lolwhut i then said that wasnt true that she called the police after i asked her to leave the officer looked a little confused and asked me what happened he turned back to the lady and said okay what can thiscity police department do for you today she said well officer if im not happy with the service i need a discount he turned to the lady and said you know i dont want to discourage you from calling when you need to you should call if youre in danger or in the case of criminal activity but this is a dispute that the police department cant settle for you why dont you come back on another day to pick up your clothes yes sir officer thats a good idea i agree he said im going to need you to step outside with me so that i can get your information just in case you need me again and she left he took her info outside and she got in her car and presumably drove to work she came back the next day and payed for her dry cleaning i felt really bad for her

greetings tfr again from the wonderful world of bitches dont know bout our friendliness drivethru todays tale is about a customertocustomer act of spitefulness that i not only took part in but did so gleefully our drivethrus design is a source of contention for many people heres a crude drawing of it note my lt mzzpn skllz dwg two speaker boxes both converging into a single line that goes to the payment then pickup windows seems simple enough like itd be hard for anyone to screw that up right if you really believe that to be the case i urge you to read more of this sub such high faith in the intelligence of the common person is not healthy seek help the general idea is that whomever has had their order finished first goes first often this is not the case as the urge to get their greaseladen lardwiches and ginormosized sweet teas frequently causes people to disregard any notion of traffic safety and view vehicular assault as a perfectly justifiable means to shave off a whole four seconds between them ordering their meal and receiving their food conversely this also creates people who feel that they should have gone first despite them taking an additional thirty seconds to order their slop and instills within them an indignant fury that just needs to be released this is about the latter our players in this story are a lady named bengie why bengie because she works at a veterinarians clinic and has a dog that looks kinda like benji me of course and a really angry fella well call angrybieber why angrybieber because he was angry and had a stupid justin bieber haircut probably the source of his anger now that i think about it it was a rather typical day for business we had a line of cars in the drivethru things are kinda moving a little more slowly than normal im taking orders in the outside lane and also taking money the usual i open my window to receive payment for an order when a couple cars back i hear some frantic car horn honking slightly annoyed but thinking nothing of it i continue my duties bengie gets to my window gt me ello please gt bengie hey bud how are ya gt me about normal here standing probably should be working gt car behind us honk angry unintelligible shouting gt bengie id also like to pay for the guy behind me note about a order so nothing big hes been shouting at me because he thinks i cut him off back there gt me are you absolutely certain you want to do this gt bengie as she flashes a slight devilish smirk yes also tell him i said lifes too short to be so angry with these transactions completed she heads up to the pickup window angrybieber approaches gt me el gt angrybieber interrupting me and quite living up to his name and stupid stupid haircut did you see that that angry cword pulled out in front of me let me take a moment here that angry cword as he so eloquently put it is one of the nicest damn people i have ever met and is one of the sweetest regular customers i have im not joking shes so sweet that she once performed a blood sister and killed her partner through diabetic ketoacidosisthis may or may not be true also theres a monitor that displays camera footage of our speaker boxes in my booth i pay attention to it i took angrybiebers order it was indisputable that bengie was supposed to go before angrybieber and it was angrybieber who was trying to cut in line back to the story gt me as calmly as i could that very nice lady just paid for your meal gt angrybiebs in confusion waiwha gt me nodding mhmm gt angrybiebs youre joking gt me nope she asked me to tell you lifes too short to be so angry the look on angrybiebers face was priceless it was such a beautiful combination of confusion shock and shame pure unbridled shame i cannot find the words the describe how wonderful it was they should have sent a poet angrybieber tried to stammer out a response but was too embarrassed to do so i handed him a receipt told him to have a nice day and he slowly crept away from my window with his head hung low tldr sweetest person ever makes angry jerk feel shame for being an angry jerk with a simple act of kindness edit woah thank you so much for the gold anonymous benefactor
some guys like to do this to female cashiers and although it is a small gesture it is incredibly demeaning and always pisses me off when he goes to pay with cash it is always a guy that does this in my experience he holds the money out then pulls it away as the cashier reaches for it then he looks her straight in the eye as if expecting her to giggle coyishly or to plead for his money i refuse to reach for anyones money after they do this and make them set it on the counter im ringing you up not giving you a lap dance so im not gonna put on a show for your money
quick story i just told a friend and figured id commit to the ages here after i left the store i have spoken at length about i was working for a chain of craft supply stores i was hired on as a manager but they didnt actually have a store to put me in so i was serving as acting store manager in multiple locations basically if you were the store manager and went on vacationwere in the hospital or if a manager had been fired or quit and they were moving in the new store manager they would just have me fill in at the store until things settled i did this for eight months travelling over eight states living out of hotel rooms which wasnt actually what i signed on for but thats another story so i am in new york covering a store and in walks a guy with a return all returns in this company were handled by a manager and we had final discretion in this case the guy was obviously pulling some scam the product was used and had old packaging but he had a new receipt plus he had an out of state license he claimed that he was on vacation but who takes along a receipt to make a return from two months ago while on vacation he huffed and puffed when i told him no and threatened to go to another location that night i got a call from my dm a manager had been fired and they were relocating me now i drove overnight to virginia edit realizing that not everyone knows distance here i drove for hours that night non stop save for bathroom breaks its really far away i met my dm at the store to get the keys and story and stuck around a little while before crashing at the hotel halfway through the day i get paged that a customer has a return i come up and its the same guy i let him talk about his return show me his receipt then i smile and say just like i told you in new york you cant do this return he stared at me for a moment im a redhead so he slowly recognized me eyes going wide and he backed away he glanced over at the doorway i had come from confused then he just left leaving his receipt behind the other store wasnt his local store where the receipt was from either although closer to home so he had just apparently tried to pull the same scam elsewhere only to meet omnimanager 
woo christmas bring on the crazies a woman approximately yrs old bought a few groceries with a carton of eggs she gives me a coupon its off when you buy a certain brand of butter and eggs together but i bought the butter last time i bought both of them so now i need the discount not how that works i tell her gently it has to be on the same transaction she gets so mad she starts shaking and mincing her words she insists that im full of crap basically another assistant manager was listening and comes over to help me bag she decides to scan the coupon to show the lady cant be read i dont care the crazy lady fumes i bought eggs and butter i ask for a receipt to make a point she has none of course you know what the other assistant says i believe you with a turn of a key and a wink of an eye this lady has a discount she walks away satisfied later my coworker approaches me and says you know she just thinks she got that discount she actually paid full price turns out that coupon didnt even come from our store because we dont have that brand of butter i laughed the hardest i had laughed all day
so i was working at a popular video game store a couple years back when fifa was just being released it was a high volume store so we got plenty of copies this also meant we had a huge amount of preorders people would often preorder the game specifically to get the included collectors items and we had one customer well call him fred that called up the day before and preordered the collectors edition for his sons th birthday it was one of the last ones we had in stock so he was lucky to snag it in time fast forward to release day and it was crazy busy for the first time since id worked there we actually sold every one of our preorders on release day as well as all of our regular stock except for one freds copy so the day chugged along busily and as it drew to a close we only had one copy left which was reserved for fred i was constantly turning people down for sales of the game or signing them up for a copy when a new shipment arrived i then left the register to do some inventory for minutes before returning in just minutes my genius colleague managed to sell freds copy of fifa i didnt know this had happened so about minutes after id returned to the register fred and his wife walks in and asks to pick up his sons copy of the game i do a search for the game and our stock says a big fat zero this includes reserved stock me im sorry sir we just sold the last copy there must have been a mixup and your reserved copy was sold to another customer fred what but i reserved it its for my sons th birthday tonight me i apologize its entirely our fault we dont have any copies to sell you today but i can put you on a waiting list for the next shipment that comes to the store if youd like its at this point i notice freds wife is crying i notice that fred is visibly trying to control his anger but his face is going red and i can see that the situation is not getting any better fred my sons birthday is tonight and i promised him wed play the new fifa tonight what am i going to do this is unfair i feel very sorry for these people and i realize that this is a very unfair situation for them so i improvise me im really sorry sir let me do a quick search for other stores in the area that have stock and heres a off voucher for the game i hope that makes up for our mistake as i was talking i found a store about minutes away that had stock of the game as i handed the voucher to fred his entire composure changed completely he was dumbfounded and a massive smiled exploded onto his face fred oh wow thank you so much ill go there right now and pick the game up thank you ill definitely come back to this store from now on and his wife thanked me profusely as well i felt great id made a familys day kept a customer happy and probably saved the store a lot of bad wordofmouth those are the moments that make retail worthwhile as i was closing up that night the store manager came up and started talking to me store manager fathead i saw what you did with those customers today you do realise thats a serious breach of store policy thats off the other stores margin those vouchers are supposed to be for the ltother gamegt promotion only im going to speak to the area manager about this and i never want to see you do that again without my permission i was speechless i could not believe a manager could be so moneyhungry that hed prefer to absolutely piss a customer off because of my colleagues mistake over giving them a voucher and making them happy as anything i was furious that night because even though it was apparently against store policy i didnt deserve to be told off next day i come in for my shift and the area manager is talking to the store manager i get pulled into the back room area manager fathead store manager has filled me in on what you did yesterday with the coupon unfortunately that is a serious breach of store policy and were going to have to terminate your employment please give me your store key and leave immediately i was actually not really that surprised i was only a casual and so they could fire me on a whim and the area manager was equally as pennypinching as the store manager me you know what dont bother firing me i dont want to work here if youre going to treat me like this i tried my best to keep the customer happy but hey dont let me stop you from pissing off the people who pay your wage did store manager tell you it was ltemployeegts fault their reserved game was sold to someone else i guess thats perfect grounds for firing the employee that fixed the situation now theres some good management then i dropped my store key on the ground and walked out without another word maybe that was a bit too rude but i just couldnt believe that theyd value over customer service just another example of managers power tripping and pennypinching without caring for the people they are there to service oh well im glad they fired me it was a terrible place to work tldr i rant for ages about getting fired for fixing our stores mistake

nice woman on black friday i was the backup cashier for a big name bookstore on black friday i opened the store at am expecting the worst because of the groups of people at either end of the store however it stayed relatively quiet for this most auspicious day of the year i was walking around in the toys and games section which was bogo off and spy this young but petite woman trying to lug around a ton of elf on the shelf accessories books clothes dolls which are not part of the sale like a good retail slave i notify her of the sale and then i ask her if i can hold those items for her at the register she thanks me politely for the assistance gets excited about the deals and gets back to shopping i pass her again about minutes later and shes got another armload which i also take back to the register i do this about four more times no exaggeration she had a ton of toys when she was finally ready to check out she comes to my till i eye the pile of goodies nervously and ask her if its ok to ring these items up in separate transactions she had gotten two of everything two play tents to of the learning touch globes two elephants two lions to tigersoh wait thats noah well you get the gist she had a ton the smart computer would only get her bogo on the cheapest items some packs of math dice instead of buy one globe get the next globe off she agrees to do separate transactions to get her the best deal since im going to be with her for a while chat her up when she tells me that shes not buying these gifts for her or her children but for the children of some underprivileged kids from a nearby shelter i was incredibly touched she was so patient and sweet through the whole thing not in a rush like so many other black friday deal vultures she even got the store membership that we offer to get her even more of a discount yay for reaching my quota on the first transaction in the end she spend about none of it on herself since she has to make several trips out to her car i help her load it up and she gives me a tip insane it made my day people like her are the reason i come to work good patient people 
firstly i would like to send out my heartfelt thanks to everyone who responded with advice and indignation on my behalf over this incident seriously you guys are all awesome for anyone who hasnt read about what shall henceforth be known as the incident in my memory banks you can read it today or i suppose yesterday as it is well past midnight now i got a call back into the office to speak with our dm on the phone what had apparently happened and was misinterpreted by my gm was that the complaint was forwarded to him and he just forwarded it to our store he had never actually read what the complaint was outside of customer was humiliated and insulted so he wanted immediate action taken still really shitty response but it is what it is he apologized to me profusely for several minutes before telling me that the writeup was to be rescinded and that no disciplinary action would be on my employment file for this i have to say i am still feeling all warm and fuzzy several hours after listening to him eat crow over this he is normally such a jerk it was lovely i did make a point to tell the dm that my managers shouldnt be punished for following his direction this was me unashamedly covering of my own ass i need this job and i wont have them thinking i was trying to get them in trouble despite the fact that if it hadnt been handled the way it was i would have done my best to crucify them i will fully recognize and acknowledge that it was an act to mollify my managers my asm and gm have both apologized to me as well hr must have jumped right on this because i really wasnt expecting to hear anything about it for a few weeks yet i did tell them that i understood their need to write me up after a direct email from the dm but that i was hurt that i was chastised for going my job asm told me that she understood how i felt and that she would feel the same way though the gm didnt seem to have much to say about it at all outside of being sorry that all this happened i still think they should have told me it was a shit complaint when they talked to me the first time but it has happened so im letting it go i will give my own apology to those who so very much wanted me to fight this harder than i did and for leaving it at this i got the outcome i really wanted an admission of wrongdoing and an apology i have a two year old who is growing faster than i can keep clothes on her and i need to be able to support her as much as i hate my company i need this job and i really cant afford to piss off the people who make my schedule they have back tracked so quickly and i am feeling some serious righteous vindication this had actually turned out so much better than i thought it would thank you again to all of you
i worked in the electronics department of a major retailer which meant i often had to deal with purchases that could only be rung up at the electronics register no way wed let someone walk around with expensive merchandise before paying for it sometimes however people would come to electronics to check out because they didnt want to wait in the normal line usually this pissed me off because if a help needed in the game console aisle alert goes off im busy ringing up someone that couldnt be bothered to wait in the normal line its a slower part of the morning in electronics and i see an elderly chinese man waiting near the electronics cash register after asking him if i could help with an electronics purchase he smiled and said he just needs to buy a pack of gum normally id be a little irked but it was slow and this man seemed genuinely nice after ringing up the purchase i hand him his change he looks at it pauses for a second and the conversation goes like this gt customer perhaps i could have newer bills ones that are more crisp gt me after a pause yeah sure let me see what i can dig out im not sure why he wants newer bills theyre still worth the same amount im guessing he sees the look on my face gt c its for chinese new year money for my grandchildren otherwise i wouldnt care what condition its in gt m ohhhhh ok yeah i think i have some newer bills what animal is it the year of gt c the ox gt m i think im an ox i was born in at this point the mans face lights up gt c very good youll have amazing luck this year we talk a bit more about it the man is so delighted that he got his new bills and was able to talk about chinese new year with someone that knew very little about it by far my best one on one with a guest ever

sometimes though there are people who are out to make our lives miserable on one particular occasion my coworker and i were excited to see a sudden rush of customers carrying large boxes from a certain popular brand of construction blocks it had been a relatively slow day moneywise and the toys were expensive so that many large sales in a row would really boost our days sales figures i happily start scanning in the first customers items while my coworker gets out some of the big bags to fit the items in then i tell the customer the total then all hell breaks loose gt customer what thats not right its supposed to be on sale gt me confused i dont think so we dont have a catalog on at the moment and theres no sale ticket on the item gt customer dont you know anything its supposed to be of brand toy today at this point the customers that had been lining up behind customer have slowly moved forward and are encircling the counter you can practically see the hysteria start to spread as they clutch their large sets they want that discount and are in full support of customer my coworker and i share a glance because this situation is not looking good and we know damn well that theres no sale on brand toy our store is an individual owned retailer and rarely ever does general discounts on product ranges and that particular brand only ever gets given a general discount in the boxing day sales gt me are you sure its our store doing the sale big department store next door has a toy section and they often do big general sales gt customer yes its your store the guy said it was this store the surrounding customers chime in with their agreement and my ears prick up gt me the guy what guy gt customer exasperated the guy the one standing down in the brand toy section he said its brand toys th birthday and so toy retailer is doing off all brand toy for one day only my coworker and i look at each other again i can tell the same thing is going through both of out minds wtf at this point i turn to try and address all the customers present there was about eight of them all surrounding the counter gt me im sorry but there seems to be a misunderstanding here neither our store nor brand toy have a representative standing in the brand toy section that guy has no authority to give out the discounts hes claiming are available im afraid youve fallen for a hoax theres a pause as this news starts to sink in and i start to relax surely logic will prevail and the customers will realize that they have been tricked through no fault of ours yeah and maybe well all laugh and hug and start singing some weird little song showing how today weve learned not to believe the promises of random strangers s gt customer you still have to give me the discount though gt me caught off guard what gt customer standing straight and smiling smugly you still have to give me the discount its false advertising otherwise some of the other customers at this point have left their brand toy on the counter and left but theres about three more desperate ones clinging on to customer s new argument in the hopes that they can still get off their sets gt me but were not the ones that are advertising some random guy is gt customer but we couldnt have known that its advertising in your store so you have to honor it gt me shake head in disbelief no it doesnt work like that some random guy telling you that you get off brand toy does not mean you get off brand toy otherwise wed have someone in here every day giving out random discounts gt customer losing confidence butbut the guy said gt me the guy lied gt customer this is outrageous you cant treat your customers like this gt me im sorry theres really nothing i can do customer slams his brand toys on the counter and starts to storm out gt customer ill be calling consumer affairs about you youve just lost yourselves a good sale he stormed out kind of slowly as if he expected us to relent at those last words and give him the discount i just shrugged and turned back to my remaining customers with their fearless leader gone they were starting to see their cause was futile they piled up their brand toy on the counter and started to leave as well a couple gave some halfhearted threats about not returning but they left peacefully enough my coworker stepped forward to put down the phone shed picked up shed been standing behind me ready to call security the whole time in case the customers turned ugly annoyed with the whole situation i left my coworker with the stacked brand toy and stormed down the aisle to the brand toy section there was no one there i had a look around the shop but it seems that the argument at the counter had scared off all our other customers stupid troll customer included sure i can laugh about it now but at that moment i was not a happy person edit apparently im allowed to say the toy that everyone was after which was lego this is only my second post on reddit and i wasnt sure if the no names rule applied to brands however ive been told that the no names only applies to the business that the story occurs in to protect identities etc 
on this particular day im on cash im in the middle of talking to this lovely woman about her purchases and i have a small line of people behind her waiting patiently this late s guy walks up to my register shoves a hat in my face and says price i scan the item to give him the price but before handing it back to him i scold him by saying next time im going to ask you to hop in line because you just jumped in front of people he looked so ashamed he muttered sorry and sulked off about minutes later he came back up waited patiently behind another person and when it was his turn he apologized profusely for his previous misdemeanour old dogs new tricks etc

hello lovelies this is my first post to this subreddit so forgive me for formatting issues and such so onto the story i used to work at a martial arts club but the master was the overly religious type and i simply couldnt stand him anymore nice guy and all but i just couldnt take it i quit that job and now work at a famous hardware supply store which is perfect for me since im a pretty big guy and pounds if i did those conversions right canadian i enjoy the job but we do get a lot of well those customers this story isnt exactly about that so the store had just opened and im already helping people with their items getting things off shelves cutting wood etc when i hear a loud crash from the aisle where we keep all of our nails screws bolts and other small metal objects that are hard to clean up i go to investigate and find six children running around the aisle knocking down shelves full of nails and screws which were now all over the floor needless to say this is a hazard so i tell them to get away from there and then the mother hoo boy their mother who was a rather large woman began to rail at me while walking over that i cant tell her kids what to do and that its her responsibility gtme well thats fine maam but can you please tell them to gther no they can play if they want i was about to leave it until i heard the sound that we all probably dread in a hardware store one of the kids is crying he couldnt have been older than or and he had a inch nail embedded in his arm he had fallen while playing i frantically get another employee to call while putting pressure on it gther how could you have been such an idiot you let my baby get hurt i attempt to ignore her while i calm the kid down but she will not stop yelling gtme maam i need you to please calm down youre scaring the chi gther shut up im suing this store once the paramedics get here i was done with her at this point and i honestly remember her saying a whole bunch of other crazy stuff that i wont go into detail about because this was weeks ago needless to say nothing ever came of her lawsuit in fact i believe she was fined or something for criminal negligence not sure really this was my first story out of many i hope the formatting wasnt too terrible
i used to work as the assistant manager in a small computer store where the management had to be at the store minutes before it opened to get everything ready for the day about minutes before the store opens a guy tries the door which of course was locked he immediately starts pounding on the door and signalling for me to come over i casually walk over to the door and through the closed door i politely explain that the store wont be open for another minutes and asked him to come back then this just set him off for some reason or another and the next words out of his mouth are just open the fucking door somehow i kept my cool and i again politely explain that we are not yet open and that i would be happy to help him if he came back after the store was open he replies i just need to buy a fucking laptop bag open the fucking door right now i explain that we havent yet prepared the store to accept sales and that he would have to wait until the store was open he replies with thats fucking bullshit just let me in at this point im the only one in the store and there was no way in hell i was going to let him in for any reason i finally told him that i wasnt able to help him and started to walk away he starts yelling again you expect me to fucking come back after you wouldnt let me in i turned around and calmly said id prefer you didnt then walked back to continue prepping the store he slams his hand on the glass door yells fuck you at me then gets into his pickup truck and burns out of the parking lot

several years ago i was the sales manager at a dealership for well known american made motorcycle one day i was walking through the motorcycles on the showroom floor i did this every day to make sure the correct price tags were hanging from the handlebar and to see if any of the bikes needed some attention from the detail guy on this particular day the dealership looked empty this was pretty normal for a winter weekday but it was ghost town empty while i was in the middle of all of the motorcycles i suddenly felt the need to pass gas i thought nothing of it beings the dealership looked empty so i let it go the dealership wasnt empty somehow a customer had come through the doors unnoticed and was crouched down in between a couple of the motorcycles looking at the engine nobody saw him including me when i let out what can only be described as a duck call his head popped up like a gopher out of his hole no expression no laughter just uncomfortably awkward eye contact i proceeded to walk over to my office and instructed one of my sales guys to take care of the surprise guest he ended up purchasing one and i being the sm took care of finalizing the deal and doing his financial paperwork nothing was said regarding my temporary indiscretion during this entire process when the sale was finalized and the customer was the happy owner of a brand new american made motorcycle i shook his hand and told him congratulations it was at that moment he looked me square in the eye and said i heard that he then gave a crooked smile and went on his happy way

so back when i worked in the electronics dept of a regional supermarket chain i encountered some interesting people figured id share here first one will be brief woman comes in carrying what appears to be a cell phone she says the battery is dead and she needs a new one we dont sell cellphone batteries and i told her so she decides to hand me the phone so i can check i flip it to the back after fiddling around with it for a while and find it does take double aa batteries i was shocked but just kinda shrugged it off i go pick her up some and ring her out she decides to put the batteries in on the spot oh she also decided to finally tell me she handed me a stun gun meant to look like a cellphone it still had some juice too so if handing an unknowing person a dangerous weapon isnt bad enough she decides to test to see if the batteries work in the store she fires off the stun gun before i even have a chance to stop her and the entire department just goes quiet at the loud crack best part was that loss preventionsecurity was standing in the area too and came running over i dont think she was allowed back in the store tldr woman comes in hands me a stun gun without telling me and then proceeds to make sure it works again by firing it off in the store

after finally getting a rather large queue down to one person i arrive at the last customer at my customer service desk this customer will here on in be known as breasts that change hardly gtme hi there how can i help gtbtch hi id like to exchange some lingerie gtme that should be fine but clothing returns must be done upstairs in the clothing department gtbtch really gtme sorry after six we take over clothing returns but for now youll have to pop upstairs she nods and another customer stands behind her gtme is everything ok gtbtch im still waiting for my exchange gtme and as i just mentioned youll have to go upstairs gtbtch well im not walking upstairs when this is the returns desk firstly its the customer service desk and ive got things other than returns to deal with secondly there arent even stairs to walk up there is a travelator around the corner or a lift you could take thirdlyscrew it ill do your refund i want my moment of queueless zen gtme ok then do you have a receipt gtbtch no gtme no problem do you have the products youd like to exchange these lingerie for with you gtbtch no just put it on a gift card youyouve done this before if ive learnt anything its that knowing our refund policy well usually means you try to abuse the system somehow im now in caution mode gtme thats fine theres no price tags on the lingerie which means theyve been used thats not an issue but having to find the codes on the clothing tags and typing them all manually is going to take a while two people join the queue some of the codes on the lingerie work but most arent on the systemand this lady has a lot of lingerie this suggests that some of these are old so old that they arent in warranty anymore gtme when did you buy these lingerie gtbtch last month youyou didnt even product withdrawals remain on the system past the warranty expiry so you cant pull that one ok lets go down the rabbit hole of playing returns detective gtme most of these arent on the system suggesting that they were bought so long ago that they arent currently under warranty gtbtch im telling you now that i bought all of them in december how else have some went through gtme well touch btch if some are on the system that means they must be under warranty yet i know youre up to something ahah gtme are any of the items damaged gtbtch no theyre all fine damn it i can usually tell when theyre lying but she seems to be telling the truth try another line of questioning gtme did you buy them all at once do you know when how did you pay gtbtch yeah but i dont know when i bought them or how so at this point im winning im not obliged to give her anything as she cant even prove her side or that she even purchased them i try to look busy as i come up with another way to deal with this one more person joins my queue gtme why are you bringing the products back wrong colour or style gtbtch no theyre just the wrong s gtme size her face said it all she had changed breast size and no offence but just by looking at her trolley contents you could see why none of her lingerie fit anymore so shes trying to swap for a bigger size for free i aint got an issue with that if theyre on the system but your trying to change your whole wardrobe for nothing gtme unfortunately i cant do anything with the ones not on the system gtbtch well this is shocking im a customer here and i deserve an exchange gtme the issue is gtbtch let me finish you dont actually have anything to say do you gtme the issue gtbtch it says on the label that it comes from this store how can you not exchange it gtme thats not the issue the issue is that i cant process the items as a refund gtbtch but i want an exchange gtme let me finish i need to be able to process the items as a refund on the system so that i can use the current selling value of these items to cover the cost of your new products thus completing an exchange they arent on the system which immediately suggests that its out of warranty and i cant just add some money as a random refund because i a would be breaking a ton of times and b have no idea what the value of all these products are furthermore this issue might even be resolvable if you could prove you purchased the products ie a receipt but you dont have that to back it up for all i know these products could be more than a year old silenceother than the sound of two more people joining the queue now you know whats coming dont you gtbtch can i speak to a manager gtme the clothing manager isnt in today gtbtch well ill speak to their manager gtme he should be available so the managers manager comes down to speak with the lady i briefly explained what was going on over the phone hes pretty helpful for his position and takes no crap whatsoever he basically runs through what ive said in a less sympathetic more concise manner i mean the guy is too busy to be dealing with this he says he will take her details and will have the clothing manager contact her gtbtch well why didnt you just do that at the start i lean over the counter staring at her glancing at the now long queue and stare back again i whisper gtme because you wanted an exchange remember gtbtch im going to contact your headquarters more prepared than i have ever been i whip out a piece of paper with the hq number on it gtbtch you have these prepared huh she snickers gtme nope first one i just knew youd want it thats what good customer service knowing what you want and giving you what you deserve i await a followup
hello tfr this will be my first post here i figured that when the customer service desk employees started regularly asking me if i had any new crazy stories to tell them i should start posting them too i work in the electronics department of a large national retail chain that sells a little of everything so a middleaged male guest approaches me and asks to check out alls well so far hes a bit brusque but customers being less than polite is old news right off the bat he tells me very firmly gthim i want to use up this prepaid visa so im splitting the payment this is of course totally fine and i assure him so in my best retail chirp he continues very seriously gthim theres only a penny on here but im not going to throw away good money you cant expect to win the lottery if you just throw money away i give a polite laugh at this its a strange enough phrase that i have to assume its a joke despite his intensely dour face i ring up his purchases and he then hands me an employee discount card to scan as well notably not one that belongs to him according to the very feminine name listed so i assume its a significant other which explains why he doesnt know why this is a problem gtme sir unfortunately if you use an employee discount you can only pay using cash or our store creditdebit card he stares at me i must clarify gtme i cant accept the prepaid card as a payment if you want to use the discount this shouldnt be a problem right i mean the discount is off way more than a single cent gthim i told you i want to use this card its money even if its just a penny its my money you cant expect to win the lottery if you just throw money away gtme i understand that sir unfortunately you have to use only cash or the store card to pay when you use an employee discount gthim why wont you take my money its still legal its a good penny gtme sir as much as i want to help you the register will not accept it gthim run it anyway oookay sometimes people just have to see the error message themselves i suppose i dutifully punch the keys he swipes the prepaid card and the register helpfully displays the cannot accept this payment with an employee discount message i turn the screen to show him and he looks even more angry gthim fine go back and take the employee discount off gtme sir i would be happy to do that for you but you understand that using the discount would save you more money you could just save the prepaid card and use it another time somewhere else gthim dont talk back to me just do it alright who am i to argue with such a pleasant request i go back and void the discount barcode then tell him his new total he angrily swipes the prepaid visa folds it in half and throws it over my head towards the trash can behind me classy gthim there was it that hard i just want to use my money you cant win the lottery you all know how this goes then he hands me the employee discount card again i stare at it then at him gthim well add the discount to the total now gtme sir i cant i told you the register wont let you use a discount card with payments that arent cash or the store card gthim well i used the stupid card already so now you can discount whats left gtme sir you see the discount card is a barcode i have to scan it back at the items screen which means in order to go back and add it again i need to void your prior payments thats why i warned you to save your prepaid card for another time and just use the discount instead he stares at me then stares over at the trash can where his now ruined visa sits gthim i cant believe i threw good money away anyway after all that he grumbled to himself a little finally paid in cash and left too bad hell never win the lottery now
so its just about closing time on a friday night at my store and as usual im the closing manager i dont know why this happens but we always get super busy in the last hour maybe its because people go out to eat then want to go somewhere and arbitrarily unfold things that they arent going to buy no telling at about minutes before close a group of teenagers come in all obnoxious and loud my associates and i kick on our amazing customer service skills and try to help them the hell out of the store before we close one girl finally picks a few items then comes up to the register to pay i jump on register and ring her up i tell her the total and it happens she holds up her iphone showing me a grainy picture of a credit card i have this she snottily says you can just type it in uhhhh im gonna need the actual card in the store i say my brain making sizzling popping noises in reaction to the situation that is beginning to transpire her nose wrinkles ive never seen this before in real life but i swear it wrinkles its my moms card and she said i can use it she says in a whiney voice so youre telling me that you expect to use a cellphone picture of someone elses card as payment i ask incredulously bratvoice uhhhhh yeeeeah she answers her voice doing that annoying upward lilt on the penultimate syllable thats not a valid form of payment i loudly pronounce her friends who have been tearing up the impulse items a few feet behind her get really quiet im going to need your mom physically in the store to complete the purchase unless you have money of your own she makes an even nastier face ugh she exclaims why will no one take this she stomps out her laughing friends following her out the door i quickly check my watch confirm that its exactly pm and lock it behind them i have no idea why anyone thought this would actually work 
when i was in high school i worked for a fast food burger chain one night i was working on the assembly table making burgers and my coworker was working the fryers i was doing some cleaning around keeping busy so that i wouldnt get sent home since it was a slow night then my manager steps out of the office and says guys you wont believe what this woman just called to complain about this is how he says the phone call went down manager fast food burgers how can i help you woman there was a used condom in my kids cheeseburger manager maam could you repeat that woman one of your employees put a used condom in my kids cheeseburger i opened it to take off the pickles and there was a used condom sitting there manager uhhhok ill see if anyone confesses to their crime please hold lets the phone sit on hold for a few mins because he knows shes lying manager maam my employees want to know if it was a magnum xl woman what no its not why would they ask that manager they want to let you know that its not it didnt belong to any of them woman your corporate office will be hearing about this click to this day theyre still waiting on that call from corporate edit holy shit i got gold for this thank you kind redditor for gifting my first gold edit i got tfr quote of the day you guys are awesome i dont know who decides that but thanks
i work at a coffee shop on campus at a bible college so my customers are bible college students a while back a girl comes to the register to order her drink i take her order and head into the kitchen to make it while im doing so i hear some change rattling and papers shuffling so i come back to register and this girl was taking money out of our tip jar when confronted she said well you shouldnt leave it here 
this happened last night and im so totally grossed out fuck okay so i work in a clothing store and my coworker was working in the fitting room i was called there to cover her for her i ask how many inside i just like to know how many to expect coming out of the fitting rooms she says three women and one man she leans in to whisper the man has been in so longi worry im like okay enjoy your break so about mins go by and the guy comes out hes short s and bald as a newborn his face is red and sweaty and i notice the clothes hes tried on are crumpled in a ball in his arms and im mildly annoyed as most customers dont bother putting the stuff back on the hangers anyway he gives me his number and high tails it out of there i untangle the clothes on the counter when my hand touches something wet thats when i screamed the clothes were covered in cum i guess he had been pleasuring himself while wearing the pants and the most fucked up part there was a little purple dress from the kids department at the center of the clothes with semen on the front i was kind of glad it was me who found it and not my coworker shes this tiny old lady who really would have freaked out i was disgusted i called my manager who is always calm in any situation she says what the fuck what the hell she called the cops and it turns out theres been a dude doing this all over the city the phantom cummer struck again edit for clarification when i say number im referring to the number paddles we give customers upon entering the fitting room if he had given me his phone number i obviously would have given it to the cops
ok so this isnt my story but my mums however i found it funny and wanted to share it so my mum m was on tills yesterday and her first customer was an elderly gentleman after processing the mans sale and receiving payment the customers wife came up to the till and noticed that he had bought something he shouldnt have mans wife you bought chocolate it is only the second of january and you have bought chocolate i cant believe you bought chocolate ill just get the girl to return this the man turned round and simply replied you had vodka yesterday if you can have vodka i can have chocolate edit spelling 
i just posted a story a few days ago but something today had me on the roflcopter so i just had to share this amazing employee fail i saw today so me and my coworker are up front as cashiers on a slow day we get a very pretty muslim girl and so my coworker tells me that he got this customer i let him take her and i continued to put away clothes that customers returned the next few things i heard were just unbelievable also just an fyi my coworker is one of those stereotypical douche bags who care too much about their muscleslooks is a hard core player cares more about his car than his relationships and is a total homophobic coworker cw hello there may i interest you in a rewards card her oh no thank you im just here to make a small purchase cw excuse me miss if you dont mind me asking as to why a beautiful girl like you is wearing one of those allah scarfs are those allah scarfs hip now you should take it off a beautiful girl like you shouldnt be wearing something like that i literally dropped everything just to turn around and hear what that girl was going to respond with her this allah scarf is called a hijab i wear it for religious reasons i also wear it so that men can like and respect me for who i am and not how i look also if you are trying to get with me youre wasting your time because i know i can do much better than you now if you will be so kind as to get your manager so that i my report your ignorance to him or her thank you my cw looked at me thinking i would help him out i actually left the front as soon as the manager came up went to the rest room and just laughed my ass off until my stomach got cramps he got fired on the spot edit changed islamic to muslim for correctness

apparently i have a story a day for you guys previous tales can be found and lets see how long i can keep finding things to post for you guys so im sick as all hell today im setting up the new merchandising layout for my store in between doing an inventory count and puking violently in the bathroom which is a second run down the hall while i had my head in the automatic flushing toilet i remembered something that happened one of the first times i ever opened my store by myself i had just finished an inventory count and i had a rather shady looking man come in to the kiosk now this in and of itself wasnt too out of the ordinary i was in a shady area before being transferred to the kiosk i now work at i was also hung over and i was pretty sure at that point i was dying it was about am and our store opened at am gtshady dude give me your phones gtme dude you gotta wait till were opened i cant just give you phones im not open yet half an hour gtshady dude no i want all of your phones now gtme still not cluing in yeah i get it you want phones you have to wait until my store is open just like everyone else gtshady dude now confused no give me your fucking phones gtme not with that attitude now fuck off im trying to open my store i think i confused the poor guy because he kinda just stood there until security and the cops showed up i guess one of the stores beside me realized what was going on and thought i was just stalling until someone called for help i honestly didnt even realize what was going on looking back on it now it terrifies me because that couldve turned out a lot different than it did i also kind of giggle because i think that thats the first time a hang over from hell mightve saved me
i worked in the electronics department of a major retailer however this particular retailer also included books and media as part of electronics this first part isnt the main story but the set up because only those who have had to maintain electronics and books know how rough it is even though its comparatively a small department keeping stuff like cds organized is a nightmare the true terror though is the kids book aisle for whatever reason kids hands are always sticky it doesnt matter if theyve just been washed theyre already sticky again and working in a large retail store parents tend to get so distracted by everything they dont always keep an eye on their kids or they just dont care what havoc their kid brings so im organizing the kids book section and this little kid is following right behind me undoing everything im doing the mom is talking loudly on her cellphone and cant be bothered to watch her kid pretty sure i saw him stick a lollipop in one book and pull another lollipop out of a different book not really but thats a theory as to why theyre always sticky so in the middle of what can best be described as the sisyphus of retail punishment i hear a man yell from ft away gt hey you hey im talking to you i figure its a guest yelling at another guest then i hear it again gt excuse you listen up and he snaps his fingers i finally look over and see what can best be described as a douchier version of guy fieri loud fat frosted tips wearing his oversized sunglasses in the store he snaps at me again and signals i come over to him henceforth hell be referred to as c so i put on my mask of friendliness and ask how i can help him gt me how may i help you gt c about time you got over here no wonder youre working here and not a real job i need one of them hmi mdi hdi mhd whatever they are gt me hdmi cables gt c yeah whatever i need one gt me four isles down on the left hand side normally im more than happy to show someone where they are but this kid back in the book section is missing his lollipop again and i see books on the floor gt c naw they aint there gt me alright lets go have a look and of course its fully stocked and there are multiple hooks full of cables also of note usually when someone came in to buy a cable id refer them either to a discount retail store in the same plaza or if they could wait id tell them to order online for way less this guy though he was paying gt me here you go one hdmi cable anything else gt c haha naw thisll be great for my new gaming console on my sweet new inch expensive brand plasma tv gt me oh game console you dont want that brand cable you want the one made by the manufacturer plus that one comes with a spare charging cable for a second controller i dont usually upsell useless stuff either its cheap garbage most of the time upsell total gt gt c oh sweet i only have one controller though gt me well this is a great chance to buy a second one gt c yeah i guess it is upsell total gt gt me this way you can play multiplayer in your favorite games gt c i dont think i have any of them gt me oh i can highly recommend this title i blindly point to the game case for the console he owns and hope for the best i ended up pointing to a popular basketball game that thankfully is multiplayer he agrees to buy it upsell total gt gt me its multiplayer up to four you said you only have one controller right if you want to make full use of this game id recommend having four controllers gt c yeah that sounds good upsell total gt gt me with charging cables upsell total gt at this point i figured hed have to break soon i wasnt even being subtle about tacking stuff on nope he purchased everything and i probably could have kept going but there was now a pile of kids books and it was shimmering with a coat of slime i knew would never come off 
first time posting here so i worked for a major fast food chain back in at it was my first actual job and i was so innocent but this is not a tale about the bad customers no those come later this is a tale of the best regular we had i worked on the front cash register and about once a week this older black man would come in around lunch and patiently wait until the crowd dispersed i cant recall exact conversations but he would always smile and ask how i was doing tell me i looked nice and just be very friendly and sweet after talking he would proceed to apologize before emptying his pockets of quarters and crumpled dollar bills and order a water value fries and a value burger my shift manager always gave him extra fries and something that was left behind small burger or nuggets usually whatever was going to be thrown out anyway because he was just an amazing person he always left his table clean and made sure to wish everyone a blessed day this man made my time there so much better and i do wonder sometimes what happened to him and wish i could have helped him more edit wow this got popular fast makes me feel good that the old man is getting the recognition thank you everyone for reading

background i work as an assistant manager at a large chicken fastfood chain while putting my way through med school i can only work parttime due to my studies but the company was great about letting me keep my job since ive been with them since high school the story one of our regular customers came in and i was sad to see his wife came with him this time i should note that he was a really great guy and a regular customer but we hated when his wife came with him because she was a queen bitch qb they got their chicken without incident i was training a new cashier when i heard a loud bang i looked over and saw the standing up with both hands on the table trying and failing to breathe hed apparently knocked over a chair i run over as fast as i can only to see his wife scoffing at him wtf and acting totally unconcerned well ive got an emergency medical responder license so i follow my training me sir are you choking the guy nods back but his wife shakes her head i ignore her again me i am going to perform abdominal thrusts maam please stand back a bit i move to go into position to do the thrusts which any idiot knows is the right thing to do this asshole woman grabs me and yells at me not to touch him qb hell be fine do not touch my husband well i could have explained why i had to touch him to her but the guy clearly was going into hypoxia i shoved her off of me and unfortunately she fell over a chair and landed on the ground i got behind her husband and did the thrusts while she yelled all sorts of profanities from the ground the chicken popped out and breathing resumed i walked over to help her up sorry maam but your husband needed immediate help qb thats bullshit he would have been fine lets get out of here honey the husband follows her as she storms out of the store and mouths thanks what the fuck well all my employees give me a pat on the back and say they were glad i was here cause they dont know anything about how to deal with that i decided then and there to get employees cpr certified but thats another story the epilogue to this story is that qb filled a complaint against me she came into the store the next day i had just gotten off shift and decided to do some studying in the back while i ate my free lunch im in the zone committing a particularly difficult transport path to memory when the manager comes in the manager brings me out front where my old friend qb is waiting manager qb here says that you knocked her over a chair is that true me yes sir it is but her husband was choking and i did save his life so qb interrupting save his life youre a college dropout working in fast food the fuck do you know my husband would have been fine and now ive got back pain from where i hit the chair me well maam my education is irrelevant but i do have a license to perform basic emergency medicine and i can tell you your husband would have certainly qb interrupting i dont care what you say you should be fired i want to file a complaint me sorry i saved your husbands life i just walked away and went back to the back room i grabbed my textbook went out to my car out the back and left the store the manager called me and told me they were going to investigate turns out i got to keep my job because the franchise owner is my buddy but i got a complaint in my personnel file and a warning i probably shouldnt have shoved her but come on it was the heat of the moment show a little gratitude lady update edit okay so ive talked to some people after reading the comments i didnt even think about the legal action so i am grateful to you all for bringing it to my attention as ujapaneseknotweed pointed out i definitely should not have shoved her even though it was more a reflex than anything else i phoned my emr instructor a trained paramedic and he said that in that circumstance he would have asked another employee to gently restrain her he reiterated scene safety but admitted that he probably would have done the same thing if he didnt have experience with stuff like this so often as far as legal action is concerned i called up a thirdyear law student i met at a grad school mixer yay top law and med school she mulled it over with a few other lawyersintraining over drinks tonight and the general consensus was that since the woman touched me first it was reflexive selfdefense and that coupled with the fact that she was interfering with legitimate medical aid by a licensed practitioner should mean im almost definitely okay as far as legal action against qb is concerned its a wash the law crew seems to think that she would have a defense because she was panicking and it would be hard to prove that she didnt think for some reason that i was trying to hurt her husband i havent seen her husband since the incident and some of these comments are making me a bit concerned i am going to talk to a social worker tomorrow when im at the hospital and see what they think i should do i should also note that while it isnt extremely common sometimes relatives do deny that their loved ones are hurt at all so she isnt necessarily emotionally abusive or coldly trying to collect life insurance the fact that she came in the next day still angry is the suspicious part thank you so much for the great comments

i worked part time in retail when i was a teenager at a large beautypharmacy chain here in the uk this particular branch i worked at had mains entrances set of automatic doors set of pushpull doors on the other side of the till and a little further up another automatic door that lead into the pharmacy usually when starting to close up wed keep the pharmacy doors to start to filter out customers so we could close on time the other sets of doors would be locked and wed move the large stands that hold customer baskets in front of them so people wouldnt go walking into them this almost always worked until one fine sunday afternoon it was about minutes before closing and barely anyone around so i just started doing a bit of tidying around the beauty department when i noticed a woman approached the pushpull doors she tried to open the door as it was locked she couldnt she then started aggressively wrestling with the door handle for a good minute whilst i watched until she spotted me and shouted you gonna let me in then or what you still have minutes until closing i can see the time from here this is illegal i approached the door and told her the second door down to the pharmacy is still open she can enter the store from there she looked at me with what i can only describe as a death stare and marched off in the direction of the pharmacy however this lady did not heed my advice instead she tried her luck at a shortcut and tried to walk into the automatic doors on the opposite side of the till still locked still with huge stands placed in front of them and walked straight into the glass smacking herself square in the face eventually finding her way to the pharmacy to she started screaming i only came here for one thing but i have found you are conducting illegal activity and ive just been assaulted to which my manager who saw everything calmly replies madam it is not illegal to lock entrances when we still keep one open its simply to help us close on time and i dont think you were assaulted crazy lady shouts i dont care what the fuck its for i worked in retail for years i know how it fucking works you need to be sacked love you havent got a fucking clue have you im here for one thing and i want it now manager and what is that crazy lady practically throws film canisters and my manager and says i need these pictures developed and i need them ready for tomorrow or i will be contacting head office to tell them that you need to be fired ok manager smuglyohh im sorry madam our photo lab is closed on sundays youll need to come back tomorrow crazy lady starts to breathe heavily giving my manager that death stare shed given me earlier before exploding i want my fucking pictures if i wanted to come in on another day i fucking would why cant you do your fucking job this is ridiculous at this point our store security guard steps in grabs the woman by the arm and begins marching her out the store as shes leaving i can hear her shouting this is assault you are assaulting me someone help im being assaulted by this man tldr crazy woman walks into a door then accuses said door and security guard of assaulting her 
this may be my favorite thing that has ever happened while working and i figure this best place to share it is with you all be me weird girl i work as an overnight manager at everyones favorite fast food place i normally work pmam or for all you military enthusiasts this means that not only do i get the idiot stoned teenagers i get the early morning coffee crowd between i rarely see any new faces one of my regulars lets call him red comes in every morning for a coffee and a burrito super nice guy one of my favorites another regular who ill call splenda is a very sweet lady who comes through every morning at about the same time yesterday red asked to pay for the car behind himunusual and it happened to be splenda being am she was caught of guard but told me to say thank you when i saw him next fast forward to this morning and splenda is in front of red she asks to pay for the car behind her i cant help but laugh and tell her that its the same guy who paid for her they both loved the coincidence and everyone ended up with a slightly brighter morning 
i work in a mall restaurant and we offer a pizza pasta amp salad buffet during lunch hours that is popular it cost about somewhat standard price where im from most people buy either the buffet or their favorite meal amp thats that then we have the kids meals sides amp small meals one of the small meals is just a slice of pizza salad amp a drink at about its overpriced for one slice of pizza think th of a family pizza amp extra slices are each but you really aint supposed to buy multiple pieces on their own you just get the buffet instead i was still kind of new amp this day a mother shows up with her two teenagers one of em grabs a burger with fries amp mom amp the other kid gets the buffet everything is just fine until dad shows up about minutes later since he showed up way after the rest of the family i had no clue that he belonged to that group amp after quickly looking over the menu he told me he wanted slices of pizza amp a coke i asked if he wanted salad with the slices amp was about to continue telling him that the buffet was a better option if he wanted more than slices when he just snaps at me that he wants slices and a drink nothing else okay fine thats for almost no food at all but thats what he wants he pays amp leaves with his food after joining his family at the table amp finishing his food he apparently finds out that they only payed for an all you can eat buffet while he overpayed for his food as you can guess he came back with all the receipts being even more irritated than before he accused methe restaurantthe owners of scamming people out of money by making them overpay for something they could get cheaper and i tried telling him that i would have sold him the buffet but that he demanded to get the pizza pieces only amp that i was prepared to refund him the difference between the orders amp he could continue to eat from the buffet until satisfied this was still not to his satisfaction this is when his wife joined us amp intervened she took one look at me and then turned to her husband interrupting his rant xxxx when you ordered did you listen to her the first time or did you just tell her what you wanted did you even read the menu properly he proceeds to tell her that he indeed just asked for the specific slices amp that he did not look on the menu because he wanted pizza but that it was still a scam demanding so much money amp that i should be ashamed for going through with the order at this point his wife has an annoyed look on her face amp i brace for a double barrage of criticism amp complaint about the food you need to stop yelling at the poor girl she did exactly what you told her to do its your own fault you stupid fuck what that is the actual quote of what she said i am in no doubt that both me amp the husband looked completely gobsmacked she proceeded to turn around amp walk away leaving us standing there her husband glanced at me amp then just left without uttering another word 
i worked at a technology bigbox store for several years mostly in sales but i spent my time behind the returns desk eventually it wasnt as much fun but having all the product experience meant that i was very much aware of how the product was supposed to work anyways a woman comes in with a printer and receipt thankfully insisting that the printer didnt work she was well within her return policy so that wasnt a big problem but we did need to test it after all its harder to sell opened merchandise and if the product did work maybe she wouldnt return it so i start getting everything out of the box while i ask what the problem was gtit didnt turn on ah weve narrowed the problem down to bad cord bad printer or doing it wrong at least i didnt have to connect it to a computer to test its printing abilities or hook it up to wifi by now everythings out of the box printer on the table and im rooting around under the table to plug the cord in suddenly the customer chimes in gtwhat are you doing gtim looking for a place to plug it in gtwhy gtwell it needs to be powered to turn on gtno it doesnt its wireless
background i work in a small specialty backpackingoutdoor store we carry a variety of highend brands and are located near a fairly wealthy community generally this means we have very little issues with bad customers but we do get some crazies occasionally this tale takes place last weekend as per usual the store was packed and my manager and i were working the registers to get through the line that had formed cue disgruntled man with a return in managers line gtmanager hey how are you today gtdisgruntled man id like to return this throws backpacking pillow on counter gtmanager lets see here do you have your receipt gtdisgruntled man no just do the return starting to get agitated at our little store we have some pretty lenient return policies for our size of store it sums up to days from purchase in newlike new condition with no damage or use and with the original packaging and a receipt this is for all merchandise excluding food and climbing equipment we also can add customers into our system to keep record of their purchases if they are prone to losing receipts gtmanager remaining as calm as ever well sir i do need a receipt to process any returns are you in our system gtdisgruntled man causing a scene and half shouting something about privacy government spying and the like i was too busy the hear what it was gtdisgruntled man ill just take store credit was never offered to him gtmanager unfortunately i cant accept this back at all i dont have any record you purchasing this here the packaging is damaged and is also the wrong packaging for this pillow it smells like campfire and is covered in wood chips the store is now silent all eyes and ears are focused on this guy and manager a pin could drop and you wouldnt hear it because you were too focused on these two gtdisgruntled man what wood chips i dont see any flicks off the wood chips towards manager gtmanager the wood chips you just flicked at me now unless there was something wrong with the pillow that would justify a warranty claim im going to have to ask you to step aside for other customers gtdisgruntled man yes there is something wrong the pillow is terrible i groan in my mind i understand that manager said that just to get him away from the registers but the warranties are never handled by us they go straight to the manufacturer this will likely piss off disgruntled man even more but shockingly disgruntled man complies and fills out a warranty form and lists some nonsensical issue with the pillow in true anticlimatic fashion disgruntled man leaves in peace and were stuck with a pillow and a warranty form at least i dont have to call him when the manufacturer rejects his claim that is managers job
so if a customer gets upset or yells or demands their effing fries just do what evan did take a breath calm down and inquisitively ask who told you it was ok to talk to someone like that youll get a dumbfounded look without actually saying anything of repercussion 
working in big box retail has yielded me some amazing stories some involve unruly customers most involve black friday and a few result in some hilarious attempts to steal shit in the store youve all been in big box stores so ill describe this ones layout remember dont guess youbanistan is not a fun place to visitthey dont have cookies or milk at all the layout at the time was that your pcs televisions appliances and all the big ticket items were on the outside of the main floor we had a white and black walkway that was a gigantic square which wrapped around the store and separated the big ticket stuff from the smaller items in the center inside the center were cameras cell phones and most importantly shelves upon shelves of cds dvds video games etc middle of the week in this store was boring as hell most of us kept ourselves entertained on our earpiece radios by playing guessing games and commenting on the mullets that came into the store and even giving a rating by referring to them as code m which would prompt about ten employees to start looking at the department our lp guy was a good friend of mine and at with a hilarious sense of humor the store tended to be more fun when he was watching the cameras up front on this day however we got our entertainment from a short woman who decided she was going to try and rob us blind it was a little cool outside but nothing overbearing as it was early spring this woman however had come in wearing extremely heavy and somewhat baggy pants a winter jacket sunglasses kept them on indoors and a heavy sweater underneath it wasnt a minute before she was in the dvds and already frantically looking around and just acting sketchy my friend at lp well call him alex hits me up on the earpiece alex hey man can you wander over by this woman in dvds and see what the hell she is doing me yeahwhy is she acting strange alex oh yeah she did a triple take at one of the cameras i have locked on to her me wow why is she bundled up like its below outside alex thats why i want you to watch her i set up camp about three aisles diagonally from her and actually had a good view sure enough this woman grabs a bunch of the cheap dvds that werent in security cases looks around and stuffs them down her pants me you catch that on camera alex yep already calling the police now just keep locked onto her she wasnt content there she made a few stops along the way stopping at the xbox section the blurays and the ps games hey at least she wasnt a fanboy of one system or the other thieves apparently dont discriminate she spent the next ten minutes or so walking around to make it seem like she was just browsing at this point there are four of us basically watching her from a distance while we wait for the police who showed up in the form of two cruisers outside one was set up in the parking lot the other pulled up alongside the front of the building just away from the entrance alex went out to greet him where the officer was outside stretching and limbering up alex why are you stretching sir officer i hope she runs i need a workout meanwhile back in the store our little thief had caught on to the fact that she was being watched the entire time and was putting the cheap dvds back in a different spot than the belonged once she did that even though she still had plenty of other things she loudly announced to everyone as she made for the exit i put everything back dont you all dare touch me you fucking pricks oye some people just dont get it do they of course the alarm goes off when she hits the exit and bolts right past alex as hes coming back into the building now store rules for us meant that once she was outside the store we couldnt chase her however officer workout was ready and sure as shit she took off the moment she saw the cruiser we would find out later that the officer used to play safety for a division three college nearby which wasnt a shock as he performed a beautiful formfitting tackle on her in the middle of the parking lot you know the type im talking about getting her from behind lifting her completely off her feet but making sure that he set her back down on the feet like you would in football warmups when practicing tackling form no injuries no blood just getting the thief the best line of the day though came from the officer after he brought her back in for us to show her the security tape and to fill out our official paperwork on her he heads out of the office and comes over to us giving us his direct phone number officer seriously guys just call me next time and not dispatch i love this shit tldr woman decides to steal shit from store finds out that officer was exfootball player and knows how to tackle
background i work at an internationally recognized convenience storegas station in a small but economically diverse city and as such our store gets a wide variety of patrons story our store is smack dab in the center of my city and as such local law enforcement love to stop by because we offer free coffee and soda whenever they need no questions asked however tonight i was working on my own for a little bit while i waited for my coworker to come relieve me i saw a police cruiser pull up and thought nothing of it a minute later a lady comes in from the gas pump and asked if she could use the restroom i direct her to end of the store where our singular customer restroom is and remind her to bring the key in with her because if not then someone could walk in on her a few minutes pass and then the officer from the parked police cruiser walks inside i greet him as i do everyone else and he ignores me and walks straight to the back of the store where the restroom is ill be me hell be apm or angry police man gtme im sorry sir i believe theres a woman in there right now gtapm no there isnt if there was shed have taken the key with her of course this bitch left the key hanging off the door i usually dont play bathroom monitor but i knew with certainty that she was still in there because she was the only person besides the officer whod be in the store for the past ten minutes or so gtme no im pretty sure shes in there i just heard her flush gtapm yeah right kid so apm ignores my warning and proceeds to burst open the bathroom door of course the woman is still on the toilet with her pants around her ankles and all i hear is gtshut the fucking door yeah you really showed me how its done maybe next time hell listen before he goes barging in
now lets just set the mood of this tale it was our busiest time of the day we had a moderate sized line and we were low on workers it was an incredibly stressful time and now let us begin i work at a local ice cream store and right around in the afternoon we get a slight rush no the number of customers isnt unbearable but it is enough to keep you on your feet so sample lady and her family walk in all excited to get their ice cream they had never been to our store so the workers are encouraged to be extra nice to these customers first off sample lady is not an attractive lady at all she is missing half of her teeth and is not the thinnest person on the planet a slight scent of fecal matter surrounds her and her shoes have massive holes in them yes this has nothing to do with the story but it will help you get a mental image of how i was attempting to serve this lady sample lady then proceeds to ask for a sample of a few different flavors not a problem at all until she says heck i will just try them all to figure out what i want oh goodness so the process begins in our store we have different flavors of ice cream out at one time and are encouraged to give as many free samples as the customer wants so beginning at one end of the store and making our way towards the other more and more customers begin to file into our store sample lady is still sampling when we have over customers behind her asking for my personal opinion on each flavor when we finally finished our journey sample lady get this still doesnt know what she wants so not only did i just waste a literal halfhour serving her samples but i am having to wait on her to choose what she wants by this time all of sample ladys family has ordered and have now completely finished their ice cream sample ladys daughter approaches her mother and says hey mom were all done with ours realizing that she is holding up a line and her family sample lady leaves she leaves the store she doesnt even order anything i have yet to see sample lady again
so i used to work as a cashier at a retail store as im walking around my aisle straightening up merchandise a lady and her son are waiting in line at a checkout line not mine the son has on a pair of heelysshoes with small wheels in the heels and is running up and down in front of the checkout lanes as fast as possible then rolling on his heelys now the mom seemed like an incredibly soft spoken individual and was softly saying things like ltsons namegt please come herestop doing that etc etc the kid was having none of it completely disregarding his mom like she wasnt even there i can see the mom getting irritated and finally she snaps and yells ltsons namegt get over here right now kid just responds with an equally as loud no and proceeds to take off on another sprint right across from the checkout lanes are shopping aisles and this kid decided to run a little closer to that side this time as to avoid his mom as he rode by her cue a little old lady pushing her cart from behind one of those aisles the kid doesnt even have time to put his hands up before he smacks face first into this cart it had some heavy stuff in there because this kid was moving and the cart barely moved at all as he facebounced off and landed flat on his back it was something that should have been in a stooges film the carts were the plastic ones with the small diamond shaped patterns and the kid came running back to mommy crying hysterically with a red imprint of the cart on his face 
okay here goes a gentleman comes into our store last night gets a few groceries and goes to self checkout as hes there his light starts blinking so i go over he is using a one day pass that allows you to shop without a membership but charges you a surcharge he says he would like me to override the surcharge so he doesnt have to pay it gt me im sorry sir but i cant do that gt guy but i have my membership card right here he pulls out his wallet and shows it to me then kind of sheepishly he says gti just dont want this showing up on my purchase history i take a closer look at his screen the only item he is purchasing is a ct box of condoms and hes paying cash oh ohhh none of my business so professionally as you please i offer to help him gt me well i cant override the surcharge but i can refund it to you after your purchase will that work gtguy yes thank you that will work just fine so he finishes up with the condoms and then rings his groceries through separately and then comes up to my counter to get his refund which i give him with a smile on my face and tell him to have a good night hah afterwards my lp manager comes over to ask what i just did because it looked a little suspicious so i told her bless her heart this little old lady burst out laughing and said something about being wild and crazy in her younger days some days i really love my job
just after i graduated highschool i worked as a page for the local library i know that pushes the ragged edge of retail but we had customers and really what is a library but a book store that doesnt understand economics we had some regulars in the library some were kids from the highschool across the street whose parents used as a substitute daycare and others were grownass men who spent their entire days in a public library it takes all kinds this is a story about mr meerkat the worst of our regulars every day from open to close mr meerkat would be there he had a study booth that he always took one in the back where nobody could see him he earned his distinctive name from the fact that he would stand up every couple of minutes to see if anyone was approaching him now i have no place judging strange people it happens of the billion people on the planet there are gonna be some anomalies mr meerkat had a bigger problem though he hid things we didnt have any cameras so we were never able to prove it because everyone knew he had a big problem with president obama fair enough and the american left in general also fair enough but we would see him with say dreams from my father and a month later we would find it stuffed in a corner under a stack of magazines hed also remove the new yorker and hide the localgaynewspaper this has been going on for years hes just clever enough and county government employees are just apathetic enough that nothing has been done about it enter the all seeing eye i was working two jobs at the time the library and an internship at a local tech company i was doing hour days every day at the tech place and days i worked at the library were generally hours after two months of this i was an exhausted angry mess i spot him sitting away from his usual space holding a copy of freakonomics not reading just sitting watching me i know whats coming and duck behind and aisle to watch him fool thinks i cant see him he jams the book between the stuffed chair he was in and the wall and walks off my sleep deprived brain snaps and i head over grab the book he hid and tap him on the shoulder sauron sir you forgot your book meerkat no i didnt ltshrugging with palms facing ceilinggt s sir dont think i dont know what youve been up to it makes my job harder i dont like it when you make my job harder please cease before it becomes a problem i lay the book in his palm and walked off without a backwards glance at my beaten foe edit i cant spell edit the nd wow quote of the day thank you all for making my sophomore slump completely unavoidable
this happened back several months ago in the beginning months of the year we were having our morning huddle when a customer walked in one of our managers saw him greeted him and this follows gtc i didnt realize i was late for the meeting gtm joking what no coffee and doughnuts gtc i didnt realize it was my day to bring them gtm thats okay well forgive you this time so a day or two later he comes back in to our morning huddle bringing a couple boxes of doughnuts and like a gallon of coffee from a local coffee shop i know we bitch and complain about customers but this was the one instance that a customer was really awesome and made all of our days
ive been working in a groceryclothinggeneral merchandise retailer for about four years mostly i work up at the customer service desk which entails printing up money orders processing wire transfers selling all the tobacco products cashing out lottery and primarily returns and exchanges a year or so ago during a slower part of the day a man probably in his midlate s comes up to me at the desk with an xbox to return he said that he bought it a couple weeks prior which was true as he had his receipt still and i checked the date for his son who decided that he wanted a ps instead he said that they already purchased a ps somewhere else and he just needed to return the xbox unfortunately even with a receipt gaming consoles in addition to all computer software and hardware cds dvds video games etc are nonrefundable once theyve been opened ive always thought that this policy was completely reasonable especially since my store only deals in brand new products not used and we cant ship it back to the manufacturer unless there is some kind of manufacturers defect which in this case there was not i calmly explained to him that once a console has been opened we can do nothing but exchange it for an identical product and thats only in the case of a defect he scowls at me and demands a manager fine awesome i can see where this is going and i dont get paid enough to deal with the brewing storm of attitude so i call up the electronics manager and he comes over to talk to the customer the customer explains that he doesnt want the xbox anymore and wants his money back in return the electronics manager disclosed our return policy basically verbatim for what i said he demands a different manager this time much much louder wow okay so i give my direct manager a call and ask her to come over she comes over gets the spiel from the customer about how he wants his goddamn money back and how were stealing from him by not giving him a refund she asks the electronics manager who is still standing up here what our policy is he informs her she looks at the customer and says something like sorry this is our policy if theres anything else we can do for you please just ask hostile the man explodes yelling and screaming about how he doesnt want this fucking thing and its ours and we have to take it back there was some more screaming about how were dirty thieves and were stealing money from him and how its illegal lots of yelling i called the store director the bosss bosss boss he gets paid enough to deal with this bullshit the director who is actually a completely rational cool dude comes up and after patiently listening to this guys ranting for about minutes gives him the same answer that hes gotten from the rest of us dont you love it when your managers back you up after youve said no to an asshole customer this is the last straw for unhappy customer guy he claims that if we arent going to do something for him hes calling the police to arrest us all for theft yep theft im stoked to see if he does and apparently the managers are too so they tell him that he is free to call the police if he wants to dude picks up his cellphone calls his lawyer or at least claims to and leaves a message detailing the situation apparently his lawyer didnt have time in the middle of a work day to answer a call from one of her clients he makes a second call to the oclock news he wants everyone to know how shitty undisclosed retailer treats their customers and screams at us about how well all be out of jobs and that no one will ever shop here again its a nationwide chain bro im pretty sure were going to be fine but thanks he makes a final call to the police they were the only ones to answer the fucking phone hah he says that the customer service bitch from retailer has stolen hundreds of dollars from him and is being backed up by all her dumbass managers hes screaming at the cops over the phone im almost surprised that the police didnt hang up on him but i mean they are the cops i dont think they can legally hang up on anyone whos dialed it takes the cops about minutes to show up during which time my managers have gone back to their jobs and im filing away some paperwork and this crazy dude has plopped himself on the floor in front of my desk having some kind of sit it or something every time another customer starts heading my way he yells and screams at them dont shop here they steal your money bunch of fucking thieves im fine with this its hilarious he looks like a bridge troll and i have paperwork to catch up on eventually the police show up and the dude brings them over to me and has the most smug look on his face it wont last he declares to the nice officers that i took his money and refused to give it back which obviously puzzles them as im a fucking employee and covered by like five cameras at all times i clarify that i didnt take anything from him he bought an xbox a couple weeks back opened it up and played it then wanted to return it i also explained our return policy to them i showed them the copy of this policy which was hanging by my desk by the desk that the xbox was purched at on our website and on his receipt i can tell that the poor cops are just dreading dealing with this guy but they give him an ultimatum he can either not get a refund from us and go home not get a refund and go to jail angry customer id rather go to jail then let these fuckers win im not leaving without my money i dont think he was getting it so the cops handcuff him and start heading towards the door when i realize that his xbox is still sitting on the counter i grab it and run after them me wait sir you left your merchendise at the counter one of the cops takes it from me me have a wonderful day sir thank you for shopping at retailer im pretty sure he would have strangled me if he hadnt been handcuffed haha tldr dumbass customer calls the cops on himself and its ever so sweet
hello rtalesfromretail im a longtime lurker who thought its about time i shared with you some of my delightful experiences with customers i have had working for one of the uks biggest telecommunication companies having worked there for quite some time now i am pretty much a vet and if theres two things the job has taught me its that if youre not speaking to people face to face they will show you just how repugnant they can be and that some peoples entitlement knows no bounds i work by a simple adage i work in customer service i provide customers with a service i am not a customer servant anyway onto the tale i am sitting at my desk browsing rtalesfromretail when i glance at my countdown timer wearily i lift my headset and sign into my phone as the countdown reaches zero i smile to trick myself into thinking im going to be able to sustain a modicum of happiness until the end of my shift my final break is already a distant memory and now i face the slog through

hey there tfr im a longtime lurker and i didnt really have anything worthwhile to post until now also it should be noted that i dont technically work in retail but i do work in customer service i dont know if that excludes me from posting but i hope not anyway a little background i work at the headquarters of a particular states police force and i am the guy in charge of fingerprinting all civilians on average i fingerprint about people a day most of these encounters are short sweet and forgettable this one time however was not at about am a larger woman in a red dress comes in and immediately takes a seat which granted is odd as they usually come up to me or go up to a nearby window to ask questionssee if they need to check in or whatever however it does happen i finish fingerprinting the person i am on and politely ask the woman if she is there to be fingerprinted or if shes looking for another office people get lost here its a big building she tells me she is not being fingerprinted and asks if its okay to just park a seat for a while sure whatever it doesnt bother me any i continue fingerprinting people at approximately a young woman of mexican descent comes in usually i wouldnt mention the ethnicity but i feel its important in this instance as this woman hardly speaks a lick of english its fine i pantomime which fingers i need and we get her fingerprinted rather quickly she then thanks me and goes to the window to ask for information about something else not sure what i had other customers to deal with about rolls around and she goes to the window a second time and this time i hear her ask about an escort now this is odd as no one asks for an escort the woman behind the window offers to get her manager and walks away at which point the woman comes to me and asks me if i could escort her because shes afraid now i have to explain that i am not the kind of guy youd immediately go to for an escort im not an actual officer im just a clerk essentially im wearing a sweater vest im a tall guy but quite wiry and couldnt hold my own if push came to shove im not supposed to leave my post except for scheduled breaks i try to explain this to the woman but she isnt really getting much of it i try to get her to wait until an actual police officer shows up to help her but she refuses saying frantically that she has to leave now because that woman is watching her now this is the first mention of why she needed an escort so i attempt to pry more information out of her she explains in broken english that the large woman in red has been watching her the whole time giving her devils eyes and whispering things under her breath and shes scared she might be attacked i look over to see if the woman in red is doing such things but shes gone and the woman before me frantically explains that shes waiting out in the hallway trying to catch her as she leaves and attack her i dont believe her but i pretend i do i try to calm her down and check my watch seeing that its been quite a few minutes and no police officer has shown up yet i have customers waiting finally i break down and agree to escort her out of the building i quickly apologize to my waiting customers and then i walk out with the woman the hallway is as i expected completely clear of the woman in red as we hastily walk towards the elevators her out of fear me out of the need to get people fingerprinted the woman in red steps out of a bathroom door in front of us blocking us off the scared woman scurries behind me hoping that my thin body will protect her it wont but i stand firm the red woman hisses and i do not use this verb lightly she legitimately sounded like she was trying to pull of her best anaconda impression i know what you are i point to myself me no not you she spits once again i use this literally as some spittle flew in an arc from her mouth that thing behind you the woman behind me lets out a little moan of terror the red woman continues do you have any idea what that thing is that creature youre protecting ive worked retail before so i know how to calm people down or at least thats what i tell myself so i said maam i do know who she is shes a very scared young woman and im taking her to the front door no the red woman shouts shes a demon an ally of the adversary this causes me to blink now ive dealt with some crazies in my time both at retail and when i worked at a pool which is another story in and of itself but i had never never experienced something like this and quite frankly i didnt know how to handle the situation the young woman behind me was pulling on my sweater vest and begging me to move i too desperately wanted to move but in order to get to the elevators or the stairs wed have to shove past the red woman instead i tried to calm the woman down maam i dont know who you think this woman is who she shrieked cutting me off it is not a who but a what and what it is is a demon a creature like her ruined my family and i wont let her do something like that to another family the woman behind me shrieked again for me to move and this time i did realizing that there was absolutely no dealing with the red woman i began walking quickly with my long legs i can cover ground very quickly and with the woman now in tears clinging onto me i pushed past the woman in red and going towards the elevators and the stairs do you know what kind of evil you are aiding the red woman boomed as i rushed by do you not know that by aiding it you are also partaking in its evil ways i know it looks like a mere woman to you but its not thats how it deceives you i ignored her and made for the stairs knowing that the elevator wouldnt be ready in time i knocked open the large metal door and together the crying woman and i rushed down the stairs me taking them two at a time her clinging to me for dear life above us the woman in red began shouting down at us what sounded like a prayer ripped straight from the exorcist or one of its many sequels full of a great deal of begones and i banish thees i ignored them as best i could and rushed down the five floors of stairs and into the main lobby in the lobby are several uniformed officers at all times to run security and help visitors find their way around and so forth i rushed over to one of these officers and explained the situation as best i could because the poor woman behind me was a terrified blubbering mess and couldnt communicate her feelings to save her life i could tell that part of him didnt believe a word of it and frankly i didnt believe much of it myself of course he did believe when the red woman stepped out of the elevators and made a beeline towards us the crying woman shrieking at the sight of her the red woman her eyes narrowed and her cheeks red from exertion began to start in on another prayer screaming at the top of her lungs in the middle of the lobby at this poor woman the officer immediately called for backup as he tried to diffuse the situation desperately trying to do what i had done and make the woman in red calm down instead it seemed he only began to make her angrier as her prayers became louder and more desperate a crowd was beginning to form stunned faces surrounded us as a two more officers appeared and began to separate the woman two ended up dragging the red woman away to calm her down and get her side of the story the original officer questioned me again and tried to get the poor crying woman to calm down however it didnt work eventually the red woman was escorted out of the building one officer on either side of her on the way out she just glared at the poor little woman who continued to hide behind me until a few minutes later another officer appeared and escorted her to her car the original officer then turned to me and asked what the hell was that i dont know officer i dont know bewildered i returned to my desk only to discover that i had customers waiting to be fingerprinted all of them were agitated at me for making them wait so long i had to work through my lunch break to get caught up aftermath i wish i could tell you what happened after the fact but the truth is i dont know i havent seen either of the women for over a week and i have only bumped into the officer once since and just laughed and gave a small head shake when he saw me upon coming home after work that day i told the story to all of my friends and only one believed me and thats only because he had worked for the state and as he put it dude some really weird shit goes on in state offices i have to agree with him
i dont work at this store but i thought you guys might like this story anyway i was in line the other night at a certain popular overpriced grocery in the nicer area of town behind a very pretty middle aged asian lady and as she was checking out the guy in front of her a slightly balding redhead wearing a very nice suit was standing at the bagging area trying to convince her to have drinks with him that night he was complimenting her looks asking if she was single and such she seemed a little embarrassed but eventually smiled and agreed the cashier was all excited and encouraging her on as well after i was finished checking out i walked to my car and they were putting their groceries into the same car and chatting very obviously husband and wife at that point at first i had thought he was being a little forward and bugging her a bit but seeing that it was her husband playing at picking up his dream girl at the grocery it was really really sweet 
browsing tfr has made me remember all sorts of stories i never got around to posting this happened midnovember i was cashiering as always at grocery store a very cute little kid was sitting in the main basket of his adults cart unpacking her groceries for her im just taking things as they come down and packing them up mostly tuning out the interaction between the boy and the woman with him finally im waiting on the last item as hes trying to fish it out of the cart he drops it on the belt one single bulb of garlic in a plastic bag it comes down the belt toward me and he says the single cutest thing ive ever heard a small child say much to the delight of the other customers in line and the cashier in the register behind me small child waves to the garlic bye baby pumpkin this marks one of the very few times a child was more cute than a complete nuisance in my store i do have a few other cute kid shortstories i could share though

so i was talking to a co worker and found out that we both used to frequent the same hour diner he shared this story with me and i thought id share with you so my friend and his friends went to this diner and were sat next to a very large woman probably about five foot nothing and around pounds and her very skinny boyfriend also shes really drunk so big fat drunk lady bfdl demands that her boyfriend give her a dollar she wants to play the claw machine she walks over to the claw machine and drops the dollar when she bends over to pick it up her too small sweat shorts dissapear into her butt my friend described it as the largest grossest most pock marked and cellulite ridden cottage cheese ass you have ever seen so that is pretty gross after trying and failing the claw machine bfdl disappears around the corner for a few minutes she comes back just as her food gets to the table but along with the waitress two cops walked up to the table the cops say maam some of the other patrons said that they saw you take four dollars from a table that they left as a tip bfdl immediately starts yelling and cursing at the officers oh hell no thats bullshit she pulls some neatly folded twenties in a money clip from one pocket as shes screaming she pulls from the other pocket four crinkled ones this hear is my money i found it she yells as shes trying to smooth out the money then she realizes what she said and changes her story no i brought these from home this is my money finally the officers have had enough and they say that shes going to have to come with them bfdl screams no picks up her plate of food and smashes it against the wall at this point she goes under the table and comes back up eating a piece of food that hit the floor the officers lead her out in cuffs at this point as shes screaming and spraying food chunks everywhere the super skinny boyfriend who has not said a single word at this point looks at his food lets out a long deep sigh and says man she has the keys tldr she had the keys edit i cant spell

as a gas station clerk most of my customers understand that gas price changes are governed by forces far outside my control yes i physically change the price in the computer and on the sign outside but i dont have any say in the how and when when the price is going up we change the sign before we change it on the pumps when the price is going down we do the opposite this way during the short amount of time when the sign and pumps display different prices the sign is always higher this way people who see the sign from the road are never paying more than they expect to its important to do it this way so that people cant accuse us of false advertising in theory heres what happened all the gas stations around us were going up by like and we were due to raise our prices along with them because we were among the last to change we were swamped with people trying to fill up their cars before the price hike finally its time to raise our prices i grab the numbers for the sign and go outside for the walk of shame same routine as always i dont make eye contact with anyone certainly there are customers glad to see they just made it in time but i dont necessarily trust some of my elderly customers to have a full grasp of the situation they just see a guy raising the gas price im trying to use body language to convey i only work here i change the sign walk back in and change the price on the pumps via the computer i think the moment of mild anxiety is over nope within seconds an old woman throws open the door gtold lady did you just raise the gas price gtme yes gtold lady thats false advertising your sign says xxx gtme im sorry but the sign says xxx i changed it before i changed it on the pumps gtold lady your sign said xxx thats why i drove here gtme im sorry you mustve just missed it we change the sign first so that people dont pay more than they think theyre going to gtold woman but you changed it right as i was fueling the sign said xxx when i pulled in gtme did you begin fueling before the price change if you did you get the lower price it doesnt go up in the middle of a transaction gtold lady i i mean no but i was here you cant change the price on me before i start filling up so she was just slow unfortunately there really is no recourse i cant do anything about the situation gtme im sorry she stammers a bit turns and walks out this happened a few months ago and i still joke about it with my coworkers hey i was able to raise the price without getting yelled at by any old ladies tldr title says it all

briefly before my husband started working freight he was a train conductor for several years because of that he was very familiar with the laws and statutes that applied to the railway ok so my husband was a supervisor at the train yarddock where freight was unloadedloaded for a major shipping company despite being a supervisor he was very hands on they were understaffed and his two best workers were a narcoleptic and an albino who always had to take breaks to get out of the sun one day he gets called over because somehow a customer had gotten the phone number for the dock to this day he has no clue how they got it it was an older gentleman who was impatiently waiting for delivery on a very large package my husband was polite checked the tracking and verified that it would be unloaded in a few hours picked up sent to the warehouse loaded into a delivery truck and he would have it first thing tomorrow the man was not happy my husband verified his expectant delivery date was the following day but this man wanted to drive down to the train dock to pick it up himself this violated about a million company rules and several railway laws my husband explained that nonemployees were strictly forbidden on the property they didnt have the proper equipment to load the package into a private vehicle etc the man went from not happy to pissed really quickly after yelling at my husband for several minutes my husband simply hung up hes not a people person and customer interaction was far from his job duties before he left the phone rang again so he picked up and the pissed customer informed him that his grandson was coming to pick up the item and hed like to see my husband stop him because he was a cop again my husband hung up about min later a squad car pulled up security had let him thru because who wants to puss a cop off he approached my husband asked if he was the man who kept hanging up on his grandfather and my husband replied yes that was me i dont know how your grandfather got the number here but we dont do customer service here and its impossible for him to get his item right now if he wants to call the warehouse and make arrangements to pick it up once its there hes welcome to like grandfather like grandson cop was pod he starts telling my husband he will be handing over the item blah blah blah again my husband explained how it violated company policy and having a nonrailway employee on the property was also a nono for safety reasons the cop wasnt having any of it and began demanding to know exactly where the package was my husband explained it was in a freight car waiting to be unloaded with the other largest items of the shipment at this point the cop began demanding to be taken to the freight car my husband had enough officer this is private property your presence here without just cause or a warrant is ridiculous and you could risk the safety of my crew this train needs to be out of here by a certain time because we have other trains coming in today and frankly youre stalling the whole process just by being here the cop was quick to retort you have my grandfathers property youre not handing it over id say that possession of stolen property is just cause to be here knowing company rules my husband replied when your grandfather had his item shipped thru our company he automatically agreed to our rules this process is one of them and you cant steal something from someone who has yet to take possession of it he cop threatened berated etc my husband saw that most of his guys had stoppedslowed working to watch the show and they really did have another train on its way so my husband needed to clear this up fast and get back to work he told the cop ok ok ill take you too it the cop smugly followed as my husband escorted him to the freight car now im not sure what this man had shipped but according to my husband the package was not only huge but very heavy so you just gonna throw this in your squad car the package was a little less then half the size of a car the cop looked confused for a second and said im leaving to get my neighbors flat bed when i get back youre gonna help me load it my husband shook his head we dont have the equipment for that and anyone here who helps will be fired besides this borders in theft since were responsible for the item until its signed for the cop retorted you will help or ill make sure everyone here has to stop work while i run some checks on them looking at his watch my husband said alright how long the cop told him about an hour after the cop left the crew quickly finished unloading the cars and loading all the packages onto the trucks bound for the delivery warehouse and just as the cop in the flat bed returned the train was taking off into the wild blue yonder during the time the cop was gone my husband contacted corporate briefed them and they provided him with info to pass on to the officer once hed been told the package was on its way to the warehouse the cop flipped just as he began threatening my husband and his crew with all sorts of bullshit my husband handed him a piece of paper what the hell is this my husbanded responded that is the phone number to our corporate headquarters they and their attorneys want a call from you immediately we have security footage of you trespassing into company property and later i will be writing a statement in regards to how you tried to order me to break laws pertaining to the railway system your actions here could have caused a train collision due to demanding we stall our trains id make that call quickly because our attorneys are already calling the chief of police to ask why one of his on duty officers would be here demanding unlawful acts threatening people and trespassing the crew applauded and the cop had a mini seizure he screamed threatened and made violent gestures to which my husband silently pointed to a security can pointed their way thats on tape now too officer id get to making that call before im forced to have your truck towed for being on private property the cop internally admitted defeat and left the next day my husband got a call from the chief of police apologizing for his officers actions and kindly asked that my husband not push corporate to follow thru on a lawsuit and charges my husband obliged under the terms that no officer was to come onto the property again unless they were called or had a warrant he feared retaliation on himself and his crew the chief gave my husband his cell phone number and told him if any officer showed up without just cause to call him right away justice served

an yo girl came into my bookstore today and asked me where the megan mcdonald books were so she could get her judy moody on and we got to talking about school she said one of her classes is learning how to speak chinese impressed i asked if she could count to ten and she looked at me like dont be ridiculous everyone can count to ten in mandarin and then expertly rattled off the numbers i asked her how to say a few more words and she knew each one it was impressive to say the least her dad was off to the side lit up like a lamp and obviously incredibly proud of his awesome daughter so then this rando customer who was listening in piped up to say thats an important language to learn these days for business um okay then in a slow condescending talking to children voice koneechewwa yup she gets a blank stare from the girl and after a beat goes on to say oh thats advanced you probably havent learned it yet the girl exchanges looks with her dad and replies oh i guess not after the lady leaves the girl whispers to her dad i think that lady believes chinese and japanese are the same language this little hero was too goddamn polite to say anything to rando lady knows chinese and diplomacy shes got my vote i only wish i had the courage to have simply said konichiwa is japanese we were talking about her chinese class little hero could have kept her moment in the sun and i dont think id lose any sleep if it embarrassed the customer sorry little dudess
another story i saw on here reminded me of my own story i used to work at a red big box store one day a lady came through my line with argan oil at the time it was a really expensive product i rang it up with all of her other items and she stopped me to ask for a discount i looked at it and there was nothing wrong with the package at all she said she wanted a discount because there was a rubber band on the box i almost face palmed and politely told her that a rubber band on a perfectly good package was not a reason to get a discount she got angry and smashed the box herself she then very smugly said there now its damaged what is my discount i took the oil and removed it from the transaction i told her that it was too damaged to be purchased she looked at me like i had grown a second head and paid for the rest of her stuff as she was leaving the lady behind her asked if she could purchase the oil as it had been the last one of course i sold it to her at a discount sorry for any formatting or spellinggrammar errors english isnt my first language

i was working my usual shift at an office supply store when a guy came up to my register to check some things out so after ringing every item through his total came to about he proceeded to give me a coupon ok so your total comes to the customer looked at me as if what i had just said was the most absolutely ridiculous thing he had ever heard no its not it cant be is youre right and is still very confused he handed me and left sometimes i just dont know edit just to be clear he was a nice guy i just thought it was an amusing conversation we had in fact he was one of the nicer customers that day and i didnt mean to make him sound ignorant or idiotic seems like a few people thought it came across that way and it was by no means my intention
i was returning some clothes in the womens section when a lady came up to me slightly out of breath and flustered do you have these she asked pointing to the design displayed on a box of tights i checked the rails and found another box like that she shook her head evidently frustrated no do you have these she pointed at the tights again they had a lace design at the thighs meant to imitate garters ah garters she nodded i dont think we do garters im afraid i told her which is of course retailspeak for we definitely dont have that so you dont do them or you do do you think or do you know she was obviously pissed and in a hurry so i did the obvious thing and offered to ask a manager she swore quietly probably not at me as we walked before turning to me and saying he gives me an hour and tells me to dress like a whore what does he expect i kept my mouth shut and nodded sympathetically turns out we dont sell garters i informed her her best bet was a nearby lingerie store and she hurried away checking her watch 
the other day i had a customer who picked up three of a fairly cheap item p each or for which works out at a p discount i rung them up and said thatll be please lady thats not right theyre for arent they onesixty me no theyre three for two pounds lady it says right here three for two she points to the label by the item her finger is directly below the sign me that says three for two pounds lady oh well thats not as cheap as i want them me do you still want them or shall i cancel the transaction lady no thats not a helpful answer im thinking is it no to the first part or the second part then she walks out theres my answer and all that over a p difference a few hours later a man came in and picked up two of the same item i told him they were three for two pounds he brightened up commented that it was a good deal and picked up a third
so the other day about half an hour before opening i was facing up some of the shelves near the checkout area at the front of the store when a man came up to me asking when wed open our front doors bemused i managed to point out that we were closed before he walked off cheerily mentioning that hed head back the way he came through our back door that was definitely locked shut neither the colleague who was with me or i could work out how hed got in
im a cashier at a grocery chain that breeds special snowflake behavior in our customers weeks ago a couple came through my lane and spent roughly dollars worth of groceries apparently the man left with the building before the transaction was complete the woman swiped cards both of them declined twice a piece i got very nervous because i just had this job for barely a month and as i said her man left with the groceries i politely ask if she had another card she told me she didnt at that point i asked if her husband was coming back with the groceries she deflected the question i excused myself to get the manager because at this point my line was getting backed up and i just did not know what to do the manager voids her entire order and puts her aside to speak with her my next day of work i was scolded by my manager for not showing this woman compassion and not apologizing that her card didnt work little did my manager know that i have had dozens of customers who cards have declined during the transaction and in all of those times they paid up with cash after declined swipes at most and they were not with someone who left our store with unpaid for merchin those situations i did say im sorry but your card has been declined but in this situation i was too concerned about losing my job or not getting my next paycheck behind this with that said i was not rude to this woman nor visibly irritated with her i never found out if they ever paid or not and i do not even care at this point
this the second part of an extremely longinvolved story its recommended you dont skim read or skip seconds all of it is true the chinese wedding epic worst day part lets recap shall we i was late for work and missed and earlier run because i slept through my alarm boss yelled and screamed at me and nearly caused me to be late again was in fact late again for initial wedding pick up mins traffic was a nightmare to dropoff had an unscheduled pick up which im apparently held responsible for wedding coordinator sneakywc ties this freaking family heirloom bow across my limo the bow wire severs the power cable because of the windfriction risked my life dodging traffic to get a damn bow i get yelled at by a very pissed off father of the bride twice sneakywc had just threatened to sue my company and is possibly calling my boss right now and im out of on the pissed off scale pm to say my day is not going good is a hilarious understatement with the wedding taking place and ive got a couple of hours to kill the hood is popped and i start to do some surgery to the limo im no mechanic but i am handy and tech savvy the toolkit each vehicle has just the basics and i carry a piler with me i whittle away at both sides of the sheathed cable and expose both sides of the fine mesh of closer to the one on the right i then mash the two ends together and use a crap ton of electrical tape to make sure it holds for the next few hour i test it out and it works for now i make a phonecall to a fellow limo driver im friends with and rant to him about my day he is extremely sympathetic and ends up giving me a lot of advice on how to handle this father of the bride and sneakywc it turns out he was familiar with this run and was present when the boss was taking down the information sneakywc and fotb had tried to pull a fast one on me the extra pickup of the bride n company i just made was not allowed it would have cost fotb extra because of the time and gas required to get them not only that the boss specifically told sneakywc that she is not to tie this bow on the limo upon further review of the runsheet sure enough the crossed out chinese bow was in fact the bosses attempt at circling it and inadvertently crossed out the no directly above it i completely missed it before because i had only glanced at it previously opps with new found confidence i am calm yet determined to see this run through i now know that i can just take the bow off and argue with the fatherfamily because it was the wedding coordinator who pulled the fast one but its the bride and groom who are the real victims here ill let it stay on for the remainder of the trip because im just going to chinatown for the final dropoff out of on the pissed off scale i clean out the limo and make it picture perfect i microfiber polish the outside to a shine and even readjust the ribbons of the bow so that it will last the final leg of the journey i tighten down the front wires to the grill so that is this sucker is not coming off important later i notice that the fibers of the arms are stretched and very old the wind and excessive flapping has worn this thing raw getting run over a few times hasnt helped either ish the wedding has long been over but pictures at the church have taken extra time im to drop them off at pm at the restaurant with late afternoon traffic this is cutting it short as i dont want to charge them extra drivers clock out from a run by immediately filling the car up with gas at the nearest station once a run is over if the receipt timestamp is mins later than the run is supposed to end the boss will start asking questions or assume we pocketed the extra money bride and groom are smiling obviously in a better mood and the events from earlier that day have been tossed aside i settle them in and smoothly pull out of the parking lot im happy they are happy the birds are happy the sun is shining my limo is working and this hellish run is about to be over we are all good right ohh how wrong i was pm while on surface streets attempting to head to the freeway im noticing that the arms of the bow are looking worse for wear the excessive wind is literally pulling the fibers apart near the hood this catches the attention of the bride and groom and they slide up the bench seats to peer out the front window from the back bride is worried because the bow is a year old heirloom from her grandmother but accepts its pretty much destroyed the limo is cruising fast and the right arm of the ribbon tears free near the windshield and is flapping wildly in the wind umm that cant be good the three of us are practically holding our breath as we notice the left ribbon tears free close to the same spot moments later uhhh oooooooohhhh kaaaay thats not good im going to uhh slow down and take care of this ok with no protest from the newlyweds i carefully slow the limo down and make preparations to pull over you know how movies can sometimes slow down a scene and play it in ultra slow motion well i can still see the memories of what happened next replay in perfect high def slow motion when you have two silk pieces of cloth land on a waxy smooth surface like a hood there is very little surface friction combine that with an incline and gravity will take hold the two arms land gracefully on the white surface and start sliding forward to the front of the car lincoln towncars have a large fan in the front of the car large circulating fans in a hot car means you have a vacuum effect going on silk doesnt weight much the two long ribbons get sucked up under the limousine and whhirl wheeze clunk the limo just stops as we lurch forward dead nothing whaaaaat the what the hell i slam the hazard lights on again for the second time that day and step outside to inspect the damage the ribbons of this bow are strung tight like violin strings up and under the bumper of the car you have got to be kidding me come i go back to the drivers cabin and pop the hood only it doesnt pop wtf i go to look at it and the ing bow is still attached to the grill lincoln have the grill attached to the hood of the car rather than the frame of the vehicle when you lift the hood the grill comes with it i cant lift the hood because the bow is tied down with wires through the grill and the ribbons are locked up tight underneath the car im screwed out of on the pissed off scale i quickly explain to the bride and groom that everything is under control like hell it was and to please remain in the vehicle while i handle this with my suit and tie still on trusty limo repair kit on hand i crawl on the dirty asphalt to inspect the damage after a few minutes assessing the situation i determine that the only way im going to free the silk ribbons from the radiator fan is to literally cut the damn thing and attempt to unwind it i use the knife from utility and start cutting this year old family heirloom that has lasted through wwii ish im burned dirty sweaty and have road scum all over me i feel like a mike rowe should be interviewing me right now out of on the pissed off scale ive managed to get the ribbons unwound but they are shredded and an unrecognizable greasy mess from what they once were the bow is still locked in place on the grill but at least the fan is spinning freely when i turned it i ceremonially throw the heap of frayed ribbons into the trunk and grumble my way to the drivers seat i start the car it works and bride and groom are in a heated phone conversation in chinese probably the family they are wondering where they are i pull up to the restaurant to my final drop off but thats not the end of the story hell hath no fury like a father of the bride scorn end of part the chinese wedding epic worst day part edited a few things for clarification 
a friend of mine told me this story last night and i thought it was awesome enough to share my friend was working in a hardware store in college which meant she had to deal with contractors a lot and she said contractors were always pretty rude she had one in one day and she asked for his account number which is a series of numbers and letters he mumbled it to her and she couldnt understand him so she asked again he mumbled again she was getting slightly embarrassed and asked a third time because she couldnt understand what he was saying he finally tells her number in a loud voice he was visibly annoyed and goes you know i know a great place that sells hearing aids down the street she smiles pulls her hair away from her ears and responds with thats ok i already have two my friend is deaf the man went completely white and didnt say another word everyone she worked with was dying of laughter he never came back 
when i was a little kid and my parents bought me an ice cream i stood infront of the freezer as we watched the icecream person scoop the icecream and put it on the cone keeeeeeeeeep scooping go on keep going i thought to myself and then heshe would stop and hand you a minuscule scoop and leave you slightly disapointed you could have kept rolling the ball and you know it you think again fast forward years and im working in a cafe with an icecream freezer my boss put me on there yesterday and i took it upon myself to make as many kids days as possible you could see the look on there face as you kept scooping past the point where they thought youd stop and have a huge ear to ear grin on their face when you pass it over the counter to them it made my day a whole lot nicer when a dad walked over with his two kids who mustve been about and the kids were incredibly polite using all their ps and qs and being generally nice unlike some brats we get as they walked off icecream in hand i said to their dad those two were easily the two nicest polite kids ive served all summer he told me that meant alot and seemed genuinely happy with himself as he walked off to join the rest of family that was a good day
for awhile after college i worked as a security guard through a temp agency it was pretty easy work and you have to have a year of security experience before any of the big companies will consider employing you full time one time i was called out to be a guard at a street fair where one street was closed off and filled with two rows of vendors my job was simple stand near a baricade that blocked off the street and not let anyone drive through at first i thought this was rather silly since the street was barricaded with a a large black and yellow crossbeam and yet suv drives up and parks directly in front of the crossbeam the driver stares at it for about seconds the entire time im standing in front of it and staring back at him driver exits the vehicle literally walks around me and starts to move the crossbeam me sir the street is closed you cant go through here drivepointing to donut shop on other side of the street but i want to go get donuts me sir there is a parking lot to your left please park there and walk across or drive around the fair to the other side driver ill be real quick i promise me sir the street is filled with people you cant go through here drive theyll move ill go slow eventually i convinced the driver to park in the parking lot and walk the feet to the doughnut store i chalk that one up to just a severe caffeine addiction and laugh it off just as hes driving off another vehicle drives up this one starts honking the horn at me and pointing at the barrier i walk over to the driver side window me can i help you sir driver move the damn thing im going through me the street is closed to traffic you can go around driver long string of threats and vulgarities i casually walk over to the barricade and sit down on it watching the driver yell and honk his horn at me he eventually starts gunning his engine in a car where gunning the engine is not intimidating he eventually throws it into reverse and screeches off flipping me the bird on the way out the rest of the day is uneventful up until near the end when the fair is starting to close down as the fair is open until pm as best i can remember someone drives up to the barricade at and sits there staring at me me can i help you maam driver theyre not allowed to be here past six move the thing me maam the barricade will remain in place until the city removes it driver the fair is over at six so i am driving through here at six if i hit something its your fault me i understand maam let me get on the radio to sort this out i click on my radio and stand behind a large cement planter and speak in a presentation voice to ensure she hears me weve got a color make and model sedan at the streets intersection driver says that she plans to drive through the fair in five minutes even if people are still there requesting assistance license plate number driver is a description at this point the driver starts screaming at me from her window hes lying hes lying over and over about a dozen times with increasing scream in her voice as a police officer starts approaching the barricade from the fair side she actually tries to make a run for it she tries to make a sharp turn to turn around clips a light pole and a bench on the sidewalk and zooms towards the next intersection the police officer gets on his radio and calls it in and i hear sirens in the distance they didnt need my statement since the officer saw the person do the hit and run i didnt volunteer for fairs after that
so in college i worked a part time job at a hardware store i came back for a second degree so at the time i was a little older than the average associate there yo i had been working there for about a year and we get a lot of the same people in and out contractors plumbers etc and had even grew up in the smallish town so i know a lot of these regulars on occasion i would even go to peoples houses after hours to help them install things wire sockets and a bunch of little odds and ends that some people dont know how to do i promise this is relevant later so one day im out in the yard moving some mulch pallets with the forklift really hard to see around a pallet of mulch when its up on the forks and this guy driving a convertible blue corvette pulls into the side of the lot thats clearly reserved for storing the mulch he pulls up pretty fast narrowly avoiding me happens a lot i guess some people just done know how to drive around people operating machinery anyways he pulls into this parking spot right next to our propane fill up station smoking a cigar immediately i get off the lift and tell him he needs to put the cigar out he sort of laughs and gives me that ok whatever look and proceeds to set the lit cigar on the concrete pad that our gallon propane storage tank rests on i tell him he needs to put it out now or im going to put it out for him he tells me that if i touch his cigar ill have words with your manager and youll be fired and proceeds to casually stroll into the store one of the regular contractor guys that ive helped out a lot in the past and we know each other on a first name basis sees this whole thing happen and walks over toward me and says you should put that out on that leather seats we have a laugh about it as im stomping out the cigar still cant believe he left a lit cigar next to a propane fill station contractor guy tells me hell wait with me and explain it all to my manager when he inevitably comes out s sure enough about minutes later corvette guy comes out with my manager already in tow corvette guy is already pointing at me and yelling and my managerwho im on really good terms with and im sure will have my back regardless has the this will be good look on his face before corvette guy can really even get over to me the contractor walked very aggressively up to this guy with the smashed up cigar in his hand and throws it in his face yelling about how big of an idiot he is and if he doesnt leave right now hes going to crush his car with his dozer points to it on the back of his trailer and send him to the hospital in an ambulance i didnt know what to say and my manager looks from me to the contractor to corvette guy and without missing a beat goes uhh yeah sir dont ever come back here again next time you want to complain about someones behavior and try to have them fired for saving your life just remember that i know a guy with a bulldozer that will you up corvette guy sheepishly drove away never to be seen again 
i know that you all are painfully aware that customers are apparently incapable of reading signs but i just need to rant for a second the store at which i cashier has card readers that have the microchip option however the chip reader doesnt actually work so the customer has to slide their card instead the prompt screen on the card reader says please slide your card with an animation showing a card being slid on the side of the machine some people dont get that though and have still tried to shove their card in the chip reader after i explain that it doesnt work and they have to slide their card they get all huffy so i put a piece of packing tape over where they would put the microchip and also colored over that with black marker in hopes that people would get the hint that the chip reader doesnt work nope one guy actually tore the tape off exclaiming why the hell is there tape on here i suppressed my urge to scream and explained to him that the chip reader doesnt work he blamed me the cashier for it okay yesterday after customers in a row tried to use the chip reader i hung up a little sign reading chip reader does not work please slide your card thank you over where one would put their card in the event that the chip reader actually worked this morning a lady ripped the little sign off and tried to put her card in but i had replaced the ripped off tape so it didnt work she looked at me with a look of utter confusion and asked why her card wouldnt go in i just stared back picked up the sign she tore off stuck it back on the machine and pointed to it of course that made her angry because how dare i undermine her intelligence like that im out of options for getting people to stop trying to use the chip reader im going crazy
one of my ushers calls me over and says that there is someone wandering around looking for a manager i meet them at the concession stand its a woman about midlate s and her husband around the same age immediately she puts on her best ive been wronged face and launches into this story i was here yesterday watching the lazarus effect and your concession worker gave my husband coke instead of diet coke and he had a diabetic attack and we had to leave so he could get a shot i called and talked to someone on the phone who said that we could have free tickets and concession immediately i am suspicious of her story i had been there the previous day and did not remember her or her husband not only that but the usher she had asked for the manager was the person who was working concession the previous day they didnt appear to recognize him or else they would have mentioned that he was the one who served the incorrect drink do you have you ticket stubs or receipt i asked them which is the first thing i always ask someone who claims they had a problem the previous day no the person on the phone never told me i needed them they just said to talk to the manager she said indignantly ok who did you talk to i dont remember uhh well when did you call i dont remember so at this point i am severely doubting her story i tell her to hold on and walk into the small office off the concession stand to look at our attendance from the previous day i pull up the showtime attendance for lazarus effect and low and behold the show time she claims she was there for had tickets sold to it a huge grin spreads across my face as i print the report realizing i had caught her in a lie and was about to shove it right in her face i walk back over to her with the report in my hand so heres the thing i looked at the attendance for the previous day and there were no tickets sold to lazarus effect her face freezes here ill show you i slapped down the report on the counter and pulled a pen triumphantly from my hair heres the lazarus effect i pointed to the name on the report heres the showtime you claimed you went to i circled and heres the amount of tickets sold i circled the number wellthisthis is ridiculous your box office person sold us the wrong tickets then she said in a lastditch effort no if they sold you the wrong tickets you would have been in the wrong theatre you wouldnt have been in lazarus effect at all wellwell this is ridiculous your theatre i guess ill just buy my tickets she said and grabbed her husband who was silent the entire time and stalked off she ended up just leaving out of the front doors and didnt come back thats right bitch if you think im not going to fact check your story you are dead wrong

first time post so be gentle also i am not entirely sure that this belongs here but i thought this was the most interesting phone call at my last job setup i live in a small city i the midwest and i worked for a company that served adults with disabilities in a group home setting i am working at the main house the first house the owner opened and also the location of the office the number to the house also functioned as the main line to the business i would answer the phone when working since i would never have any idea if a manager or the owner was downstairs working and they did not like to get interrupted anyway so i am working one afternoon and this guy calls in and says something like you have someone working for you who is on drugs and i thought you would like to know this since the company is so small i have met every single employee so i bite me who are you talking about he names an employee that we dont have im a bit at a loss so i tell him thanks for calling but we dont actually have that person as an employee he insists that she is working there says her name repeatedly and very slowly as if that will help i again tell him this person is absolutely not an employee and add that i have personally met each employee and have never heard of this woman i remember there is another organization in town that works with individuals with disabilities the first two words of my companys name is the same as theirs and the third word is similar i suggest to him that he has confused our companies and he should call them him you dont care if your employees are on drugs me sir we would care if that was our employee but since that person doesnt work here it really doesnt concern us i am staring to get a bit frustrated him i want to speak with your supervisor now me they are very busy and dont have time for this this person is not our employee so i am not going to bother them with this him where is your office i will come down there and tell them myself since the office is actually a group home as well i really dont want this guy coming here besides the address to the company is listed along with the phone number so i lie me the location is confidential im sorry i cant tell you the guy really loses it starts screaming about how he knows that we have that druggie person employed and how he is going to come straight down to the office which he can now apparently find and tell to my supervisors everything and get both myself and this other person fired i tell him that i will see him soon then and hang up no one ever shows up fast forward a six years and this other company in town with the similar name has now hired me i am chatting with my supervisor about my new company and how they seem to be very accommodating and understanding she agrees and mentions that she dated a guy who turned out to be very unstable and he came into the office screaming about how she was on drugs and made up other lies to get her fired etc and the boss saw through that how they had to have his picture posted at reception and they called the police if he showed up then it dawns on me my supervisor is the employee on drugs from that call years ago

i work at a pharmacydrug store that prints photos this story doesnt have much to do with me but im so glad i was there to see it a woman came in with her two kidsa daughter who was around and a son who was about her son was dressed up in a police officer halloween costume i sold the mother her photos and then she and the kids walked around the rest of the store the store is actually right around the corner from the local police station in the most perfect beautiful coincidence ive ever been witness to the kid in the police officer costume ended up back in line with an actual real life police officer the kid was obviously excited but id say his reaction was mostly sheer admiration they took a picture together and the cop crouched down and did a thumbs up and the kid looked over and made a thumbs up too the cop was really great and talked with him for a while i know he was little but ive never seen a kid pay better attention to anything and i have a feeling hell never forget any of this finally he asked the kid if he wanted to see the inside of his police car of course he did the mom thanked the copwho definitely was enjoying himself tooon the way out he said this is the important part of my job the whole thing was so precious i almost cried 
short time lurker first time poster i used to work at theme park as a body artist to give a little more detail i worked as a face painter i paint faces and do temporary tattoos too this is one of my favorite stories to tell people try to get free stuff out of us all the time as most feel our services should be free in the first place sorry guys this isnt a discount carnival were an established company contracted by many big name theme parks all our workers go through weeks worth of training before they touch a kids face and we do our best to give you your monies worth its pricey sure but personally i feel its worth it anyways the story starts with a mother getting her daughter done up like a butterfly the painter is going above and beyond with the design since there was complaints that the picture was too simple to justify the price from the mother something like this only larger when it was done the painter threw up some extra glitter and stick on gems for extra measure and the kid was in love with it the mother however was getting really huffy about it gt mom it looks horrible nothing like the picture gt painter erm maam you asked me to make it different from the picture gt mom shut up its ugly and i wont pay for it come on honey were leaving she seriously tried to storm away from the stand without paying for the work done a huge no no my coworker gets in the way and in the most sympathetic voice says gt painter ohh im sorry miss i could never let you leave with such a horrible design i am so sorry here let me clean your daughter off for you gt mom wh no were just you can leave it gt painter i insist my coworker proceeded to wipe the whole thing off in a single swipe of a wet cloth kid was hysterical but years in this job makes you numb to a childs tears sorry kiddo really but it gives parents one less thing to try to guilt us with her expression was priceless and she couldnt get away from the stand quicker 
hey kids uncle gabriel cant sleep again so gather round for another story tonights tale is a story of desperation and rudeness that im sure weve all experienced in one form or another like both of my previous stories this takes place at the grocer i worked for years ago since this was summertime and i was out of school i usually got the closing shifts as a cashier this meant a lot of standing around and cleaning because small towns tend to go dead after sundown as a preface to this story i want to give you a little background about how we close the store when pm came we would turn off the sliding doors at the entrances and exits but we would only lock the entrance this was because the night shift had to get in somehow and the rest of us had to leave as well once all the tills had been closed for the night the program for the pos locked out until morning one muggy summer night we closed the store down promptly at and i cashed out my drawer since i was the only cashier this meant the system was now closed for good while counting out in the break room the manager and i are startled to hear a voice call out gthello we return to the floor to find out that a woman has pried open the stiff exit doors to force her way into the store there ensued a conversation something like this gt woman oh im glad youre here your doors arent working gt gabe thats because the entrance is locked maam we close at ten every night and its now gt w oh but i just need to grab some brownie mix my daughter is having a party tomorrow gt g im sorry to tell you maam that we cant help you we have no registers open and the system is closed for the night gt w but i just need brownie mix it will only take five minutes you can do that right at this point my manager intervened reiterating that we were closed and could not open another lane for her much to my amusement that quickly turned to annoyance this woman was adamant that she get her brownie mix in the end it came down to her ultimatum gt w im not leaving until you sell me brownie mix fortunately my manager was having none of it gt manager you can leave on your own or we can have you escorted out by the police ive seldom been more proud of my bosses over the years than i was then and fortunately for us both after a moment of slack jawed amazement the customer finally admitted defeat and left whew these stories always wind up longer than i think theyll be thanks for reading tfr ill share more stories with you all the next time i cant sleep edit words and typos
ive worked in retail for just over years but yesterday i finally had the customer from hell im a cashier in a pretty big sporting goods retail store i genuinely like my job my coworkers are great my managers and i get along really well its snowed and got pretty cold in the past weeks so everyone is panicking trying to buy bootscoatssnowpants cue scene lady comes in with a coat her sister bought for her kid zipper almost ripped out of coat the sister lives several hours away and has the receipt we tell her the coat can be straight exchanged for the exact same coat she can get store credit or she can have her sister mail her the reciept she agrees to an exchange send her off into the wild she returns to cash with a different coat oh joy i explain that the coat is a different price but if she wants she can pay the difference shes having none of it and insists that her sister paid the same price for the damaged coat side note that particular brand of coat doesnt even come near in any style after a short argument we send her off again and she returns with another coat still not the same one shes trying to return she says there is a difference and shes willing to pay that i explain to her that because she has no reciept the return price on the damaged coat is actually cheaper than the coat shes trying to buy she loses her mind and says you better get your manager back up here while im waiting on the manager she tells me shes going to get her sisters credit card number and we can look up the receipt that way uh no why not we legally cant look through your sisters credit card history thats ridiculous manager comes back up explains to her the exact same thing i just told her she demands to speak to the store manager he comes up and explains the exact same thing at this point ive stopped paying attention because im helping other customers but she finally relents and after a comment of fine ill just do a straight exchange thanks for wasting half an hour of my time we think shes gone but no sweet summer child minutes later she returns shoves her phone in my face and tells me that we have to give her the other coat now because she has a picture of the receipt i call the store manager back to cash and im out shifts done i escape to the back and hide there watching the security camera with another manager until shes gone i head to the front to leave and the first manager tells me the lady called customer service while standing at the cash desk and straight up lied and said we refused to return the coat at all manager then proceeded to try and tell cs that simply wasnt true and psycho lady screamed at her excuse me am i talking to you best part of the story the price her sister paid for the coat was price we offered to return it for zing tldr bitch of a customer tries screaming loud enough to get her way doesnt succeed and my managers stick up for me
first time poster so a bit of background i am a mature woman who has worked in an adult shop for nearly months i love my job i work in a part of my town that includes some very colourful characters and some lovely people but also due to my work i have to on occasion deal with some very strange requests and some very strangeweird people if you like my story i will post more as they happen on a very regular basis two days ago a very well dressed conservative looking gentleman of around entered the store he wandered around for a bit of a look before approaching my counter on the wall behind me is a leather display whips canes handcuffs and assorted bondage items he looks up and says nice display do you sell a lot of bondage items yes sir they are quite popular says i looks me up and down would you know where i could find a master to clarify here a master is a male dominatrix of sorts i suppose is the best answer someone who administers discipline to another and is paid to do so this may involve being tied up forced to perform various duties and may also involve whips and canes and other forms of discipline i have no idea where to find a master have you tried the internet sir then he floors me i am trying to find a master to discipline my daughter wtf my daughter has been unfaithful to her husband and we want to find a master to teach her a lesson then he starts with the long story while i am trying to pick my lower jaw up off the shop floor we have found one and he says that he would like to cane her of course her husband will be there for the disciplining session the master wants to give her lashes with the cane to start with now i need your opinion do you think this is too excessive to start with or do you think lashes is fair thankfully at this point another customer walked into the shop a lovely regular that always spends big so i replied to mr masterseeker with i honestly dont know too much about the bondage lifestyle sir so i dont think i can comment on that and now i must go and help this gentleman have a nice day 
im the customer in this story but i think all you tfr guys out there who work behind a deli counter will appreciate this i was at the supermarket today and the deli counter had a huge line there were three women working as fast as they humanly could and honestly doing a great job of moving things along i was almost done getting my cajun turkey when the woman being helped behind me lets call her hamhocks asked her counter person to let her see the thickness of the ham she had just sliced for her the girl took the top slice off a pile that was at least a pound and im telling you i could see through it hamhocks isnt satisfied gtno thats not thin thats too thick they wont eat ham that thick youll have to do it again im sorry no she isnt but i see thick slices there so the girl puts the ham aside and starts slicing again again hamhocks waits until the entire pound is sliced before asking to see the ham its so thin its basically falling apart the pieces arent full size because theres no way a slice that thin stays together hamhocks grabs the top two pieces and says loudly angrily and with a pinchedup face gtwhat is this is this how you slice ham how the hell am i supposed to make a sandwich out of this this is terrible you dont know what youre doing one of the other slicers comes up and says let me do it again for you ill do it just how you like it and hamhocks shouts gtno youll get it wrong im going somewhere else where they know how to slice ham all the slicers and the rest of the customers stand there with their mouths open and watch her stomp off amazed at the display of petulance they just got to witness i tell the first slicer that first batch was transparent shes clearly nuts and a very gallant dude behind me said she just wasted two perfectly good pounds of ham give them to me ill buy it tldr apparently if ham is too thick it becomes poison if its too thin it loses structural integrity and you cant make a sandwich with anything less than x perfect rectangles of ham ham ham ham ham ham 
so today at work i doing my cashier thing and a gentleman comes up to buy a drink and presents me with a bill that has been taped back together this particular gentleman is shirtless twitchy and pupils so small the are practically nonexistant now normally a ripped bill would not be a problemif he had the whole thinghe does not there are clearly pieces missing the pieces were even from the same billas far as i could tellthey were not i would have even considered taking it if he had of the bill plus a serial numberagainnope by presents me with the bill i mean he walks up sets down his drink and tosses the bill on the counter and looks up at me expectantly i look at himlook down at the bill look back up at himand he demands well me dudeseriouslytheres no way i can accept this customer why the fck not me its in piecesalsoyou dont even have the whole thingdo you have another form of payment customer common man but im really tired me i cant accept parts of bills customer but i worked all day amd im tiredcan you tape it together more me there are pieces missingdo you have another form of payment customer fine fck you then at this point he hurles the mangled bill at me and storms out and here is the bill in question in all its glory tldr meth is a hell of a drug edit i did some more research and a non mutilated bill can be exchanged at a local bank a mutilated bill must be sent to the bureau of printing and engraving a mutilated bill is defined that is not cleary more than percent of the original bill and must be sent in with a lettee stating estimated value and how it got mutilated although the picture doesnt show it tbe top left is a different color than the rest it appears looks more to me like there are fragments of two bills maybe not tho at any rate it may be technically legal tender for all debts public and private but not for spending in a retail store edit technically legally could i have accepted it maybe management would not have let that fly however and i would likely have gotten written up also after some more googleing it probably wasnt meth based on a few peoples suggestions
i work at a fairly well known pizza chain in australia and like all retailhospitality workplaces we get our share of whack jobs but this one from a few months back probably takes the cake i was running the morning shift when a customer walked in the other girl working with me who we will call jane went to serve this man who shall be called angry man am she was down there for a few minutes before i started hearing raised voices i rushed down to see what the commotion was me is everything alright here am no this woman is trying to poison me me excuse me am i am lactose intolerant me okay at this point jane walks away flustered am i asked for a pizza without cheese and she said she would remove the cheese how dare she try and poison me like that me im sorry sir im not sure i understand the problem am talking like im five ill start from the beginning shall i i want to order ten pizzas i run a large company i basically own half this town i am lactose intolerant so i need a pizza without cheese that woman said she will remove the cheese making a pizza with cheese and then removing the cheese and giving it to me is poisoning me me im sorry sir but i think theres been a misunderstanding what she meant is that we will remove cheese from your topping list as in we wont put cheese on to start with im certain no one is trying to poison you am well thats not what she said me im sorry for the miscommunication would you still like to place your order today am yes but ill expect some kind of compensation for having to deal with that evil woman me what exactly would you like by this point another customer walks in we will call him reasonable man rm am well i think all ten pizzas for free should suffice me im sorry sir i cant do that i could throw in a couple of free garlic breads but i certainly cant do ten free pizzas over a misunderstood sentence am do you realise who i am me im sorry sir i dont am i own this town if i walk out this door you wont have any business by next week me im happy to help you today sir but unfortunately i cant give you ten free pizzas because of this am youll do ten free pizzas or youll lose your damn job rm excuse me but i think you need to calm down am this is assault im being assaulted ill call the police me sir you can call the police but no one has touched you let alone assaulted you angry man starts walking out yelling the entire time am ive been poisoned and assaulted just you wait this place will go under i swear it i was left standing there basically gaping after him while reasonable man had a chuckle this has been one of those customer horror stories that i tell every now and then and makes me wonder just how people can be so ridiculous in case you were wondering we made record sales this summer despite that lunatics threats 
just a little background in the uk or at least this store the personal alcohol license is given to a couple of individuals rather than the business as a whole in this case to my two managers this means theyre responsible of making sure we stick to the law when it comes to checking id and refusing sale to anybody who cant produce it or who is under the age of this also means that if there is a group of young people you have to assume that it could be consumed by all of them and check all of the ids to make a sale or if you get the impression somebody is purchasing not for themselves but for somebody who looks young you need to check that persons id if you get caught selling alcohol to or to be consumed by somebody underage it is you personally who will get in trouble you can loose your job and never be able to get a job in retail again and you can be fined up to through court or an on the spot fine of you personally not the store this means you have a personal incentive to be extra careful with alcohol sales over this summer i was working in a mini supermarkettype shop on a coastal town which attracted a lot of tourism within the uk without sounding snobby the place attracted a lot of people who could be considered a bit rough all day drinking chain smoking swearing unruly kids you know the sort this one particular day i was working on the till and the shop was relatively empty when a woman and her child who looked to be about wondered into the shop they went over to the alcohol section which is just a few meters away from where i was standing and proceeded to have a loud conversation about what they were going to buy i will call the woman w and the child c i will be n gt w im getting some wine and some beer for your brothers what do you want gt c motioning at a bottle of cheap vodka can you get me this for tonight gt w put it in the basket anything else gt c yeah and some of these too i love them picking up a pack of alcopops they were seemingly oblivious to me but being literally a couple of meters away and the store being quiet i had heard the entire conversation when they came to pay i exchanged some pleasantries gt n hey did you find everything okay gt w dismissing me yeah yeah gt n okay great turns to c im going to have to ask to see your id please gt w assuming it was directed at her and sounding irritated im im clearly over gt n oh ur i meant your daughter can i see your daughters id please gt w but im the one buying it gt n i know youre paying for it but a lot of the items are for your daughter i need to see her id or im afraid i cant sell any of this to you gt c theyre not for me gt n i was standing right here i literally heard your entire conversation gt w cant you just let it go this once its her birthday gt n no i really cant now the woman looked really angry and just turned cussing loudly and walked out leaving me to put away her basket of shopping i thought that was the last of it but she came in a couple of hours later by herself picked up the same items and attempted to buy them again when i told her i still couldnt sell them to her she started ranting loudly about how terrible the shop was and how she was going to complain and get me fired sorry but im not going to risk my job and a fine to sell alcohol to your obviously underage child
i dont know if this story belongs here or not but it is a funny story and i hope you might enjoy many years ago i was working in a call center on a variety of projects a particular project asked us to get as conversational as possible with their clients in order to better tailor our sales pitchup sell pitch one particular call i was talking with an elderly woman ew from here on out and i could hear some children in the background apparently playing i asked the client are those your children i hear in the background ew no they are my grandchildren do you have children lcnite lcnite no but my wife and i are considering it ew oh really well do you want a boy or a girl lcnite to be honest just i just want a healthy child but being a man i would love to have a son at this time my client decided to launch into a minute detailed explanation on how to guarantee a son she told me preparation steps to take before sex the positions to finish in and even things that my wife should do to ensure our success in creating a boy okay so that was cringe worthy but i got the sale and i was pretty happy with it until my supervisor pulled me to her desk super umm lcnite i listened to that last call and i just wanted to let you know that you could have ended that call at any point the moment she brought up your wife and beyond lcnite well thats okay i got the sale and you and i are both adults and married and only you and i know what kind of discussion that was so hey its all good after a call that long though i do need a smoke so i am going to take a break super go ahead enjoy come back to my desk fifteen minutes later my supervisor calls me to her desk again super umm lcnite got a little bit of news lcnite okay sure thing whats up super well it turns out that i was not the only one on that call quality control also happened to be listening lcnite oh jeez well nothing i can do now but hide my head and carry on super there is actually a bit more see this is still a test bed program and so from time to time the director might observer a call she was on this one too lcnite crap that is embarrassing her husband works with my wife this should make for interesting conversation okay well anyone have any negative feedback super nope everyone thought you did great and you should be commended lcnite awesome so can i put this into practice and take the rest of the day off hehe super no sorry there is one more piece see from time to time the client will also dial in and since this is the pilot the client is the board of directors so good on you you impressed the client greatly lcnite slinks off in shame nine months later upon the birth of my first child my wife and i received a lovely gift basket at the hospital the card was signed as follows congratulations on the newest edition to the lcnite family we hope the instructions worked out for you congratulations on the boy signed the board of directors edit thank you to who ever gave me gold very kind indeed
so i work at a pretty big grocery store in downtown toronto and i was on my lunch break today and i walked past one of the aisles and there was a little girl probably about or years old sitting on the ground all by herself crying so i went up to her and said hey are you alright and she didnt answer me so i said do you know where your mom and dad are and she gave me a muffled no so i said do you want me to sit with you for a while until they come back and she was like uh huh so i sat down on the ground next to her and i had a couple of paid stickers in my pocket that we put on items that are too big for a bag and i said can i give you this super special sticker its actually magic because when you put it on your parents will know exactly where to find you and i put it on her hand and she stopped crying and just stared at the sticker for a while and then i asked her who her favorite princess was and we started talking about beauty and the beast and then a few minutes later her mom comes running down the aisle screaming kelsey and the mom turns to me and shakes my hand and starts thanking me almost in tears and it made me feel so good to know that i made that little girl feel a little bit better because i think we all know how scary it was to be lost in a big store like that when you are so young tldr im gonna be a really fuckin good dad when i grow up
so a few years go i used to work for a convenience shop in the uk its one of the very large ones it was about pm we shut at pm when a few customers came in one of them was a woman who looked a little strange the usual crazy eyes odd clothing strange smell when she had finished shopping and got to my till she quietly asked under her breath gtcan you help me take my shopping to my car i think theres somebody following me around the shop now we have no obligation to help customers with their shopping once weve taken their money but i occasionally helped nice old people but this woman seemed very agitated and scared id not seen anyone following her and i thought she was delusional but i thought that if it calmed her down by helping her with her shopping i might as well do it the next minutes passed without incident and i cashed up my till after cashing up i remembered what the woman had said so i decided to check the cctv from when she was in the shop lo and behold there was a man following her around the shop he stayed at quite a distance from her pretending to look at items on the shelf and putting items in a basket but always keeping her within his eye line whenever she went around a corner hed move quickly around a parallel corner to continue to keep an eye on her from a distance the real kicker was that when i helped her with her shopping he placed his semifull basket on the floor followed us out of the shop and got in a car in the car park and continued to follow her a scary thought is that id not even noticed him he was following her that well we called the police
preface my first job was in a knife store in los angeles when i was the owner was an old veteran from chicago i basically had run of the place provided i didnt do anything inordinately stupid or if i did i cleaned up afterwards the scary little girl i was doing inventory and stock checks one weekend morning when a friend of mine came in he shared my passion for all things blunt or bladed and i knew him well enough to trust him to walk around behind the counter and investigate items at his leisure a customer came in an almost irritatingly cute asian girl probably just shy of five feet i started over to her with a traditional howarya one word no reply necessary or even expected greeting when my friend makes a beeline for her this can pretty much only be entertaining and i figure i can throw something at him if the situation gets out of control or he says something too stupid gtfriend hey how can i help you gtgirl um i dont know im looking for something for protection a friend of mine got mugged recently my friend proceeds to tell her about the various stun gun and pepper spray options i keep an eye on them an extra minute to make sure he doesnt zap one of them or something then go back to checking inventory i can hear him chatting her up a little but im not really paying attention when he comes over to me gtuh kyen can you help me out here this kinda didnt go the way i thought it would i turn around and the girl has a volt stun baton pepper spray and a hand ax with an articulated individual knuckle guard think smallish ax with brass knuckles for the handle gtme hey friend tells me you have some questions gtgirl no i think im getting these keep in mind this girl is tiny the ax is longer than her forearm and the stun baton isnt the usual subtle little device most people like for protection its about ten inches with electricity arcing around it gtme did i hear you say you wanted this for protection this is all a bit much for any day to day carry also bladed weapons arent good for self defense unless you really know how to use them any weapon you dont know how to use belongs to your enemy gtgirl i just want to look scary do you think people will be afraid to come near me gtme well yeah you effectively scared off friend and i couldnt do that throwing knives at him that ax isnt street legal though gtgirl its going next to my bed i shrugged gave her a quick once over on the laws and maintenance around the baton and pepper spray and rang her out friend came over to me after she left gtme decided not to ask her out shes cute you can probably still catch her gtfriend next to her bed shes putting the ax next to her bed no im not going to fing ask her out edit i was at this job for over years so i have a lot of stories ill probably put one up every few days or so until i get bored or everyone gets sick of em that said other tales from the knife store pointing robot why would you say crystal safe it never balistic behind the warning control just a flesh fortune and a dart the bad but i want it the good samaritan princess and her a stupid question the ornery preacher 
this happened about a month ago but seeing the recent posts about kids made me want to share a happier story im sorry the story is long and im having trouble condensing it blame the neighbors who are having a loud party my head is filled with bass a mom and a little girl maybe at the oldest come in and are browsing its a slow day and theyre the only customers in the store the little girl is following very closely behind her mom saying things like mommy look this is so pretty and general oohing and aahing the mom is fantastic looking at everything her daughter points out but also reminding her to be careful the phrase that stuck out to me most was gt remember dont touch things can break so to look you only have to use your eyes you dont need to use your hands the little girl is listening and doing what shes told but getting her face super close to the displays so she could see better it was the cutest thing ive ever seen her mom gently tells her she doesnt have to stand so close and at this point im beyond shocked with how loving but firm but also attentive she is with this little girl it seemed too good to be true and it was i hear a mischievous little giggle then a crash i rush over to make sure that no one is hurt before i say anything the mom is on her knees looking the little girl in the eyes asking her what happened i hung a few steps back since i didnt want to interrupt the parenting and could see the girl wasnt hurt so i started cleaning up the broken ceramic the little girl looks at me like shes so scared im going to be mad and says gtim sorry please dont be mad i touched it and i shouldnt have but it fell and broke my hands didnt listen my brain told me not to but my hands and she keeps going on nervously i stop her and tell her that its okay accidents happen even i break things accidentally sometimes the mom offers to pay for the damaged item we dont have a you break it you buy it policy accidents happen we mark the item out dispose of it safely and move on i tell her this and she goes about shopping making the girl hold her hand and keeping an eye on her just being an all around awesome parent as they were checking out the little girl looks at me and i crouch down so i can talk to her she says very matter of factly gtthanks for being so nice us kids were people too we have bad days and sometimes our hands do stuff our mommy says not to i couldnt stop laughing and all i got out was gtyes kids are people too i saw you had your hands held tightly so they were good the rest of the time you were in here thank you for being so brave and telling me about it and for listening so well she smiled and said gtyes i am good and i am brave tldr kid breaks thing mom is amazing parent kid and mom go on happy kid tells me kids are people with mischievous hands 
i was returning a bike wrong size and a couple other little things at the local edited to protect the something last weekend i walked up the the service desk and there was no line so we started the returns from different purchases the first went through no problem but the second return for the bike they had to call someone up to make sure they could accept the return large ticket item i guess the whole time this is going on a small line forms nothing too crazy but it happens the person working the desk was very nice and helpful so we are waiting on the manager to come approve the return when this crabby old bitch cob from the line hollers girl you best get on the damn phone and get someone else to help us the girl behind the counter looks at me and says see what i deal with every day and ignores the lady i remember all of you fine folks and decided that im going to speak up because i know the employee cant just not sure what to do yet a few minutes goes by and the manager comes up and he asks why im returning the bike and i tell him and crack a joke we both start to laugh and i hear cob say white boy thinks he funny slowing down the line i instantly make eye contact with her and she looks away so the manager approves the return and we get everything sorted out i tell the lady behind the counter thank you and i turn to leave but i stop and i raise my hands and in a nice projecting voice say folks i know i held up the line and i want to apologize to all of you for the delay except for you i point my arm out and stare right at cob the rest of the line looks at her too i said you need to be more patient and learn some manners i turned around and walked away 
a few years back i used to work at a medium sized supermarket in the uk and this post just reminded me of this i had a middle aged woman come up to me and simply shout mayonnaise in my face it took me a second to realise that this was a questionrequest and that she wanted to be taken to the mayonnaise after we arrived at the mayo section she angrily asks me wheres the ketchup naturally i was confused me well you asked for mayonnaise angry lady but i want ketchup me why did you ask for mayonnaise angry lady because it should be with the ketchup i then took her to the ketchup which incidentally was the other side of the damned store 
i work at a store that sells everything as an associate and sometimes cashier surprisingly this isnt about a work experience i had but an experience as a customer nsfw okay for christmas my friends with benefits at the time bought me a vibrator the batteries ran out so i decided even though i hate buying these things to go to the store and purchase some batteries and some lube for fun time later i find the items no problem and then go through a check out line i think i just buy these two things and candy bar the cashier looks at my items then looks at me he says we both know why your buying these items i feel my face getting warm and just laugh nervously well it would have been more awkward if i hadnt said anything he said to me id have to disagree
i worked in a very large supermarket near cincinnati this store had everything a cincinnatian could ever need your cincinnati sports merchandise cincinnatistyle chili in cans cincinnati cincinnati cincinnati etc enter a lady and her friends they walk right past all of the cincinnatirelated merchandise and go straight for the electronics they request the most expensive stuff that we sell and lots of it multiple laptops multiple tablets cell phones etc its all in lockup so the customers must tell the cashiers they want all of those things well when one of them requested worth of seeminglyredundant electronics it caught the managers attentions because nobody ever buys that much perhaps she was buying gifts for all of her friends in cincinnati who knows the transaction was monitored closely by pretty much everyone in charge the cashier per procedure requests id from the lady the lady presents it without hesitation its scratched up and looks a little flimsy for a government id but hey lots of ids look weird like that right so the cashier finally reads the info on the id which is as follows someperson whatsherface someplace rd cinncinati oh to the shock of everyone her payment was declined she tried to raise a biiiiig stink about it to get it through she threatened to sue us threatened to call corporate made all sorts of threats still we were forced to inform her that the machine wouldnt take her payment because the city of cinncinati doesnt exist finally the lady gives up she takes her id payment and leaves emptyhanded with her friends but thats not the end of this story this lady might not be able to spell the town that she lives in but shes a smaaaaarrrt criminal with lots of tricks up her sleeve thats why the very next day she walked in to the same store requested the same merchandise and tried to present the same misspelled id for verification she was arrested on the spot 
typical day at work yesterday in a big retailer big guy says scuse me retail smile hi what can i do for you he points behind me see that guy over there i turn around sure enough there is a large man in a trucker cap standing on the other side of the counter the counter creates a kind of booth customers can approach from any angle the first man speaks again that man wants to see your beanbag a moment of panic flashes through my mind why would this guy want to see my beanbag its not a particularly impressive beanbag also why is this guy asking for this other guy is he some kind of hired goon a mercenary that gets dudes to show off their beanbags all i manage to say is uh the first man speaks you guys normally have beanbags on display all over the place we cant find any finally i realize that hes not talking about my beanbag in particular but beanbag chairs relief sweeps over me oh those havent been in since christmas management orders a bunch of them a couple of times a year then well go months in between without them you can still get them online though the two men leave somewhat disappointed and my beanbag relaxes after having retracted itself into my abdomen
i work at a large arts and crafts store where cranky women love to roam when they have nothing better to do im also and do homeschooling so i work a lot for the store this is my first story but ive got a ton more that i can share so the night before last i was working and my register got super backed up i was gonna call for back up and i had a few times before but i couldnt because we were understaffed for the night and all the people working were busy so im trying to get everyone in line out as quickly as possible and its pretty obvious so this one lady like a couple customers back goes hey you know a lot of people are waiting is there someone you could call or something since you cant seem to ring people up quickly enough mind you she was rude as hell while saying this and i go yes maam for sure just give me one second and ill do that even though id tried previously so i finish checking out the customer thats ringing up while like five other people wait and i call for back up on the registers again so right after that i turn back to the lady who initially asked and i go sorry about that maam were just understaffed tonight and im doing my best said all that realllllly politely too and then she has the arrogance to say oh yeah i was just asking i dont need the attitude reminder that i was being polite as hell so the best part about this story is the fact that the customer id previously been ringing up turned to the lady and was like um no maam he was being really polite there was no attitude in what he said you should calm down the woman looked super embarrassed and to top it off the next lady i checked out whispered to me dont worry about her you were very polite and shes just a bitch it took everything i had not to laugh by now one of my coworkers had come up and was checking people out the woman who said i had attitude ended up going to my coworkers register and by the time shed gotten checked out i had checked out like two or three people that were behind her originally karmas a bitch i hope you enjoyed waiting an extra ten minutes to get checked out by going into the other line when you were so obviously in a rush
i used to work at a little village green type shopping centre on the very edge of the cbd medium sized supermarket bakery newsagent sandwich shop and a cafe were the only shops there i worked at the bakery right next to the main exit of the supermarket all the walls were glass so i could see the whole front of the supermarket being on the edge of the cbd and the clubbing district there were a lot of less savoury characters read alcoholics or drug addicts who would go into the supermarket and shoplift i usually saw them leaving the supermarket with their ill gotten goods and would try to point them out to staff but most times wouldnt be able to since theyd go in with the lunch rush when the supermarket and bakery were flat out when i was able to notify the staff they usually couldnt get out in time to stop them there was one time that the girl working front end managed to get a guy who stole medicine though this is that story so its a quiet day at the village green im bored and making faces at my friend who works at the supermarket when i notice a dodgy looking character leaving the supermarket this guy is maybe foot and really dirty stained clothes ratty hair and beard skinny as a rake a stereotypical drug attict looking guy if he was a disney character hed be an evil rat sidekick to the main bad guy after he thinks hes out of sight of the supermarket he stops and pulls some boxes of medication out of his hoodie paracetamol or something im not sure i make eye contact with my friend and nod my head towards the shop lifter i expected him to go out and handle this since hes a foot broad shouldered metalhead but no the little foot nothing petite blonde chick who looks like a sneeze would knock her over sees my nod towards the shop lifter and takes this upon herself she gets out from behind the front end counter faster than anyone ive seen walks out the store comes up behind the man and taps him on the shoulder when he turns around she simply grabs the boxes and says thank you dont come back please with a huge grin on her face then goes back into the store the shoplifter was left standing there too dumbfounded to say or do anything and just wandered off while my friend and i just laughed our asses off edit cbd central business district this is where most offices are within a city sorry i didnt explain that i assumed it was a commonly used term everywhere not just australia edit why are so many people getting titchy at me for using the term cbd since the name of my city refers to a vary large area including quite a few suburbs the term cbd is what most people here use when referring to just the actual city part im sorry this is confusing for so many people edit the quick aussie translation guide cbd see above newsagent a person or a shop selling newspapers and magazines also sells stationary has some legal forms does photocopying sells drinks etc flat out just means really really busy eg sorry we cant meet you for coffee with the kids sick and getting the house ready to sell were flat out
i work in a big city that is very culturally diverse i also happen to work at an electronics store that sells computers i also happen to be a woman who has piercings while this is not a big deal in my store were encouraged to be individuals it helps us connect with customers it is occasionally a huge issue with my customers i had a very conservative older man in the other day who was looking for help finding a desktop weve been slammed lately because everyone is getting tax returns back and i had a few customers stacked i went up to him and said something along the lines of hi im so sorry but all my associates are busy right now as soon as one of us frees up we can be over to help you guys out itll only be about five minutes at this point he looks right at me and says if i wanted some stupid girl who is dumb enough to mutilate her body with gross rings note only one of my piercings is visible at work i would have found asked for you okay ouch right whatever im used to it so i went to my home theater department and grabbed one of my guy friends ill call him a who works in that department and told him i needed help with a customer he then asks old dude if he needs help and old dude happily tells him about why he needs a new computer a said something along the lines of well actually know nothing about computers but spanishsweetie over there can help you to which i replied oh no i cant im too stupid and girly for this you got it a of course old dude asked to speak to a supervisor who happens to be female he then demanded to talk to my manager who is also a female after hearing the whole story my manager kicks him out because he was being a dickbutt and harassing female staff tldr dont mess with the dumb women in a store we might have more power than all the men 
background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of july and new years eve this story has absolutely nothing to do with that story my daughter and i spent the day in an orlando theme park yesterday not run by a mouse not the best idea since it was a holiday weekend but she loves harry potter and i love here so daddy will brave the crowds when she really wants to go while we were browsing in one of the stores i saw some crazy lady going off on a poor cashier i made my way near them so i could hear what was going on partly because i felt like i should say something to the shitty customer but mostly because im nosy as hell the customer was ranting about the price of something and was basically accusing the cashier of trying to rip her off for charging so much i honestly didnt catch what item she was upset about but apparently whatever it was justified screaming at the poor female cashier behind the counter the female cashier had to be in her teens and she honestly looked like she was about to break down and cry at any time i reeeeeally wanted to step in and say something to the loudmouth but i was worried about getting into an argument with some stranger in front of my daughter enter the store manager the guy comes rushing over and plants himself between the screaming lady and the cashier he did it so smoothly i was jealous he walked behind the counter and with a quick movement used his arm to gently move the cashier back while placing himself in the line of fire while he was moving the cashier back and stepping inbetween them he was looking at the screaming lady by stepping in he broke the customers eye contact with the cashier and took it over for himself smooth brother smooth then even more impressively he told the ranting customer that if she was unhappy with the price she should leave for those of you unfamiliar with theme parks in orlando this is definitely not the way its usually handled too often the screaming guests get away with just about anything watching the outcome definitely made me feel good and i was glad to see a manger stand up and put an unreasonable customer in their place ten minutes later i was spending for an authentic ravenclaw robe maybe the lady was right if youre interested ive posted a few other stories 
he went fishing by himself and never came home they found him the next day cqlled it coldshock drowning he was a genuine person brightened up a room just by being in it he was always happy and made the best of every situation even working in a crappy fast food restaurant never brought him down he would whistle while he worked constantly through rushes and slow periods during the dirtiest hardest cleaning jobs he never stopped whistling unless it was to smile i dont know how to move on from here theres a hole in my store for hours a week he was a joy to work with and outside of work he was one of the few employees that i could call friend im going to miss him so much i dont know why i posted this here i guess i just needed to get it out ive never had anyone close to me die i dont know how to cope anyway thanks for listening edit thank you all so much for your kind words the funeral was today so i missed my chance to say these things to his family in person but ive decided to write a letter to tell them how much he meant to us at the store and to me personally i really cant thank you all enough for your kindness and advice i know ill be back here reading all of this when i feel like i cant take it anymore you are all wonderful 
so i work at a chain of supermarkets in australia the store i work at is the flagship store for my state and its very big shiny and posh we get a lot of snotty customers from the area of course that means that a whole bunch of customers are quite rude so today i was working in the bakery mostly alone as my coworkers were doing things around the store we sell cakes for these cakes are kinda a ripoff but they are pretty good and get good reviews anyway a middleaged woman comes up to the cakecase and i ask her what she wants she proceeds to explain that the deli across the road has the same cakes on for i still dont know if this is true as then they would have been making a loss on the cakes and they were likely on sale and going out of date ill call the customer cl for cake lady cl so can i have the pink one for me uh no im sorry we dont change the prices of cakes cl but i can get other ones of the same brand for across the road me im sorry its not possible cl what about pricematch me price match is only for grocery items im sorry cl its for my daughters birthday party me sigh would you like me to get the manager cl yes i get the manager of the bakery she explains the same thing so the woman leaves all huffy muttering about pricematch about minutes later we get a call over the pa for the bakery manager to the front to settle an issue the bakery is right across from the registers and i can see that its the same lady hassling the checkout guy about pricematch i watch the manager go over explain the same thing i explained before and eventually the store manager has to explicitly tell cl that it cant happen before she gets it the checkout guy comes over later and says so basically that womans daughter isnt worth an extra bucks i wouldnt be surprised if shes back tomorrow for another try edit i just got told that she took her complaint all the way to head office i hope they still told her no no one told me we have to change anything so i can assume that they brought it up as an example of what price match doesnt cover 
at i was finally able to get a job and start making me some monies applied at a few local places and ended up taking a job at fat krispy chicken fkc for the few weeks there were no issues i was a computer nerd already so learning the register and procedures was a cinch i only worked hours per week still being in highschool my manager was a yearold bitch at this point shed been thin and pretty but notsobright when she started working there and had gained quite a bit of weight due to her free manager meals of complete grease she hated that i packed a lunch from home instead of eating the slop we served topping it off id caught on to things way quicker than she had and people talked about it and it caused her to hate me in my third week im up front manning the register when a couple walks in a very large couple lb each the man wheezes up to the counter and makes their togo order of a piece family meal with a family sized side of potato wedgies and two family sized mashed potatoes im thinking this is a big order but their big people and i dont know how many people theyre going to be feeding anyway i ring the order in and tell him his total and his wife suddenly looks pissed and yells im eating too wut she orders hot wings and two family sized orders of potato wedgies seriously she then follows that up with and i need a large diet coke at which the man chimes in that he needs a large diet coke as well im laughing internally at this point but it is a togo order and they probably have a few kids or another family coming over something right it has to be their order comes up and they take the gargantuan bags of food to the dinein tables me im sorry folks i thought youd ordered that for takeout i could get you some trays if youd like man dont need trays we always order takeout because im not paying tax to eat here cheap fucks they just spent nearly on food but cant pay the tax eh whatever i go about my day and start cleaning the lobby im mopping and trying to ignore them so they can eat in peace when they stand up i figured something must be wrong so i look to see and the foods all gone in roughly minutes nearly calories of extra krispy wings and potatoes stunned silence im staring at the trays covered in bones and destruction that these customers kindly left for us to clean instead of throwing their trash out woman notices me staring and and gets pissed calls for manager manager comes up and listens to how badly i treated them by acting like she wouldnt be eating too and then making fun of them for eating a healthy wut meal she told me in front of the customers that i had two choices apologize to the customers for my rudeness and take a write up or termination fat lady customer was smiling and pleased with herself i laughed and told her if working there was going to turn me into a fat angry slob like her and our wonderful customers then leaving this job would be a blessing took my apron off and put it on the counter clocked out and headed for the door the whole time the fatties are bitching at me and manager both come back here are you going to let him and manager is trying to calm them down and yell at me come back here you cant do and its all just background noise because it suddenly feels like all weight and stress has been removed from my shoulders still one of my best retailfood memories

seeing their faces was easily the best part of the day they tried to use coupons and place separate orders to beat the one coupon per customer rule completely oblivious to the fact there were people behind them in line last time they were here they sent back the tacos they didnt pay for because we didnt cook brand new chicken fajita just for them it takes minutes to cook and this is fast food then they let their kids use the dining room as a playground other customers were getting pissed off at them too the general manager didnt want to refuse service but you can either say yes to these fuckers and keep people happy or say no and keep people happy edit everyone is asking for a story and i wish i had one but they just walked out

i used to work for a clown or the scottish place if you prefer it was wonderful to be honest it was owned and operated by a local guy who also owned another franchise that his wife ran awesome people it was my first job i got paid a dollar over minimum wage meals were free we could take home leftovers at the end of the day yay apple pies my managers were all great people most of my coworkers were as well i left on good terms at the end of my senior year of high school i came back about years later my life wasnt working out as planned so i moved back in with my parents walked in one day to get something to eat and before i knew what was happening i was giving them my uniform size and starting the next day i was cool with it needed a job that one was like riding a bicycle quickly got back into the swing of things then corporate came calling they had seen the amazing profits this store in a rural area was making million a year in profit in a town that has more cows than people and of course they wanted in on that the owners were getting older late s early s had built the stores about years earlier and wanted to spend more time with their grandkids they sold both stores to corporate made a nice chunk of change to retire on they left on their yacht to sail down to the bahamas for a year or so then came corporate and becky she had been an agm at another store and was anxious to prove herself as a brand new general manager she didnt like that employees all got free meals but the previous owners had made that a stipulation in the contract she insisted that our paper costs were out of control and made a rule that drivethru customers only got one napkin per meal ordered customers complained and i directed them to becky she also discontinued the store policy of free refills in the drivethru we only had about regulars who took us up on the offer and they understood but didnt like it we had a group of elderly gentlemen that would come in every morning they all got a senior coffee and would sit and bullshit with each other for a few hours bette who worked the counter in the morning would have their coffees waiting for them with the appropriate cream and sweeteners by the time they got in and plunked down their cents becky made her stop how do you know what theyre going to order she asked theyve come in every weekday for the past years and ordered the same thing thats how i know bette replied she was a sweet lady but didnt take shit from anyone becky replied that she didnt care and if food was made before it was ordered again there would be writeups in bettes future and things like that continued no more taking home leftover apple pies thats stealing the only drinks employees were allowed to have while working were soft drinks or tap water previous owners allowed us whatever we wanted from coffee to shakes if we wanted something else we had to wait until our meal break or pay for it customers noticed the changes and started not coming in as often sales and profits fell people started quitting even employees who had been there for years i left after a few months quickly finding another job becky only lasted a year and a half before corporate took a look at the numbers and decided that she wasnt doing well profits were cut at least in half sales were seriously down from previous years corporate sold it back to an owneroperator and from what i heard for considerably less than they paid for it in essence becky refused to listen to the employees and managers some who had been there since the store opened as far as how the store needed to be run and insisted on doing it all the corporate way from what i hear its still not the same as in the old days but it is considerably better than the corporate days

hello tfr reading all your lovely stories brings back so many memories of why i got out of retail people whove never worked it just cant comprehend some of the things we see every day but i guess its like that most places since youve all been giving me flashbacks ill share one of my favorite personal stories from my time in the trenches its black friday has it been years already wow im working as a tech for a large us electronics retailer but everyone works sales on black friday right and its right before the gates open i and a few other employees that are not in the departments that will be attacked in the first wave have this tradition of lining up against the entrance rails the chrome things that funnel people in of the store on bf its kind of like watching the running of the bulls in spain for us it helps you get amped up for whats going to be a long day so the pep talks have happened everyone is in place and the store manager unlocks the inner door and chains everyone sort of holds their breath as the outer doors are unlocked and slid open the store manager barely has time to hurdle the entrance rails before this mass of people push past us in a frenzy of greed and entitlement towards the front of the pack is a woman probably mid s dragging her elderly mother easily or so along on her quest for cheap consumer goods then like a stereotypical action movie everything suddenly slows down sounds become muffled and indistinct we all see the old woman stumble we see the terror in her eyes as she trips falls to one knee and lurches forward we see her daughter look back over her shoulder at her mother now in very real danger of being trampled the daughter lets go no hesitation in her step no look of regret in her eyes her head snaps forward intent on her prizes as she merges back into the crowd the mother drops to the ground surrounded by chaos and it reminds me of watching platoon at this point we snap back to realtime and myself two rather large security guys and the manager jump the rail and try to push the mob back through the door so we can get to the old woman i end up helping get her off the floor and out of the way while the security guys play riot police and trade insults and in one case black eyes with the mob we get the woman back to the store office shes shaken and scared and a bit bloody due to a split lip and her nose impacting the floor store manager puts a call in to ems and we try to keep her calm until they arrive she starts asking for her daughter afraid she might need to go to the hospital so we start paging overhead and i go out to try and locate her in person im out looking for minutes or so with no luck with pages still sounding overhead as i work my way back to the office the emts have arrived and have the woman on a gurney checking her out bumps and bruises but they think shes fine she needs to go be checked over anyways she doesnt want to go without her daughter so they agree to wait a bit longer an hour after the fall the daughter rolls up to customer service ignoring the huge register lines with an overflowing cart of product she demands that we check her out immediately so she can tend her injured mother and take her to the emergency room she starts ranting immediately about how horrible we all are for caring about money more than her mothers health customer service chick isnt having it im not having it manager is trying really hard not to let loose on this lady and the emts are just disgusted before any of us can really do anything the tiny little elderly woman wrapped up in bandages strapped to a gurney looks her daughter square in the eyes and says fexpletivek you daugthersname before turning to the emts with lets roll boys daughter freaks out at this and while her mother is being wheeled towards the entrance she grabs hold of a police officer that was standing nearby he came in with the emts tearfully demanding he do something about the situation officer friendly takes one look at her and says lady ive heard the whole thing you can expletive wait in line like everyone else if you cause any more problems for these people youll be leaving with me
i own my business we have an awesome pos where i can and do store customers names addresses and phone numbers its a fabric and yarn store where it is helpful to know what a customer bought previously especially when theyre asking me we recently had a customer come in and tell us shed paid for a partially assembled shop sample hanging on the wall and was here to pick it up i have employees and hadnt heard of anyone buying it but have a habit of believing my customers particularly when i know their names so i pull the sample off the wall and fold it up she stands around and chats for a minute all the while im searching the computer to see if weve got record of the transaction im not finding anything and she must see a bit of confusion on my face because she grabs the sample and quickly says her goodbyes turns out she didnt actually pay for the sample so we call her she claims that one of my employees told her it was and shed given the employee while she was just too busy to get it off the wall we dont price things at the level we dont take cash without a register transaction and we dont sell a dollar sample for less than we tell her she needs to come into the shop and pay off the difference were not fighting about the at this point this has been a week ago she still hasnt come back our options now are call the police and report the theft or tell all of her friends who shop at our store and call her church mennonitegerman baptist cap wearing types and ask them to pass along the message that she owes us money this one is going to be fun a quick edit on the slanderlibel thing there is video proof she walked out without paying and our pos has absolutely no record of any payment or purchase by her since april 
back then couple years ago before i changed departments and went to gas station i was a cashier at a local grocery chain i had the misfortune of working christmas eve luckily i worked in the morning and was out by noon im working the till and that christmas eve morning it was actually raining and cold no snow it doesnt snow where i live i was near the exit so would constantly get a breeze of cold wet air i had been working the past days so i could get the following week off and be able to hang out new years eve things were going smooth when i had my first difficult customer of the day snobby lady we will call her me hello find everything alright snobby lady yes yes i did its nice and cold outside but im not liking the rain me yes it is and me either hopefully it doesnt rain tomorrow on christmas day snobby lady i know im going to come early to get some more things for lunch and dinner for my family tomorrow now just a note we are closed christmas day we always have been we have signs on every single cash register stating we are closed and will open the next day me oh well you should get those items right now or later today we are going to be closed tomorrow its christmas day snobby lady oh no ill just come tomorrow me maam we are closed tomorrow snobby lady what do you mean your closed tomorrow its christmas day i have things i need to buy me and i have a family id like to be at home with and spend my day with if you have things you need to buy do so now snobby lady i need to speak to your manager now at this point i was like great i shouldnt have said that my manager shows up to speak to her manager yes maam how can i help you snobby lady your employee unrealdude while looking at my name tag said you are closed tomorrow i demand this store be open i have things to buy and i am the customer manager im sorry maam but we have signs posted all over the store stating we are closed and the signs have been up for over weeks now i suggest you buy what you need now she was quite taken back at this response snobby lady i know insert main store managers name here and i will make sure you and unrealdude will get fired for turning away a customer manager if you would like to speak to him he is actually right there point in direction snobby lady i will enjoy being jobless on christmas she left and went immediately to speak to him he paid little to no attention to her and asked her to leave his store if she was going to continue to harass him and his employees that main manager has probably never stood up for his employees he usually does what the customers want even though its against corporate policy

so i was stocking dog biscuits at the pet retailer where i worked for three years an elderly woman and her daughter approached and i greeted them and asked if i could help with anything they declined so i went back to stocking the dog biscuits out of no where the elderly woman reached across me to grab a bag of treats from a higherup shelf as she brought the treats down from the shelf she brought her elbow straight into my face now she didnt hit me hard enough to do any real damage but an elbow to the face will cause anyone to react right i mean i kind of teared up and the womans daughter kind of spazzed out mom she said you should apologize the old womans response but why she works here
another annoyance from the gift shop as mentioned in my other posts we also sell lotto tickets this was some time last year and there is a huge jackpot on that night so naturally im flat out there is a constant line about people long and im going as fast as i can while remaining pleasant now some people come in with their card that has their favourite numbers saved on it and many of these will have multiple tickets one for each day or whatever while their tickets print i usually make some small talk about the weather or ask whats on for the weekend etc as im going through customers i notice a lady huffing and puffing rolling her eyes im sure you know the kind shes all dressed up short dress open toed shoes and it is cold out i live in a fairly rural town and usually only see people dressed like this in the middle of the night for clubbing or when the horse races are on so im a bit confused as to why the hell she insists of freezing herself anyway im serving a regular lady and have a bit of a chat while her tickets print and i have her sorted in about minute so now im up to miss huffnpuff hp hp you realize that if you didnt talk so much the line would go faster im freezing and you are making me stand in line me wondering why the hell she isnt wearing a jacket and scarf like everyone else i just like to be friendly while things are printing so we arent just standing in silence is all what would you like so as her tickets print i ask how she is and she just gives me this glare and ignores me so i try not to roll my eyes as she goes to leave i glance at the screen again before clearing it for the next person and realize ive short changed her me just a second sorry i shortchanged you by a dollar i smile and hold out the coin for her hp snatches the coin and scrapes me a bit with her nails heaves a big sigh all the service in this town is horrible all you rurals have no idea how to treat people in big city mistakes like this just dont happen whatever i just ignore her completely i have the freedom from my employers where i dont have to take shit and go to the next in line remaining my cheery self while hp starts crapping on about how great the city is in comparison and i internally start hoping she chokes on the smog im just thinking about telling her to please leave when one of my regulars i guess him to be mumbles loudly oh my god faarrkk ooff everyone hears him and i try not to snort laughter which is hard since the guy im currently serving is shaking with silent giggles hp you people are absolutely appalling no respect whatsoever young regular guy then says what you want us all to kiss your rings coz youre from big city or something she clip clops angrily out of the shop and into the rain while everyone cracks up laughing tldr lady thinks we should kneel before her mighty high heels
background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square foot of fireworks heaven story i think this week im going to focus on stories about people who try to scam me they rarely get away with it but that sure doesnt stop them from trying we had two customers that came into the store and announced to the cashier that they were looking to spend around and wanted to pick up a lot of fireworks my dad greeted them and offered to show them around dad went through the spiel and started showing them videos and helping them out the entire time these two were trying to work a better deal i know most people dont try to haggle when shopping at their local target store but hey i get it its a fireworks tent and the truth is we usually are willing to haggle a bit especially if youre picking up a lot of stuff these guys definitely took it to the next level my dad is one of the nicest people youll ever meet but this type of thing wears on him pretty fast especially when someone is obviously going over the top its one thing to offer a lower amount for an item but when you start criticizing the products or my store my dad is going to quickly lose interest in helping you after about minutes of this i could see dad was pretty much over these guys so i walked up and told them that if they were going to pick up a lot of stuff we would just give them off their total order they immediately protested that that wasnt good enough but i was pretty firm i already know that im cheaper than anyone else and is a substantial discount hell the only reason i did is because my dad was tired of dealing with them and i wanted to get them out of the store the guys finish picking out their stuff and go to check out they fill out the liability waiver and the cashier starts to ring in their stuff after the cashier rings in their purchase she waves me down and i walked over to the counter to see what the issue was tweedle dum and tweedle dumber td were trying to pay with two gift certificates now i give away a lot of gift certificates on the radio and during sales promotions the thing is i only give away gift certificates these two idiots have obviously photocopied and altered a real gift certificate and are trying to pass it off now im pissed me this is the worst forgery ive ever seen you guys are idiots td i won those on the radio theyre real me my gift certificates are printed on custom paper and i only issue gift certificates these are colored scans of a gift certificate and theyre not real td yes they are td besides if youre gift certificates dont say no reproductions on them you can make copies me yeah thats not what the law says what the law does say is that youre guilty of rd degree felony theft for trying to steal of fireworks their amount before the discount td we didnt try to steal anything me you attempted to pay with a forged document its the same as if you used a stolen credit card i have your name address and multiple witnesses and i fully intent to press charges you guys can stay until the cops arrive or they can arrest you at home doesnt matter to me td thats not real we didnt steal anything me oh because the last two times this has happened at my store never actually happened before the people were arrested and convicted of theft i guess well let the police sort it out if you cant pay for the fireworks its theft td and td start an intense negotiation between themselves that involves more than a little shouting at each other after a while they insist that im wrong but theyre willing to pay with a credit card just to be done with it theyre trying to figure out how to split up the when i informed them that the total was theres no way in hell i was giving them a discount after they tried to scam me in the end they only paid for and received around of fireworks and they had to split the charges over four credit cards between them to do that we were very careful with the signatures and i made the cashier copy down their drivers license numbers just in case they tried to dispute the charges to be honest i would have just let them leave if they had tried its not really worth my time or effort to press it and i was actually just making it up as i went along because they pissed me off they definitely didnt leave happy my dad couldnt resist when they were walking out dad you dumbasses come back and see us again next year they havent been back if youre interested ive posted a few other stories 
tldr cart not cat so at my store popular west coast electronics store we have carts filled with open box discounted merchandise last night i helped a customer with an item and put it in his shopping cart a few minutes later i see him come back to my area and browse through the open box cart i turned my attention elsewhere for a few minutes and when i turned back to the open box cart it was gone and the cart with his one it me item was still there i look around and see him browsing the aisles with the open box cart signs and all after a couple of minutes he looks down at his cart and looks really confused he then walks back put the open box cart back and grabs his cart funniest thing ive seen in a long time
on mobile so excuse my formatting this just happened earlier today i work for a cell phone company a lady came in wanting to add new lines of service to her account she picked out our most expensive higher end cell phones immediately red flags went off in my head firstly the account was based in another state secondly she really didnt seem concerned with monthly cost she had an id that matched the account holders name but i was feeling really suspicious i let my manager know my concern so he joined me at the table and started asking her questions like what brings her into town etc etc she suddenly says she needs to run some errands and can she come back we say sure after she leaves i called the number on the account and got a hold of the account holder who confirmed she wasnt in my store and is in fact in another state at that point we confirmed it was fraud and contacted the police the fraudster actually called back and asked if her phones were done yet i told her minutes and she could pick them up she ended up not coming back not sure if she saw the cop car even though we told him to park in the back and got spooked either way it was a satisfying feeling to stop someone from committing fraud and hopefully getting her busted in the future

first time post apologies if im too longwinded back in high school i worked for a coffee chain lets call it barschmucks we had all sorts of customers and a few good regulars but one of our regular demographics was the elderly we were located very close to a pair of assisted living homes and were in a community thats white and whose average home value was so we had quite a few grandmas and grandpas coming in one trend i noticed was that the oldtimers would often want their drinks hot they would almost never order cold drinks and they would request that their lattes be extra hot wed often be asked to microwave drip coffees because degrees ostensibly wasnt hot enough for them so one day a little old lady comes up and asks for a zen tea extra hot no problem my coworker rings her up while i make the tea on our coffee maker theres a hot water spout you know those red levers that dispense water well in case you didnt know that water is at an offboil degrees its hot enough that you cant hold the bare cup whilst filling it lest you burn your hand to make tea you simply grab a cup drop in the tea bag fill it with the water top it and serve it i do steps but while trying to put on the top the wall of the cup caves inward and sends degree water all over my arms and hands this isnt the first burn ive had working there so i dutifully remade the drink immediately i hand the lady her new cup of tea and apologize for the holdup she takes a sip frowns and asks if we can make it any hotter i look at her down at the blisters forming on my hands then back at her forced smile no maam thats as hot as it gets tldr found a severed human finger in the mocha mix served it to hundreds of customers anyway
maybe its the six day streak of eight hour shifts but either my tolerance for rudeness has gone down or something in the air has made customers ruder any who it does remind me of this incident a few months ago so were a smaller version of big uk supermarket chain but one nevertheless i get people haggling prices all the time even one women who argued because it was cheaper than she initially thought if you wanna haggle go to a market its quiet and im sweeping up near till when the infernal noise of self scans go off telling me to verify the weight of items on the scale no biggie happens a lot customers put their own bags on them or even so much as look at it funny and it freaks out i go over to the guy with a look on his face i can only describe as i dont have time for this and see whats up he doesnt want the apples he scanned sighing over how produce is expensive okay i go to cancel them as i do so and go to put them back he grabs my wrist mistake one i may be a retail lapdog but you dont touch me especially to grab then he comes out with this gem why dont you just put them in my bag confused i scan them back in wait i dont want to pay for them but i want them now its dawning on me but i hang tight to denial sorry sir i say but i cant just give things away thats theft ill get fired he sighs loudly again almost sarcastically but produce is expensive no one will know come on just give them to me now im pissed my job is not worth losing because you dont want to pay for apples i repeat one last time for emphasis sir i cannot do that if you dont want to pay the prices im sure there is a green grocer that has cheaper apples but im not letting you walk out with something you havent paid for i cancel it grab the apples and keep a close eye until he pays and leaves on the way out having the balls to say hell complain good you do that id really like to hear how its an atrocity i wouldnt let you leave with things you havent paid for sheesh 
i work with children a lot as a photographer as a portrait studio and one of my favorite sessions is year old cake destruction shots this mom bring in her little girl and tell me that shes looking for some normal photos and then shes going to change her into a tutu and wings and tiara for her cake destruction photos pretty standard thing for me really so the session is going pretty normally for the first minutes then i tell her we can change her for the cake shots mom gets her all dressed up while i pull down the easy to clean white backdrop the little girl looks ridiculously adorable and mom can not stop laughing at how its just hit her that she just became one of those moms who dress their kids up like this just holding her daughter and cracking up looking at her i love this lady we set her daughter down on the backdrop floor and put the cake in front of her she just stares at it and i get a couple cute photos like that and i tell mom to show her its ok by putting her hand into the frosting and cake and then her daughters hand into it mom does it and the little girl laughs then mom puts her hand in and she looks shocked for a second eats a little bit and then burts out crying just wailing i take a few shots any way because this may be as good as it gets but thats when it gets good bad her daughter then tries to get up and get away from it but the poor things doesnt know where to crawl away she hasnt started walking yet on her own and pushes her hands really far into the cake for stability which normally is adorable but shes screamcrying now im still shooting away because im a crazy person apparently but moms not helping her either she eventually realizes she cant crawl away because now its surrounding her when this determined look takes over her face her daughter pushes all the way down on the cake reaching the floor and stands up mom is clapping and saying good job and it grabs her daughters attention and her daughters hatred of being dirty from the cake has her reaching out making grabbing motions at mom whos sitting next to me mom makes the motions back thinking shes just supporting her standing on her own and then it happens her daughter started walking towards her for the first time ever on her own the pure hatred of having dirty hands and feet from cake has spurred this little girl to walk for the first time and you can bet your butt that i started shooting like a mad man moving around in different angles as fast as i could to get as many shots as possible of her first walk she eventually makes it to mom whos nearly in tears from pride and laughter of the situation and collapses onto mom covering her in frosting as well at that point my time is up and mom and i are just laughing so hard we can barely breathe mom cleans her daughter up in the bathroom and i clean up the cake and frosting from the backdrop i edit the photos and make a few collages of her first time walking and a number of birthday card examples of her bawling her eyes out looking like godzilla smashing cake city i sit mom down to slideshow the photos and she has doubled over at the ridiculous photos of her daughters first walk her daughter in a fairy costume and tiara covered in cake bawling her eyes out walking for the first time she bought the whole set the best part she came back at the christmas season and brought me a present a little cupcake with a candy camera in the frosting she told me that all of her family is in love with the photos and that her husband was so happy that he didnt have to miss out of photos of his daughters first steps and that the ridiculousness of the photos made it better
so i was a customer in this shop it is a small sub shop owned by really cool guy who is a really good cook there was this really mean customer who was complaining that after she finished her sub it was horrible and wanted a complete refund also my apolologies on formatting im using a phone at this point she calls the owner an asshole tells him that his food sucks and continues to demand her money back without even blinking the owner looks at her opens the register takes out a and then says you have bought and eaten your sandwich making satisfied noises while you were eating the sandwich and if youre going to be like this i dont want you as a customer to show how little i care this is the you gave me a few minutes ago he then tears the bill into little pieces smiling and then said get the fuck out this guy will continue to have my business
mobile apologies for poor format and story telling i work for a large health and beauty pharmacy chain also includes a photo department which we call the lab this story takes place a couple years ago when i was first being photo trained we have ll lab lady who was training me she was leaving for a break and i assured her i could run it fine on my own she then points to a lady in the corner on one of the kiosks and tells me she may need my help minutes after ll leaves i hear oh misssmashing i need your help okay obviously ll told her my name ill refer to this lady as sw strange woman sw please help me im not sure how to choose a photo as i go to demonstrate selecting a photo i notice that all the photos displayed are of her boobs sw whoops giggles how embarrassing at this point i realise her stance is one that she thrusting her assets more forward than normal weird on screen some of the photos are upside down sw oh no will they print upside down me uh you can then physically turn the picture round i demonstrated she chooses the ones she wants bearing in mind all the pictures are almost identical same angle same lighting no creativity then asks me to show her how to scroll through so i show her how as i go down through the photos they also go down no joke she had the flash on on her lady parts i could see her insides all on the screen i dont know how i kept my composure this woman was slightly strange and i think she enjoyed watching me cope with the situation they werent exactly flattering pictures but whatever later ll comes back smirking at me she knew this woman as a regular and knew exactly what she was going to put me through and it was hilarious edit i think i should clarify some things i still work in the lab the lady has never returned it was unpleasant but she wasnt doing anything illegal just strange i did check with ll for clarification on the rules this woman had some sort of mental disability i cant say for sure but when i am in charge of the lab it is my discretion how to handle these situations i made a decision to help her quickly so she could leave quicker all it is now is an interesting story its awful that it may have had a different result if she was male but i cant speculate on that either interesting comments though thanks
i used to work at a cake place that sold personal size cakes in little containers one day when a lady orders one and i hand it to her she examines it and complains that its way too small she demands i go to the back and get another one i take the cake go behind the doors to the back wait seconds and come back out with the same cake is this one better she looks at it very closely for a few seconds yes much better thank you so much
you have to buy an entire extra unit before you get a free one glad we all understand that its a shame that customers dont so my store runs bgf i can understand how the wording can be a bit ambiguous if you cant think for yourself sorry this sale brings out the worst in me so this lady c comes up to my counter holding two spools of thread gt me just the threads was it mate gt c yes please gt me its bgf at the moment so you can get a free thread if you like gt c yes the till has just freed up so i turn to log myself in and ring her items up when i turn back to her gt me did you grab a free one gt c yes gt me waits a second for her to hand it to me she just stands there okay ill just have to grab it so i can scan it for you gt c youve already scanned it gt me no mate ive just scanned these two gt c you dont understand your own fucking sale do you reaches over the counter and snatches the threads out of my hand its buy two holds up both threads and get one free holds up one of the two threads gt me picking up some packets of needles that are on the counter no mate its buy two holds up two packets of needles and get one free holds up third packet of needles what youve got there would be buy get free which is not the sale were running gt c shouting well why dont you buy two and shove them up your arse she then threw the threads at me and stormed out wtf another quick one also bgf its the only sale during which a customer will tell you how many units they want to pay for instead of how many they want why just why a semiregular customer who is a total bitch tb comes up to the counter with some fabric gt me how many metres would you like mate gt tb two im the first to admit that i can be very petty about this sale especially after three weeks of explaining the damn thing to people i cut two metres from the roll and put it to the side while i grab her next roll gt tb how many metres was that gt me two gt tb what about my free metre gt me you said you wanted two metres ive given you two gt tb i only want to pay for two metres i want three altogether gt me ah but that wasnt what i asked i asked how many metres youd like not how many youd like to pay for gt tb grumbles alright fine can i get three metres of that one gt me absolutely retail smile tldr if you cant understand buy amount get amount free shop somewhere else edit ive noticed a lot of comments about my attitude and i wanted to clarify this sale has been on for three weeks and i wrote this directly after coming home which is why i sound so cranky p with the first customer we were both being perfectly pleasant with each other up until the point where she swore at me then at that point all bets were off i dont care what the sale is you dont talk to me like that with the second customer granted i could have handled the situation better but for context when this woman has come in in the past and this isnt just with me but other coworkers as well shes asked for of something ive given her pay for get free right and then she claimed she wanted to pay for six and get another free but then other times shes come in shes said shes wanted and did actually want but my coworker based on previous experience serving her believed she wanted to pay for and so gave her a total of and the customer threw a fit about it with the vast majority of customers im perfectly polite about explaining the sale because i agree that the wording could be ambiguous but this woman damn well knows how it works and just tries to make things as difficult as possible
so i work at a small momandpop stationary store yesterday i had two ethnicity stereotypically known for haggling over everything customers douche douche come in with packages of latex balloons they wanted inflated in all this is a rare occurrence of the time the customers buy and inflate the balloons instore they go up to the only other employee a girl k thats somewhat new and still a little shaky on the more advanced parts of the job im over on the lotto station and the two stations are on opposite ends of a somewhat long counter the ear im deaf in is facing that end so i have pretty much no idea whats going on until i hear k marxr do we inflate balloons me yeah the price sheet is on the wall by the tank its a pretty uncomplicated sheet but there are different prices for just the balloon just the helium or whether its mylar latex or one of those jumbo balloons yadda yadda k apparently read the number for buying just a latex balloon as opposed to inflating a balloon and quoted that number douches oh you can do better than that blank stare k has no fucking idea what to do so she calls me over i still have no idea whats going on i send her to the lotto station to take care of the line thats forming as four of our regular heavy players all decided to come in at once me okay so whats going on here douche we wanted to inflate these balloons they say carefully looks over the packages helium balloons helium balloons helium balloons theyre all helium balloons can you inflate them me yes douche with helium me yeah thats all they really use to inflate balloons its per balloon douche she said apiece me did she looks at the sheet to doublecheck oh i think she must have accidentally read the price for just the balloon its to inflate douche but she said now if they had initially agreed to when k said it they wouldve paid gotten inflated and left probably without me ever noticing even if i did notice i wouldve honored the price they paid and done the job i wouldve just spoken to k afterwards but they declined the offer and now its off the table me im sorry she misquoted its to inflate douche oh you can do better than that given that they didnt know what kind of gas goes into a balloon minutes ago i assumed that statement wasnt based on any kind of knowledge about the helium market so time for some education me i really cant actually theres a helium shortage true and the gas costs us far more than the balloons themselves true theres also labor because this is going to take us upwards of half an hour to do true if youre going to do i guess i can pricebreak the same deal we do for a dozen balloons but thats it d what does that come out to me and change ill even round it down to if theres one thing im good at its mental math d are you sure thats right me yes d can you check on a calculator i give the baby his bottle and punch the numbers into a calculator with douche craning his neck over the counter to look at the screen lo and behold it comes to me yeah and like i said ill go down to but thats the absolute lowest i can go d what does that come to per balloon me apiece d are you sure me puts calculator away yes d chain does it for apiece im wellversed in our competitors prices and last i heard it was but who knows maybe they decided they didnt like making money anymore me if thats what theyre offering than i suggest you go there we cant go any lower than for everything d theyre all the way in neighboring town we dont have time to go there this is for a party in an hour oh good one of these people improper planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part me im sorry but thats our final price d get the manager me i am the manager somewhat true we dont really have titles but im definitely ranked above most of the other employees in terms of authority d then the owner get him me shes next door at clothing store shell be back in a bit d can you call him me yeah ill call her i call her she doesnt answer i leave a message i find out later that she left her phone in her office me sorry theres no answer i can promise you she wont go any lower than though d dollars for balloons is a lot of money me well its a lot of balloons d takes out puts it on the counter you know ill pay in cash you said the owner wont be back for a while no i didnt you dont have to ring it up he doesnt have to know even if i felt like ripping off my boss i dont shes great theres no fucking way i couldve gotten away with that k wouldve seen the whole thing the owner has a fucking voicemail talking about the balloons the helium tank wouldve been noticeably emptied and the owner would almost definitely have returned before i was done this isnt to mention that hes operating with the subtlety of a wayans brothers movie and two of our good regulars are standing right next to him and heard the entire thing by this time k is drowning in a sea of complicated lotto orders and this one dickbag regular with no patience for anyone that cant read her mind i dont have time to explain how miserable he is at bribery i need to get these cheap fuckers out of the store so i can help her me look its for all the balloons or per thats the best i can do now if youll excuse me i have paying customers to attend to i walk away and start taking the line of people they talk to each other in some foreign language for a bit and leave the store we get the line down laugh about how stupid they were and out of curiosity i call the store with the purported fillups turns out its apiece and they dont do any price breaks for fillups about minutes later the douches return with two more people in tow douches amp they start asking all sorts of ridiculous questions about all the different costs for all the different balloonrelated services if theres anywhere else nearby that can do them cheaper like im going to tell them until we get back to d so how much is it to fill up a balloon me d but same chain as before does it for d no its me actually i just called them and they said if youre doing i can pricematch that so itll be for everything d but you said me and you said chain charges d puts one bag of balloons on the counter okay we dont have any time so youll inflate this bag for me no i can only pricebreak if youre doing it in bulk balloons will be d but we dont have time for all anymore me im sorry but thats not my fault i can pricebreak at or its per balloon they jabber in their language again and storm out balloonless if they were telling the truth about their time crunch they either got no balloons or went to the chain store paying more in gas to get there than they saved and were very late my boss didnt even care about losing the sale once i told her the full story i have instructions to ban them from the premises should they come in again tldr grown adults spend half an hour haggling over a few bucks they end up gradually raising the price and failing miserably at bribing me

i used to work in a vegetarian cafe it was a lovely place the owner had given up a stressful career in law to open it and the cafe though reasonably new had become pretty successful we mostly did coffee and cake including glutenfree cake for coeliacs one of the first places in my small town to do so several years ago before the glutenfree craze became popularist rather than a dietry requirement but we also had a few main meal options like pasta bake with or without cheese two varieties of soup every day quiche and so on everything was veggie and some things were vegan too the whole menu was written on a blackboard right inside the door facing the door so you could not miss it we also had menus on the tables and the soups for the day named on further blackboards in the cafe occasionally we had customers like this i shall call the customer fred because i prefer stories with names rather than initials of attributes and i am ally fred had come in with two young children about years old gt ally good afternoon sir are you ready to order gt fred looking at his menu do you have sausage rolls gt ally no were a vegetarian cafe we dont serve meat gt fred oh can i have two childsize ham sandwiches then please and one chicken sandwich gt ally sir we dont have ham or chicken were a vegetarian cafe we can do cheese sandiwches or weve got quiche pasta bake and our soups today are spicy sweet potato or leek and potato gt fred sighs okay two cheese sandiwches brown bread and ill have a quiche lorraine quiche lorraine contains bacon gt ally we dont have quiche lorraine were a vegetarian cafe todays quiche is spinach and tomato gt fred sighs again okay ill just have that then so i write down his order add the drinks he asks for and leave the table before he asks for a meaty side
i work at a pet store an older woman came in and looked at dog beds and wanted to take some out to her car to decide which one she wanted she was actually offended that i told her that product cannot leave the store without being purchased first taking things out of the store without paying for them is called shoplifting maam and thats a crime in this state 
yesterday i was running pos at my parttime retail job and right now we have a off a or more purchase coupon floating around out there now our store is known for giving people just about any type of discount but this coupon states one coupon per person per day should be pretty easy right i was about an hour into my shift when a lady comes up with a buggyfull of merchandise which i quickly scan and bag for her i get to the end where i ask if she has any coupons and she hands me a stack of those off coupons im thinking oh yeah she thinks shes going to get her entire purchase for free gtme im sorry but i can only accept one of these coupons today as it is one per person per day gtlady clearly agitated um no i spent a lot of time picking out things to buy and you can use these all at one time gtme again im really sorry but it is a one per day kind of coupon im happy to take off your purchase but i cant take all of these then i get this response gtlady but my daughter works here and she said i could do it before anyone asks i specifically didnt ask who her daughter was because i didnt want to get accused of trying to get her in trouble but the story works out in the end i promise i went over the policy again my manager close by but didnt intervene since she could see i was handling it alright the lady seemed to accept the information after a few minutes i also showed where it stated it on the coupon she paid said thank you and went about her merry way couple hours later i went on break and was sitting in the break room with another pos person who was up with me when this situation happened and a floor person we were just chatting when the floor person said gtfloor person oh let me tell yall my mom came in earlier and said she got this really rude snappy b of a cashier ringing her out i knew this was me lol she kept giving the details up to the coupons and i was positive it was me gtme oh that was me and i was very polite to your mother i explained our policy to her and she walked out happy the other pos lady was nodding in agreement with me gtfloor person ohlooking a little like a deer caught in headlightsthat was you gtme yeah and she said her daughter told her that we could take as many coupons as the customer wanted it doesnt work that way i was put in a pretty odd situation because i needed to know who her daughter was but i was actually trying to not make a big deal about it with so that you the employee could stay out of trouble you might want to know who people are before talking about them and calling them bs shes only im clearly older than her by a lot lol who opens their mouth when they dont know who people are crazy oh and shes not on the schedule anymore after this week but that was before it had nothing to do with me but she doesnt necessarily know that
i work at a major national liquor store in the us a customer comes up to me c do you have whiskey brand me sorry no its very hard to come by c you never have it why dont you just buy more of it so you can give your customers what they want me unfortunately they cant keep up with demand they didnt know it would be so popular when they started making it c why dont they just make more me i assure you they are c well how long does it take to make me years it didnt click only anger was present on her face for a solid five seconds finally her eyes showed a slimmer of revelation she leaned away from my counter turned around and left the store or at least tried to she proceeded to walk through our entrance only side that has big signs saying entrance only no exit the doors didnt open she stopped just inches from the sliding doors in bewilderment i couldnt hold it in anymore i let a snorting exhale of brief laughter that could not have made that woman more red with anger and embarrassment

im a manager at a charity shop this just happened woman comes in to return a pair of trousers that dont fit her husband we do take returns for that reason but they have to still be in the condition we sold them so they can go back on the rail they need to have our tag still attached obviously otherwise ppl would wear things then return them or return cheaper items in place of what they bought and get their money back for instance buying a pair of mamps trousers bringing us a pair of primark trousers they dont want and getting back what they paid on the mamps ones i tell the woman she cant have the return she leaves and comes back with her husband hes a big guy im a woman he starts agressively demanding the return shouting that it doesnt matter that the tags not attached im not budging the tag has to be attached long story short he throws the trousers at me calls me a fat b and storms out i burst into tears behind the counter i despair i really despair i get up every morning take two trains to work i submit course work late to dedicate myself to this job i repeated a year of uni to keep doing this i work hours a day in a freezing shop with no running water and no heating to provide an essential service to people and i do it for no pay we hand out free clothes to people who need it we provide an address for homeless people to get their mail we supply cheap secondhand goods for people who cant afford new and this is the second time this week ive been called a b by a customer im sitting in our upstairs office in tears right now and im just so exhausted i cant quit cos the shop would close two managers have quit in the last months i cant carry on like this much longer cos i cant cope edit i guess i have to carry on looking at these replies pretty much reinforces my knowledge that im the only one who can do this job right now you all think its so easy to quit to just walk away from people who need you you think that what makes a job worth it is the money if this job was paid i would have walked away long ago you think that its worth abandoning a necessary service to complete a degree and then what why do you think im doing a degree in the first place i chose a subject that will always put me in the centre of helping people i will always work with the most desperate do the jobs that most people will walk away from and i will always do it for low or no pay and when i look for support or empathy when i remind people that even if you think im making a bad decision in carrying on im not some worthless idiot who should take everything thrown at her or an emotionless rock who can always take everything thrown at her i know that people will always tell me to quit 
okay blah blah longtime lurker firsttime whatever here we go background this was a few years ago at a gourmet grocery store the quotes are for the fact that my store was owned by the dominant local chain and they had decided that they were tired of getting their asses kicked by whole foods in the highend market so they converted and rebranded one of their stores that was down the street from a whole foods problem being this is in a city in which three blocks makes all the difference whole foods was located near an art supply house a highend wine distributor and a faux dive bar that people went to ironically my store was located near a lot of graffiti a wino and a real dive bar that people went to to get stabbed in the neck with a broken bottle and inside it was a dressedup version of the same shitty grocery store it had always been so one day im working at the meat counter i moved departments a lot my official job title was specialist my job was to help out whoever needed it and a rather wealthylooking woman wandered into my sightline she had a nice cardigan an overlytaut and expressionless face and she had a cranky posture that all taken together set off every asshole alarm bell that i had developed from years of dealing with customers excuse me young man but i need a rack of lamb of course maam i have some new zealand right here some american over here and i can check in the back because i think we have some argentinian if you prefer this store was huge on customer service and knowledgeable employees i mean whole foods has those things so we need to as well right yesi see the ones in the case there but they wont do well as i said i think i have some in the back are they bigger bigger no maam im sorry the argentinian are fairly small the biggest we have is the american here no those wont work i need longer now these were full racks thirteen or fourteen ribs depending on which ones where they came from and how they were cut longer as in more ribs yes yes longer at this point she started shouting as if i were either deaf or willfully obtuse and holding her hands about shoulder width apart i am having ten people over for dinner and im giving them each two lamb chops plus myself thanks i wasnt sure youd be eating at your own dinner party okay that isnt a problem i can make sure you have full chops it will just have to be on two different racks no thats not acceptable wellllif youre worried about cooking times i can make sure that theyre the same size ill actually have the butcher break down a new lamb just to ensure no not acceptable im doing a crown finally thank every god that has ever existed and ever will exist i now know what i can do to make this customer happy oh thats not a problem they can be tied endtoend with butchers twine to make one continuous roast ill even do it for you before you go if you would like at this point the lady started talking to me as if i were about threequarters stupid not ackseptubull it has to be one piece of meat find me a roast with ribs i know you can do it why wont you help me maam lambs only have a dozen or so ribs theyre an animal they look a certain way i cant create a lamb that has ribs per side i can make you a crown roast with ribs but that is the best i can do honestly i have no idea why i had to add the honestly bit in there i think that she thought i was just trying to keep the mutantfreak lamb all for my personal use not oh fuck where did she pick this phrase up at this point i said fuck customer service and kinda blew up me it herack me does her sept me not her uh me exist her bul after this little backandforth she looks at me and blinks a few times like she just awoke from a dream of dachshundsheep hybrids cavorting in the pasture she pats my hand and says its okay honey ill go ask at whole foods they always know what theyre talking about epilogue about an hour later the meat department phone rings its the butcher from whole foods who i knew enough to nod to on the sidewalk butcher hey man did you just have some crazy bitch in there asking about rib lamb roasts me i dont know man its been pretty crazy here today i mean i field that question at least a dozen times an afternoondid she use the word unacceptable a lot butcher fuck you did you send this crazy bitch down here me no i couldnt help her and she said shed go talk to you since you are far more knowledgeable than i howd you handle it butcher i told her you were an idiot and then i wired two roasts together and covered the wire with bread crumbs and herbs later loser click tldr a customer wants me to invent a time machine go back to the beginning of mammals and alter the course of evolution edit you always miss one letter dont you

i was working in a department store when an elderly couple called me over and asked me to pick up a heavy box of tiles for them while i was lifting it they were talking about the weight of the boxes of tile wife why do they make the boxes so heavy i feel bad for the workers that have to carry them all the time husband its ok maybe it will help him decide he wants to go to college instead of do this the rest of his life i usually worked nights so i didnt really know how to deal with rude customers so instead of just letting it be i responded i tried that wasnt my thing thats why im about to leave for bootcamp that shut him up but i felt bad after seeing the look of sheer embarrassment on his wifes face she apologized and i came to find out that he was ex navy himself thats when i realized that sometimes when a customer is being rude the people with them are the ones that feel the worst about it
at first i thought this old lady was one of those people who cant make up their mind deliberately in order to get attention you know those people they um and er but never challenge anything you say because they dont want to get in trouble just kinda talk for a while even if its akward and weird talk but anyway thats how this lady talked until she started getting side tracked gtcustomer i wanted to get this on canvas but do you know how much they wanted for it its so expensive even for one this size they wanted so much for it i was like my and they said i had to wait two weeks and they wanted for it for a canvas this size it took a couple of tries to get her to pay for one laminate because she didnt want to pay for two together one was already done one needed to be done they were only each but she insisted on paying for one and then the other one later shed kept on talking this whole time about fairly uninteresting and irrelevant subjects until she had a great idea gtcustomer there should be a factory you can go to where you can tell them exactly what you want and they do it for you on the spot and its really cheap gtme well gtcustomer wouldnt that be good gtme yeah i mean itd be ideal gtcustomer maybe this company should have a factory where you can go and get whatever you want you just tell them and they do it for you right away gtme im sure that would be a great addition to the business gtcustomer im sure there are places on the internet you can go that i havent been me im sure there are gtcustomer where you can do something like that maybe you can even buy them online i think you can you know gtme you mean you can buy factories online gtcustomer no canvases im sure there must be but itd just be so nice to be able to go there and that its really cheap me i know what you mean i went to a car dealership the other day and they wanted for a car customer really me yeah and i said mister ive only got in my pocket this would be a lot easier if it were cheaper customer well thats different

so a little background first i used to work as a cashier for a high end all naturalorganic grocery store we dealt with the snobbiest of the snobby as we were in a wealthy area of socal while i was there i was playing poker full time as well using the earnings from this job to cover me in the event of a losing night so one day i had this customer with his cart loaded to brim with everything from cookies to vitamins i can already tell his bill is gonna be somewhere between something easy to do in the store immediately the guy starts being a snob ordering me to empty his basket while he stood there on his phone texting the whole time he had me fetch several other items for him as well not bothering to unload while i was gone it took me a solid minutes to ring up his items and another to bag it all up as he refused to lift finger so finally when this all said and done his bill comes out to a little over this man had the audacity to sneer at me and say thats it pfft and proceeded to slide his card after punching in his info his card was declined he looked at me like i just took a shit on his chest he said run it again so after more attempts i finally ask him do you maybe have another card you can use this one doesnt seem to be working he responded with dont take that tone with me i make more money in a week than you do in a year run my damn card after several more attempts he demanded to talk to my manager proclaiming it was my fault his card was declining after having my manager run his card several more times to the same result he just exploded with rage calling us criminals and that he was going to boycott the store i was so frustrated and finally had enough with this asshole and exclaimed watch this i took out my debit card ran it through the machine typed in my pin and to his shock it went through he started stammering in shock i can only imagine what was going through his mind that this lowly cashier was able to buy his groceries no problem he promptly left the store and never came back needless to say my manager was shocked and i got a refund on all the groceries fuck people for looking down their noses at cashiers edit after reading some of the comments i decided to clarify the customer did not leave with the groceries he promptly exited the store i got my refund and the items were returned to their shelves edit spellinggrammar may have missed something

i make the rotisserie chickens at a major grocery store chain and today a woman came up to me and said i bought one of these here yesterday and one of the wings was missing which fine its a mistake that happens sometimes i was off yesterday so it wasnt my fault but thats not the point im about to apologize for that inconvenience etc but then she adds dont you know how to do your job why was the wing missing and it was a horrible rude tone so i said we dont discriminate against the physically handicapped she eventually complained and i was scolded i hate this job 
i work at a chain corner store slash retail pharmacy usually working checkout in the front yesterday i was only an hour into my shift when i saw a young boy walk in maybe or and head right to the candy isle i didnt see his parents walk in so i kept an eye on him while he did his candy hunting after about minutes he came up to my register and set down pieces of candy and asked me how much it all was i rang it up and it was about but he only had in quarters i told him this and he looked a little discouraged and went back to find some different candy another minutes passes and he comes back up with some smaller but cheaper candy and asked me to ring it up again this time it was and i gave him some of my pocket change so he could keep the candy as the receipt was printing i asked him where his parents were he gave me the biggest and toothiest smile and said mommy says im a big boy now i can get my own candy then he ran to the exit with this bag full of candy i decided to follow him because a it wasnt busy and b because i assumed he had walked from home to the store or something similar turns out his mother was waiting right outside and had been watching our exchange the whole time the mom sent the boy to her van and told me she was trying to teach him to be more independent i guess giving him some autonomy to buy his own candy was a start i went back to the register with a smile on my face for the rest of the day because i can only imagine how good that candy must have tasted when you pick it out yourself and pay with your own money sometimes its the little things

ok so my latest tale was well received and so i thought i might share my favorite moment in the long and multifaceted job history that is mine and it stars a decently famous person to boot when i was ten i had the fortunate experience to begin work at a semi well known theater in waterford ct where many a star and playwright began their careers this is a place that holds a coveted playwrights conference each year during the summer where many promising writers compete to have their best work fine tuned into masterpieces the pieces are given to promising young actors who work the plays each night script in hand rife with changes in front of live audiencesbare props simple setsjust the work each morning mentor directors and scriptwriters work with the playwright to interpret audience reactions and tweak the scripts till they shine its a fun spontaneous place to work fortunately my mother worked in the small print shop and after a few weeks of hanging around the theaters i was give a job as an usher it was an unpaid gig but it guaranteed entry and killer seats to any and all the plays during the seasonand as a kid who loved theater it was better than money i worked there from the age of ten till i graduated high school and loved every minute i have a hundred stories from those summer nights but one stands out from the rest two summers in there came a time when our awesome stage manager had to quit for another gig being the most senior of the present ushers and mature for my age the managers of the theater asked if i would step in for a night or two while they filled the positiontwo days become a week and a week became a month and i was doing a really good job but my hopes of keeping the gig were dashed when they filled the position with the mother of all insecure powerheady bitches she hated me from the moment she realized that a twelve year old had essentially been doing her joband she made sure to remind me of my place whenever possible often after saving myself a seat with my jacket i would find it moved as the lights turned down for the performance her excuse only legitimate customers should have decent seats despite our unpaid status soon i could only hope to get a middle orchestra seat if i stealthily did it when she wasnt looking the hate was becoming seriously mutual and i had begun to think of quitting but i had to wait till the end of the month because i wanted to see one play in particulara musical version of fahrenheit besides being one of my favorite books i had been watching the rehearsals for weeks and the score was amazing it had two of my friends in it and it was rumored that the playwright had even invited ray bradbury to come to opening nightand he had accepted i wasnt going to miss it for anything that night turned out to have one of the harshest thunderstorms of the summer for ct it was pouring and the wind was fierce i had been extra careful reserving a seat for myselfor at least i thought i had and it was a half hour from curtain suddenly my bitch manager appeared out of nowhere and demanded i go to the mansion to tell mr bradburys agent that it was time to get seated now let me explain the mansion this theater was built on the grounds of an old estate in waterford it had several amphitheaters and the main stage was in a converted barn where tonights performance was about a quarter of a mile across the estate lay the mansion that housed the theater offices lounges and the cafeteria she essentially wanted me to run a quarter of a mile in the pouring rain to ask a guest to come downdespite the fact that there were phones when i tried to argue she threatened my position i was pissed but i began to run i show up breathless at the lounge in the mansion to see a piggish man finishing the vestiges of a huge meal he hardly acknowledges me when i speak to him and then tells me that im dismissed by this point im getting way too pissed to even speak so i run back to the barn sopping wet its almost curtain time and as soon as i hit the barn i scan for my jacket and my seatonly to find them moved to the back railing its now standing room only which we allowed with our informal nature and im done completely i look around and see my manager speaking to a grey haired gentleman in the front row i quickly walk to where they are standing and my presence naturally draws their attention i tell my manager that ive done what shes asked and im going home she actually smirks and walks away turning around to leave the gentleman saysarent you staying for the play its supposed to be wonderful i sigh and without thinking i tell him that ive just had the worst night ever lost my seat to an ungrateful boss gotten sopping wet tracking down an ego case at the mansion and that even though i was looking forward to itwell its obvious that its time to go home he suddenly says im so sorry my agent really is a self righteous ass isnt he thats when i realize who im talking tomr bradburyhimself between the self pity and him being a lot older than pics id seen of him i hadnt even recognized him i begin to apologize profusely for being so candid but he wont hear any of itinstead he starts looking around and motioning for my bitch manager to come over mr bradbury suddenly all business this young lady is sitting with me this eveningi will need a towel and another seat right here in the aisle bitchy manager but sir she cant sit hereit breaks fire codes and besides shes an uusher mr bradbury i dont give a crap about fire codesshes sitting here or im not staying now get her a towel and a chair she looks at me i look at her i smile a smile three miles wide she sighs and slinks off she ever so humbly returns with the requested items but this time cant make eye contact i beam mr bradbury gesturing to a seat dead front and center my lady shall we enjoy the show i didnt walki floated and that my friends is how i got to spend an evening watching the coolest musical ever sitting right next to mr ray bradbury discussing with him the finer points of the musical during intermission and chuckling about how annoying his agent and my boss could be after that night my manager basically gave up being rude to me she didnt last long after that and i went on to spend many a wonderful summers there

looking back i realize how fucked up this was but at the time i was just trying to earn a living being a broke college student just a warning this is long and a bit gross biologicallywise i was working at a fast food restaurant and had been there for over a year it was a pretty strict clockwork method place and although there was no love or compassion there it gave me hours even though it was nice money i wanted to quit for a while just never had a reason or an alternative route to go to until one night i was a closer basically a shitty shift but the only thing a full time college student can do store would close at pm and id be out around its around pm and im doing preclose minding my own business when the manager on that we will call a asked me to go clean the bathrooms i said sure why not something i was used to doing i go into the womens bathroom and open up the first stall to find it stuff with toilet paper now ive seen worse so i just shrug and flush we had some pretty intense toilets so i figured it would go down this is about to get gross and disturbing turn back now if you dont want to know it didnt instead the toilet paper rolled and revealed a massive amount of blood like a crazy amount of clotted and unclotted blood being an yearold female i knew that this was way too much blood for a menstrual cycle my mind going blank i tried to flush it again when i noticedpieces i looked a little closer and realize i was looking at a super tiny hand like the littlest hand ive ever seen this was when it hit me that this was something i didnt want to see i hightailed my ass out of there and went to the manager a there is something in the bathroomi cant be in there you have to call the gm now the gm of the store was a mega bitch but i figured you kind of have to be a mega bitch to work in a huge corporation like she did we will call her s a on the other hand is the same age as me having had started working at the store when he was and made his way up to manager he was a nice guy and someone i considered a friend i didnt realize until a told me to come to back to the break room that i was near tears subconsciously i probably realized that what was in the toilet was what it was but it hadnt quite hit reality yet ok under what is in there so i can call s a says as he is trying to calm me down i walked in and there was lots of blood and bits and pieces and i begin to have to wipe tears from my eyes and im still not sure why but i felt stupid for doing it at the time he calls the gm while i compose myself in the break room he comes back a few minutes late and sighs really loudly s said there isnt anything we can do but flush it i blankly stared at him and was waiting for him to tell me to leave it be till the cleaning crew got there in an hour he then tells me that i need to go back and flush it i tried to explain i couldnt do it and he handed me a box of the cheap blue gloves we used to handle food and walked away i then learned two things this job sucked ass and a was not my friend my other two coworkers just stared at me as i walked through the kitchen to the bathrooms i kept randomly crying and couldnt figure out why a was ever so kind enough to put a closed for cleaning sign up on the door i walked back in and once again saw this little hand and immediately walked out i went back to the counter and a asked if it was gone i asked if i could please use one of the heavy maintenance gloves he said no i then pleaded for him to send someone else to do it my male coworker piped up from the back and said he would do it but a told me to go back and just get it over with i flushed and flushed and eventually the toilet paper mass must have broken up for it finally went down the drain im really not sure how long it took but it felt like and enternity i stayed silent the rest of the night and the next morning when i woke up i knew that it was the final straw i called work told the gm i was done and wasnt coming in that night to close she asked why and i told her after last night i couldnt face that place she informed me that if i quit without a twoweek notice i would be banned from working at any of the stores that bared that name i was ok with that to receive my last paycheck id have to turn in my uniform and give a written notice why i quit i walked in during supper rush and s the gm handed me the paper to write i wrote im quitting because i was forced to flush a late term miscarriage down the toilet s tore it up and handed me another paper and told me to rewrite it i wrote the same thing she told me to stop being silly and i loudly asked why it was wrong to write that they made me flush the miscarriage down the toilet yes i did it in front of a crowd and no i didnt really care she was so embarrassed that she handed me my paycheck and walked away i havent been back there since i still dont really understand why i was so upset i lived on a small farm as a child and was raised around hunters i saw death and butchering all the time i guess just seeing something unfamiliar in a very familiar place was just nerve wracking i now know that it was a pretty late term miscarriage maybe a home abortion but i try not to think like that probably around to weeks im guessing that the person was pretty scared and didnt know what to do and just left i like to tell myself she didnt mean to leave it behind and make me deal with it either way it was a pretty bad time tldr college job made me flush a late term miscarriage down the toilet would not do again edit i just got back from my daylong prenatal class and really wasnt expecting this response im going to try and answer as many questions as i can one recurring question ive noticed is why did i do it to begin with i was scared this was my first job and my mind kind of shut down the other questions is if a knew it was a miscarriage i made him well aware that it was and i kept telling him about the tiny hand i left out in detail how i became a bit hysterical when i came back from my first visit lastly i would really love to tell everyone the corporations name but i dont want to be banned from this subreddit its my absolutely favorite place to vent i know that this has a struck a huge cord with a lot of people and that some would like to boycott i cant say that this would be the choice for all of the stores in this franchise and dont want people to presume the actions of one store reflects the whole company as a whole i think the reason why they made me flush it was the store was relatively new and had yet to even make a profit the idea of a scandal probably scared the gm i think its too late to report it now as it has been nearly years thank you all for the messages and the concerns and ill get back to you folks later tonight 
yesterday before my shift i noticed it was pretty dead so i approached the register and made idle smalltalk with my coworker she was pretty much done cleaning up my station and we were just talking about how gross the pastries in our display start looking caloriesugar content wise after youve worked there for a while so were talking for a few minutes not long at all before an older woman who had been seated at the bar by our espresso just staring at us started almost screaming out excuse me excuse me hey my coworker who well call sunny turned and walked over to her and asked her how can i help you today the woman stared at her for a few moments before saying are you done talking and ready to take my order id really hate to inconvenience you sunny handled it pretty well and explained to the lady that to make a togo order she would need to approach the register and that we dont take those orders from seated customers especially customers who already have bagged up food from whatever they ate dining in which the lady did have several togo boxes already with her the lady made a huge deal of getting up and walking over to the register i decided to clock in while she waddled over to us while i was punching in my number and tying my apron she just stood at the register i was at and stared at me i directed her to the open register and she just stayed where she was i then explained that i wasnt on the clock and sunny will be more than happy to help her she rolled her eyes and barked out mushroom soup i rolled my eyes and asked medium or large large sunny went to the back to make it and i clocked in and rung it up for her the lady kind of wandered over to our display and looked at it for a while she came back to my register i was standing at the open register this time and just stood there i was still in a pretty decent mood despite how short and abnormally rude she was being so i remained casual and waited for her order she finally says you need to take your hand out of your pocket this is a terrible habit of mine i always keep my left hand in my pocket and ring people up with my right now because i dont handle food without gloves on no one ever says anything about it but i had the strong feeling that this wasnt really a big deal to her at this point something i did or said when i walked in the door made her hate me i dont know what it was but it was something i took my hand out of my pocket and raised my eyebrows in a kay lets get this show on the road so you can gtfo kind of manner and she proceeded to say i want one creme brulee we have three different kinds of creme brulee i asked if she wanted the one with sprinkles berries or vanilla she just rolled her eyes and said the creme brulee duh so i just gave her whatever was in the back of the throw out in an hour slightly smashed up against a metal rail in the cooler creme brulee and packaged her soup before ringing her up she placed her money directly on the counter in front of my register where i couldnt reach it so i had to come around to the front and pick it up and take it back to my till where i finished the transaction and put the money back on the counter and slid it over to her she took it pocketed it and grabbed her bag then she said can i have your name out of curiosity i just had to ask why what have i done wrong besides put my hand in my pocket she then looked at me with this look of pure hatred that i cant explain and said this isnt your goddamn social hour you come here to work not talk about how gross your food is not to flaunt off how skinny you are and not to show off your political views this is work remember that when corporate fires you and you have to find a job at some other restaurant i was shocked sure my coworker and i discussed the calorie count in our desserts but my political views so being bold again i asked im sorry i understand that i did in fact make comments about the calorie count in our desserts and im truly sorry if it offended you though im just curious as to when i stated my political views she then said i saw that nra sticker on the back of your truck when you pulled in you represent this company and now im never eating here again in fact youre pretty mouthy go get your manager the nra sticker on the back of my husbands truck but fine whatever i got my manager who explained to her that a tiny almost invisible round sticker with the letters nra on it was not grounds to get me fired neither was discussing the calories in an item and that her behavior was inappropriate and turning into harassment and that he would appreciate it if she left the rest of the night was fine but damn i think she just didnt like me

 this happened about years ago and we had a guy come in wearing a long trench coat first off this odd attire made security follow him and he walks around the store looking at stuff and does not buy anything the woman greeting at the door she was a very nice woman and everyone in the store loved her she tells the guy to have a nice day as he walks past her the man stops and turns around pulls open the jacket she quickly throws her reading glasses on and loudly says oh how cute but sweetheart ive seen bigger on a puppy she and her late husband used to breed dogs the man turned beet red and security caught him called the cops and had him arrested half the front end of the store saw this because she was loud when she said it making heads turn there was much laughter after this happened 
background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of july and new years eve story someone else had posted a good about a shopper showing up at closing time and just browsing it reminded me of this story as you can imagine we get crazy as hell the closer it gets to the th of july i try to staff accordingly but of course things never go as you plan them july nd should have been a very busy day for us what it actually turned out to be was a madhouse and we did almost twice the business i had forecasted im not complaining there were a lot of high fives given that day but after being on my feet for hours i was damn tired we had closed the store at pm an hour after we were supposed to i had sent home the cashiers around pm since they were supposed to be back at am the next morning and the only people left were my dad one of my employees and me we turned off the lights lowered the sides of the tent and locked up the fence i was walking to my car with the cash drawer when a car pulled up the guy was a regular customer and a friend he was having a party and wanted to grab just a few things i felt bad for him so we unlocked the fence and walked back inside he started running around and grabbing the stuff he wanted while i put the cash drawer back in the register of course two minutes later a group of people walk into the tent i told them we were closed and that they had five minutes to shop figuring thats about what it would take my friend to finish and then the human tsunami hit i dont know where the hell they were coming from but people started pouring into the tent this is a tough situation first im there to make money but i was tired as hell i still had to swing by the bank for a drop and i didnt really have the staff to handle the crowd i sucked it up and started ringing in sales as fast as i could around pm i announced to the few remaining shoppers that they had minutes left at pm im trying to get the last two people out of the damn tent theyve obviously been partying and theyre just taking their time browsing at theyre holding maybe of stuff in their hands and just laughing and stumbling around i finally cant take it anymore i walk up to the couple and tell them that were closed and that they need to check out now if they want to buy anything the guy immediately gets an attitude and tells me that theyre not done shopping yet i get an attitude and explain to him that yes in fact they are he drops his stuff on the floor in front of me and heads for the door as the couple is walking out a truck pulls up im tired hungry and ready for a shower as the guy is stepping out of the truck i dont even bother to look up and just call out were closed guy come on man i want to pick up some stuff me we were supposed to close at pm its and im ready for bed youll have to come back tomorrow we open at am guy yeah but its going to be busy tomorrow i dont like shopping when its crowded me its going to be a madhouse tomorrow id get here early if i were you guy cant you just let me get my stuff now a friend of mine told me about your place and said you guys could just put a package together for me i want to spend around me welcome to ltmy company namegt come on in were open if youre interested ive posted a few other stories

i work in a grocery store at the customer service desk needless to say that i get at least two customers a day that are pissed about something a regular comes up to the desk one evening with her teenaged daughter i had never had a problem with her before but she was never really friendly either she is looking at her receipt with that look that i hate to see its not going to be a simple return or price fix its going to be a speech about how were literally stealing or dishonest or evil it was actually going to be worse she pulls out a gift card and looks at it we sell all sorts of gift cards most of them you pay and get credit on the card however the prepaid visa mastercard or american express cards have an additional fee on them it is a bank fee it does not go to our store or even the credit card companies anyway there is a sign by them that informs customers of this charge there is also a sign that says that gift cards are nonrefundable she looks at me and asks why did you charge me i explain to her how it works the whole time she is unfazed i didnt know that you should really tell customers that before they buy the cards otherwise youre stealing their money i should have just agreed but on occasion i get a wild streak in me and feel the need to lash out maam it is posted on a sign by the cards no its not i would have seen it alright bitch lets go take a look i escort her over to the gift card rack and try my hardest to suppress the smug look on my face as i gesture vanna white style to the sign she is still completely emotionless as she holds the card out towards me i want to return it then im not paying for i then gesture to the other sign on the other side of the rack her eyes scan the sign and then her face contorts into an awful visage of pure malice she holds it out towards me once more i dont care i dont want this card i want my money back some people are starting to look over but strangely her daughter is absorbed in her phone ignoring us completely i inform her that i can call a manager but unless something is wrong with the card they wont be able to do anything for her she and i am not kidding starts stomping her foot on the ground and screaming thats not fair over and over in an incredibly shrill voice i hear a manager being paged up and customers and employees are staring her daughter looks up at me for one brief moment and mouths im sorry so i assume that this is not an isolated incident the manager comes up and this lady is still flipping out shes not shouting anymore but she is still looking at the card for any out and stomping that foot my manager asks what the issue is and the customer is getting tongue tied trying to explain what happened you stole from me and i want it back i dont want this she is waving the gift card all over the place the manager informs her curtly that we have a no refund policy for gift cards this is not exactly what the customer wanted to hear she throws the card on the grounds and screams like shes being stabbed everyone is gathering around watching the whole store has gone silent the daughter is still on her phone this lady is like a banshee i will never shop here again i cant believe i fell for this she then storms out of the store with her daughter behind her my manager is wideeyed watching her leave other customers are also in shock im trying not to crack up i pick up the gift card and bring it back to the service desk life goes on about five minutes later who should walk in but the daughter she asks for the gift card which i give to her i cant let her leave without asking is she like that a lot to which the daughter responds no usually its worse she goes on to explain that her mom has knocked stuff off shelves spit on people and had the cops called on her twice in fact the reason she didnt do any of that this time was because she had a pending trial for assault lucky us my favorite part of this story and any story in which the customer swears to never return is that she still shops she didnt even give it a week based on what her daughter said maybe were the only grocery store that still lets her in
by cutting my hours once as backstory i had been at that store for years and had seen like five managers come and go i was tired of us going through managers so when this new one well call her bitchy i decided to give her polite pointers as to where other managers had messed up just simple things like x item sells very well at this store so we should make sure we have enough sundays are actually very busy and we got in trouble for not having enough help those days last manager got in trouble for always forgetting x anything i thought could help her stay a while bitchy always took that the worst way like i was calling her incompetent when really i just wanted her to do well i mean that might be annoying of me but i think its clear to see that i meant well and was only trying to save her ass from trouble with the strict store director she hated me we always butted heads and shes the type of person who if shes mad she wants to fight it out and make a scene pretty shitty tbh at that job i always felt overworked constantly busy and tired on my days off one day i pissed her off dont remember what it was something petty so my crazy boss thought i would be heartbroken over having a whole weekend off seriously you punish me with a weekend thanks i had to fight to keep my smile from showing bitchy comes up to me shortly after she made the schedule and goes the new schedules up you should take a look seriously bitch you want to cut my hours and then rub it in my face here we go then i stay upbeat i know i get the weekend off i think im going to do a date night on saturday ive been wanting to go see this new movie for weeks she freezes looks pissed goes ok good then works out for everyone and walks off the other employees all start talking about what theyd do if they had the weekend off movies restaurants activities etc that sound like fun theyre all teasing me asking me to trade them and were just all laughing and enjoying ourselves while we work not one hour later she comes back going hey something came up i need you to work saturday and sunday i grin even harder ok great i could totally use the extra hours and oh my god the look on her face was priceless she realized she couldnt win whether she took or gave my hours she spent the rest of the day in a pissy mood avoiding me it was awesome the best part she did that to a lot of people many who would beg for their hours back so i guess she realized that was a great source of power she tried that on me no less than more times throughout that year every time met with a happy me no matter what it was amazing edit tldr manager tries to cut my hours out of spite instead of being upset i get really excited to have extra days off so she redoes the schedule so i work those days again edit thanks for the comments everyone you guys have been great a few of you have mentioned that i should apply to be a manager and im really flattered at that im currently about to be trained for a managementtype position my badge will say manager but mostly ill be doing peoplemanagement giving breaks and lunches with not a lot of money responsibility and after i graduate i will be more seriously looking into advancing my career 
well like my title says i do believe i have found the holy grail sought after by retail workers and frustrated parents alike my friends i have found a surefire way to make bad children instantly behave themselves allow me to set the scene its a slow evening at the dollar store and a couple walk in with their yearold daughter right from the getgo this kid is being a bratosaurus rex and her poor parents are just trying to get the things they need and get out of the store five or ten minutes later they come up to my register to check out the little girl is holding a toy that her parents are going to purchase for her but she absolutely refuses to put the toy on the belt for me to scan after much wheedling and coaxing from her parents she finally parts with the toy i scan it put it in a bag and give it to her saying here you go sweetie you can have your toy in your very own bag she takes the bag and says nothing heres where it gets good the dad then says to her arent you going to say thank you to the lady well apparently not the little girl says nothing and buries her face in her mothers skirt but not before shooting her parents and me a look of pure malice youre not going to say thank you presses the dad silence once more the mom then goes honey thats not very polite if you dont want to say thank you then we can take this toy and give it back to the lady the little girl then shouted thank you at me with as much venom as a fouryearold could possibly muster honestly it was hilarious as all hell and had her parents not been trying to parent her i probably would have cracked up but no she was rude and her parents were determined to make her pay the price thats it her dad declared that was not nice of you at all we are definitely giving the toy back now granted the kid was being bratty and i wanted her to learn her lesson but i didnt want her to have to give the toy back thats all right sir she just doesnt know about the santacams up there i said pointing at the ceiling hes always watching upon hearing that the little girls attitude did a complete she removed her face from her mothers skirt looked at me with puppydog eyes and said in the most polite and contrite voice thank you i smiled at her and said youre very welcome and proceeded to inform her that santa has cameras in all the stores so shed better be good wherever she goes as they were paying and getting ready to leave the dad smiled at me and whispered good one never before had i managed to get a small child to behave so quickly and i must say that i am quite impressed with myself the funny part we dont actually have any cameras in our store the thing that i was pointing at was actually the sprinkler oh well the kids dont have to know that 
edit new story is up the destroyer in which the op is brutalized by a hello again talesfromretail my previous story the chicken nugget received so much positive attention that i thought another story was needed about a year after the aforementioned incident i was working the saturday night drivethru shift again it was fairly busy as saturday evenings tend to be a very shiny rental car pulls up to the ordering microphone and the driver begins ordering he has a very thick french accent and i have trouble understanding him as the microphone is already in terrible condition i ask him to repeat his order a few times he is clearly agitated by the time he completes his order a few minutes later he pulls up to the drivethru window i walk over to take his payment he informs me that he wants to change his order hi my wife does not want number anymore she wants number now change it please also add two milkshakes i inform him that i will be happy to change his order but that there will be a small additional wait he mutters something under his breath i ignore the comment and begin making the milkshakes i hear him and his wife conversing in french through the window now i took french in high school i was by no stretch of the imagination a good student madame durand despaired that i only did enough work to squeak by with a c every semester however i could still make out phrases of the couples conversation and sometimes entire sentences sad excuse for a restaurant stupid white boy should go to university they both laugh at this moment i hatch a brilliant idea i cant speak french that well but i can well enough to get the point across i begin recalling nouns and verbs from the many hours spent in french class madame durand would have been proud i take the payment for the order hand over the food to the driver and prepare myself as he reaches for the milkshakes i say to him in broken french i hope you enjoy your meal sir it was a pleasure to serve you today he looks at me and gets that terrified deerintheheadlights look of someone caught redhanded his eyes begin to bulge out of his head my grin is wider than that of a jackolantern im afraid that if my smile gets any wider the top of my head will fall off then the best thing that could possibly happen happened you know when your eye starts twitching randomly and it just wont stop it always happens during a job interview or a date and its the worst thing ever my eye started twitching now not a little minitwitch where you can hope the other person didnt notice but a fullon berserker rage twitch my eyelid was threatening to jump off my face and start a life of its own this guy definitely noticed it it was beautiful a great interstellar drama spread across his face as his brain recategorized me from obnoxiously cheerful food worker to twitching psychopath whom i just insulted this man wasted no time eyes bulging he made a sound that can only be described as a strangled grunt and slammed the vehicle into gear not one to waste food he seized both milkshakes from my hands and tossed them into his wifes lap her shrieking protests mixed with the squealing tires on the pavement i never saw either of them again if enough people express interest i can also tell the story of how i was beaten up by a yearold
short and sweet i work in one of the big supermarkets in australia i was filling the bread today when i saw a customer sneeze and proceed to blow his nose on a tissue without a second though he dropped it on the ground me excuse me sir you dropped your tissue him and me well arent you going to pick it up him no isnt that your job me no i dont see why i have to pick up your snotty tissues if you like theres a bin less than m away behind you him you cant talk to me like that let me speak to your manager me i am the manger him well whos in charge of you me nobody at the moment im in charge of the entire store and everyone in it right now him fine what is your name im going to report you to your head office me iupvoteyourmum thats with an m our store number is is there anything else i can do for you today he let out an audible groan and picked up his rubbish and walked out of the store ill be looking forward to how he explains how i refused to pick up his biohazard and to see how ill be reprimanded for it
so this happened just a few weeks ago at my now former workplace hurray better job the company i worked for has expectations for a certain percentage of all printers having ink attached to the sale associates can get ridden pretty hard by management over their attachment rates i was doing a circuit of the store looking for customers to help when i saw a man walking down the aisle with just a small printer in his cart i put on my retail smile and paused as he walked past and started on my usual spiel when i see someone buying a printer with nothing else i see you have a nice little laser printer there just so you know those things only have starter toner cartridges that print just a fraction of what a the man whirled around and went bug eyed with an odd expression plastered across his face raised his arms and clapped his hands on either side of his head as he began to shake it back and forth aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i froze in place and just stared at him for a second before doing a quick and noped the heck out of there its probably exactly what he wanted but ive never encountered that specific approach to avoid having to listen to a sales pitch i will admit that it was quite effective
so im at work and were a little less than fifteen minutes away from closing shop ive got my vacuum out my ipod ready and im overall excited to go home suddenly a women in stiletto boots a very short skirt and a belly shirt that doesnt leave too much for the imagination waltzes into the store im not going to beat around the bush it was definitely a prostitute gtp you got green dot gtme actually no we stopped selling them not too long ago gtp what about vanilla one gtme is that like a green dot gtp yeah its the same thing gtme then i really dont think so maam sorry our store stopped selling reload cards weve been getting a lot of scams lately and the store decided it was best to stop honestly id never heard of a vanilla one reload card and what i told her about green dots wasnt a lie i genuinely thought if wed stopped selling green dots wed stop selling all reload cards so then she starts strumming through all of our gift cards and i come to help her because the faster we find or dont find this card the quicker she leaves and then i get to go home after a minute or two of searching we dont find a vanilla one card so then she picks up her phone gtp yeah they aint got any dont get mad at me mhm yeah no the store clerk says they aint got any okay then you come and find them yoself then she hangs up the phone looks at me and says gt p great now hes mad at me so then this scary ass guy barges into my store power walks right to the gift card section grabs a vanilla one reload cardwhoops storms to my counter pays for the card in cash looks at the woman and says gtwe about to have a talk outside and then leaves no thank you no good night just takes his card and storms outside so now its me and the prostitute again we look at each other for a moment and suddenly she gets a little mad gtp great now hes mad at me you made him mad at me this is your fault and when hes mad at me im mad at you whats your name gt me tttanner gtp okay tanner imma remember your name tanner i better not be in trouble tanner if i am then we gonna have that talk outside tanner and then she stormed outside at this time all of my coworkers are staring at me a safe distance away they slowly come to me snickering and as one asks gtwhat just happened all i can say is gti think im gonna get jumped by a hooker after work tonight guys fortunately even after closing we have to clean up shop for two hours so if i was in danger they probably got bored after a half hour of waiting and drove off and thats my tale from retail
alrighty this is the first time posting but ive read all of yalls crazy stories over the years as this was happening i knew i had to post it here here goes i was working as a cashier in the front end of a very popular bluevested retailgrocery store anyways a customer comes up and asks me if we do cash back i said of course if you swipe your card as a debit card you can get up to back she buys a random pack of gum and gets the full back it was a busy sunday morning and for some reason my register was out of dollar bills whatever i had plenty of s she could bring it to customer service for them to cash it if she wanted smaller bills so i hand her a and shut my drawer without even thinking twice i wasnt expecting her to hand it back crazy lady uhh maam i dont want this dollar bill me you asked for cash back on your card thats the amount you requested crazy lady yes but this one is dirty get me a different one me thats not how this works maam i cant open my register because your bill isdirty finally after arguing with her for a good minutes and people lining up behind her she went to customer service and they gave her s you should have seen the look on the faces of the customers behind her who watched the whole ordeal go down they were just as flabbergasted as i was 
i just remembered this from when i used to work at a convenience store we had this promotion where when you buy a coffee before am you get a free pastry decent deal people loved it one morning two guys enter the store one of them gets a coffee the other grabs a red bull and a danish at checkout it went something like this me sir i could scan your friends danish along with your coffee this way the pastry will be free coffee guy sudden distrustful look on his face no thank you red bull guy no man shes right just let her ring the danish with your coffee and itll be free because of that deal they have me thats right if you buy a coffee you get a free danish so if i ring the coffee and danish together you only pay for the coffee coffee guy no thanks im not falling for that me its not a trick sir its just buy a coffee get a free pastry red bull guy come on just let her scan the thing coffee guy shaking his head with a look that says you cant fool me nah this went on for a short while and coffee guy flat out refused to listen still with this smug look like were trying to scam him and hes not letting us he ended up paying for his coffee and his friend paid for his red bull and danish while shaking his head in disbelief i never quite understood that one edit spelling
as a young professional im oftentimes faced with the occasional client that fails to recognize that despite my age i still know my shit most likely i know my shit better than you and thats why youve come to me i work in electronics retail and decided to come out of lurking to share with you the tale of big bob executive a large well dressed man came into my store yesterday with the intention of returning a piece of equipment he won through a contest at work his company purchased the equipment at my store a month prior to the date in question when we make a sale and also printed very clearly on the receipt we inform the client that they have days to return that item for a full refund if the client purchases the equipment with a credit card our only option is to refund their purchase using the same medium they provided for payment bobs return date as printed on the receipt was for two weeks prior to the date he came to my location i talked with bob and informed him that the date of return had been passed a number of weeks ago and that i wouldnt be able to process that return for him he asked if i could provide him with anything at all for it and i told him i could return it to our inventory only for a store gift card at this point after all the package wasnt opened and im not some heartless bastard he asked me why he couldnt simply get his money back i explained to him that it in fact wasnt his money and that the equipment had been purchased by someone else a month beforehand therefore the only people i could return that money to even if a manager provided me with an override was the credit card provided i explained to bob how when someone makes a purchase at a retail store they enter a contract of service between the business and themselves the consumer we as a retail location offer them fourteen days to explore and use their purchases for consideration of returning or exchanging them after those fourteen days the purchaser takes complete ownership of the device now let me reiterate when i said young professional i meant that i appear to be i am a young something bob executive and his apparent business associate whom we will affectionately dub mr jack goff laugh in my face at my response they referred to me as a corporate drone that is obviously too young to understand how things work and forces good people into keeping their money inside their corporation by denying him a refund and then he said something so disrespectful that for the first time in retail i stopped giving a shit about a customer and what happened to them while they were in my care in my store after giving bob a final answer ergo no i will not be giving you cash for this item purchased over a month ago by someone else bob responded verbatim with wrong answer go get me an adult that understands business i immediately halted discussion with the customer and went for the aide of my favorite manager whom we will dub sarah i informed sarah of the situation that the customer was rude and i made it clear that we must hold steadfast in the expectation i had set for him sarah practically repeated every last word of my explanation which i found irony in given that were never taught any process wordforword so to speak its generally left to our discretion sarah was of a similar age so bob and jack goff promptly and blatantly displayed their disgust for children running a retail store he said hed be calling our ceo directly to share his distaste for young people running his stores you can feel any way you want about me based on my age gender sexuality skin color i cant stop you from any of that but dont disrespect me because you dont understand how a business works also you could have just sold the fucking thing yourself

like a roasting pan garlic green beans stuffing the list goes a bit more but you get the gist im actually a little amazed that shes doing this as its literally the last minute so ask why now most people like to get their shopping done early she laughs a little because there is no crowd which was true it was nearly eleven at night there was maybe three other people shopping my crew had been dicking around for the past hour as there was nothing to do she went on to explain that she does this each of the two days before and between the two days she usually gets everything she needs and if she doesnt well tough hooey i make some other dish and we have that for dinner i gotta salute this womans dont give a fuck attitude and her will to live dangerously sidenote to fellow grocery store workers savor this the longest possible time until next thanksgiving
i was looking after the self serve checkout area when a guy came through and started scanning his basket of items i noticed that he scanned a pair of jeans and put them in his bag although the machine registered the jeans as a pair of socks valued at i walked over to find that a bar code sticker had been ripped of a pair of socks and placed over the bar code for the jeans which were actually worth as i voided off the socks and scanned the jeans the customer started to rant that it was false advertising and that he is entitled to get them for to which i explained that he was incorrect and i was not going to give it cue a large number of curse words from him and surprisingly some feet stamping it ended with him buying nothing and storming out of the store vowing that he would never return that vow lasted days
first of all english is my second language so please excuse my mistakes this happened about a year ago a little more this lady called me at my bakery shop and ordered a big stevia birthday cake for about people she was a regular customer and a good one so i didnt ask her to come to the store and pay something in advance now i dont make these cakes so i had to order it from a partner she was aware of that so on the date we agreed i received the cake paid for it and waited for her to come and pick it up but it was getting late so i decided to give her a call and remind her the conversation went like this hi ms b its mpourdes from enter bakery shop name your cake is here will you come and pick it up yourself or perhaps youd prefer it delivered to your house my husband does deliveries for our regular customers who live nearby im sorry what cake the chocolate biscuit stevia cake of kg you ordered for your birthday im sorry but my daughter made the cake for my birthday i didnt order one but ms b you did call me last week and ordered a cake for today i even said that you didnt need to pay anything in advance because i know and trust you at this point she did remember and was in shock oh my god you are right my daughter offered to make the cake a few days after i ordered it and then i completely forgot ah thats ok i said waiting for her to mention payment please accept my apology of course i said well goodbye she replied omg but ms b i received the cake and paid for it out of my own pocket well you will just sell it to someone else i guess its not easy to sell a cake this big that is also made with stevia you need to pay for it how much is it i told her the price and she started crying oh my god poor me i paid so much money for this dinner party i have today i didnt remember about this cake thats a lot of money etc she sounded desperate so i just asked her to give me just what i had paid for the cake without my own profit she continued crying with actual tears or thats what it sounded like because she didnt like this option either i remember the many poormes she cried all this time always about poor her and never about the poor cake lady that actually had to pay for the thing at some point i realized that she would just keep crying and would never pay for anything so i did what i consider a mistake now i said its ok ms b dont cry you are a regular customer and i appreciate the support you have given to my business all these years i will try to sell the cake to someone else have a happy birthday she thanked me many times and said i was an angel i was lucky and did sell that cake for a smaller price of course but guess what i never saw ms b again i guess she felt embarrassed and didnt want to see me again but i cant help but feeling like a fool here i lost a customer after being so nice to her

back in my days in retail i worked at a big uk supermarket as a customer services team leader it was a snow day and the uk wasnt prepared for snow for the fourth year running we were low on colleagues boo low in customers hooray but a high proportion of those customers are those persistent regulars who are just here to cause trouble oh boy so one of the older troublesome gentlemen comes to me at the cs desk and asks for help to get his shopping home hes just had a hip operation therefore he needs help getting his shopping home luckily the local taxi service was still operational as the roads were manageable when driving i pointed him towards the phone to book the taxi so they could pickhim up from the stand as you could only use a booked taxi he refused and this conversation followed gthim no i want you to take me home and into my house gtme me what do you mean come with you in the taxi to your house gthim no its your fault im here shopping when its snowing outside so you have to take me home carry this shopping to my house its minutes walk away but itll be about an hour in the snow now i dont quite understand what hes saying at this point but it sounded like he was blaming me for him choosing to come shopping in the snow gt him ive also just had a hip operation so its your duty to make sure i get home safely gt me so youve had an operation and you want me to risk my health to go walk in the snow to get your shopping to your house because you chose to go shopping on a snow day after youve had an operation gt him yes i pay your wages this is part of your job gt me no it isnt my service ends at the door you made these decisions you need to find your way back home the same way you made it here gt him you must its your fault all of it he started screaming and shouting and gaining everyones attention at this point i just told everyone he wants us to carry his shopping home for him because he cant be bothered to walk in the snow this seemed to subdue the people who decide to get involved after what was an eternity he took the cab in the end but i still to this day dont know how he came to the conclusion that any of this was my fault
hi tfr first post after a year of reading your horror stories ive been working in a grocery store for over a year now and have culminated my own collection of nightmareinducing runins with people hellbent on making everyone around them despise their entire existence warning wall of text below warning wall of text below today i thought id share one that has been in the making for almost a year this story starts with my second day out of training on a register it is currently super doubles week where our store will double the value of coupons up to meaning a coupon is worth for nongrocery workers this is obviously very bad for a new employee because the store gets a very bad case of the crazies and in customers will actively try to scam you to get away with invalid or fake coupons management doesnt seem to mind however and im thrown on a register still quite nervous about learning fast forward hours later im approaching the end of my shift im a little more confident and more proficient with the job and have already seen a lot of really scummy customers i almost feel confident then it comes to my lane barely of shoddilydyed blonde scraggly hair a gucci purse a torn ragged sweater and bunny slippers yes thats right bunny slippers it to be referred to as ms a is an infamous customer who is unbeknownst to me at the time notorious for picking out new employees and scamming them she has picked me out because she spent hours at a time in the store for around a week to see who is new who pays attention to what and who her best option is really if it wasnt pathetic id be impressed anyway the transaction goes underway and she being a veteran scumbag gets away with coupons off her total i am told this by the customer service clerkcsc who reviewed my till it was at that time i vowed to get her back and get her back good i decided to start plotting not because of to coupons but because of the absolute smug obnoxious glare she shot me when i handed her the receipt a look that says youre nothing but a cashier peasant you cant even complain about me you see im a vindictive sonofabitch and i really dont like getting taken advantage of as a preparation for my plan i took a picture of the coupons she used with my phone and stashed them back in the folder where they are kept fast forward months i am now a selfcheckout clerk much better at the job now the csc who first told me about ms a scamming me is a good friend of mine at this point another super doubles week is upon us and ms a sure enough makes another appearance same slippers same purse same hair i ask the csc if she can make a copy of the transaction ms a makes by using the customer service desk computer the csc agrees staying that its probably a good idea if she ever does get caught ms a knows not to try going through my line by now as i am experienced so she goes to a newer cashier to try to scam i go to the new cashiers station to help her bag i dont say anything about the coupons despite blatant scamming but i do snap a picture of the coupons and grab a copy of the receipt from the csc at the end of the shift to store away ms a came in more times that week and repeated the procedure i was able to collect evidence at of the instances fast forward months i am now a coarse wartorn veteran working as a csc dealing with the worst dregs that society can cough up at me i have now culminated about fraudlatent transactions that ms a has pushed through a register at this point my old csc friend is a comanager at this point and has been in on my plan for a while now and is actively trying to help me catch her during a slow day my friend calls me from the front desk to her office she says she has a plan to deal with ms a for good she will ask the security guard who watches selfcheckout when the tills are pulled at night to contact the police to be on standby during our upcoming super doubles week i didnt know that it was possible to request that police remain on standby but somehow my comanager friend did it fast forward month super doubles i prepare for a rough week of but i want this with this coupon theyre the same thing and why didnt this coupon that says do not double double then it happens ms a fumbles into the store i hear over my earpiece ms a is here novvacaine tell the security guard i do and sit back for the fireworks ms a blissfully unaware of the world of pain about to be lowered on her slowly scans the shelves for what she wants for over hours she goes to a very new cashier and proceeds to scam the hell out of the poor girl asking to void one item add another scan one coupon clear another item then add another item this is a very simple trick to confuse cashiers as to what theyve scanned and what they havent clarity for those wondering this is fraud and theft dont do it if you do choose to do it the employees will know your name face and spending habits and you just might end up with an asshole like me who is actively trying to get you arrested i make a copy of the registers actions up front as i always do with ms a but this time was different as soon as ms a swipes her card two police officers sidebyside walk up to ms a and ask her to step aside and speak for a moment ms a obviously distressed yells no leave me alone im doing nothing and tries to push past the officers the two officers are not in the business of dealing with her crap and quickly grab her and take her aside bunny slippers in tow her gucci purse still on the counter the purse precariously perched on the edge falls over unopened bottles of nyquill and a pack of lithium batteries roll out onto the desk i couldnt contain my laughter and i said aloud fucking score and then proceed to close off the cashiers lane and guide customers elsewhere ms a didnt return a police officer came and took the security tapes my copies of the months of transactions and took a picture of the attempted stolen goods nothing else was said about ms a fast forward to yesterday evening my comanager friend and i are at the front desk she is working in the front office in accounting and i am counting tills from the day she steps out from the office with a grin from ear to ear ms a just got convicted of theft and some drug charges long jail time from what i understand your transaction records pretty much sealed the case holy shit best day ever see i like to think i learned something about the nature of retail and the customer is always right its just a baiting game to see who is willing to step in shit enough times to eventually start smelling so bad they cant deny it anymore it may not always work but when it does sweet baby jesus its like christmas and when they do catch the people who are responsible like ms a quickly found out they find out that there are no coupons for bail edit tldr dont coupon scam its easy to catch edit formatting for readability
i work at a sandwich shop in socal one day i was working phone register which means i handled all the phone orders both taking and ringing them up as protocol states i take the order give them their number and tell them how long itll be until their order is finished pretty standard and easy one day an agitated guy comes in ag im picking up a phone order me okay sir what was your number ag she didnt give me a number me knowing i absolutely did give him a number i smile politely what name would it be under our system has caller id ag she didnt ask for my name she didnt give me a number she didnt do anything me okay sir can i have your telephone number to look up in our system ag this is ridiculous i just want my order it took everything in me not to say well if you had listened to me when i gave you your number this wouldnt be an issue but i didnt i just love my job
a few years ago i went into a large chain store a mart of if you will i dont recall what i was there to buy but it was nothing significant so i didnt grab a basket or shopping cart which ended up being a mistake as i walked through the isles i was flagged down by a women in a motor scooter who asked me to reach something on the top shelf thats normal right im a tall guy and shes immobilized i didnt even think of her asking as i handed her her item she asked me where the asprin was oh its actually in the next isle i responded once again thinking nothing of this women asking for help i walk away and make it about twenty feet before a second person approaches me to ask where the batteries were located i was puzzled as to why he had assumed i would know but i actually did know so i told him and went on my way a few minutes went by until i was yet again approached by someone who wanted to know where something was me hey can i ask you something why are you asking me where to find things person fuck you then ill find it myself at this point im puzzled i just want to get my items and leave you probably already know what happens next someone stops me and begins to ask a question before i interrupt listen im sorry i cant help you i just want to get my things and go the elderly gentlemen who i interrupted responded with oh did your shift end thats fine as he walked away my shift what did he mean my shift i didnt work there i couldnt even imagine why hed assume so im now nearly sprinting trying to finish my shopping before someone pulls me away again just as i think im in the clear i hear hey i turn around to me greeted by a portly man with an authoritative tone i assumed he was another customer until i noticed his badge which said his name and the word manager in bold hey uhhh clearly trying to place a name to my face you forgot your name tag and also can you get register six judy just took lunch to clarify this man did not glance at me and say this he was looking right at me right at my astonished face i responded with an open mouthed stare like i had just been lobotomized he evidently sensed my confusion as he repeated himself while grabbing my shirt and pointing at the checkout it wasnt until then that i noticed what i was wearing a blue polo and khakis the outfit of the employees at said store i wish i could tell you that i manned the register or otherwise took advantage of my active camo but i didnt i left the store as soon as possible with a half hour wasted and empty handed moral of the story the type of people that dont notice signs are the same people that dont notice the lack of a logo and name tag on my shirt the manager he was in a hurry and it was a big store an with a lot of employees my age maybe he thought i was in training or something

our store is near several group homes for people with mental disabilities or problems consequently we see every kind of behaviour one of our now regulars came in for the first time and had interesting requirements to make him happy he was very averse to being touched so i had to lay his change out on the counter for him to pick up fine ive had people ask that before but this was something new twitchy customer okay okay okay now gimme my change but here thumps counter me okay you have two dollars sixteen cents i begin to lay the money on the counter remembering another customer who is very ocd and has to have her money aligned properly twitchy customer no stop one at a time me oookay heres one dollar heres two dollars twitchy customer no you have to acknowledge it me what twitchy customer acknowledge it acknowledge my money i had no idea what he meant so i waved my hand over the money on the counter and said solemnly i acknowledge thee twitchy customer thank you i did that for ever coin i laid down hed nod and thank me to this day he comes in and is very pleasant as long as you acknowledge his money update wow thank you for all the comments and upvotes people this is only the second time ive posted so its nice may i even say i feel acknowledged 
i work in a relatively popular department store with an extremely lenient returns policy my main area is in the home store but i pick up shifts in clothing as well so i was working in the plus size department one night and a lady comes up with a bag of burts bees sp cosmetics and i had no idea we even sold these she tells me her grandmother she was way too old for that though lmao is a compulsive impulsive shopper who bought all of the burts bees online and that she was coming to return them for her i normally dont take back anything but clothes and occasionally home items in a clothing department but she had waited in line a long time for me so i was going to take it after all she couldve been completely legitimate i have had people doing the same thing albeit with clothes and they had literally every form of proof of purchase receipts her card everything so i open up the return window and i ask her if she has a receipt mind you she didnt bring them in typical packaging this was just a regular mesh kind of bag not even a shopping bag she says no okay no big deal theres like ways to return something so i ask if she had her grandmothers card that she purchased the items on she then says no she paid with cash oh yeah with cash on an online order yeah i sent her to cosmetics i wasnt dealing with her edit oh the upvotes this is my most up voted post thanks guys

i work in a supermarket in the uk on the deli counter serving cold meats cheese olives what have you and quite often in the quiet times of the day therell be just one of us serving whilst others are on lunch or counting stock this was one of those occasions sometimes when there are a few customers waiting at different parts of the counter its hard to know who was first but i trust my judgement just after i finished serving someone some gammon i walked up to a gentleman at the end to serve him when i suddenly hear excuse me in the rudest tone i ask her what she wanted and she demanded that she was next i said im sorry but im pretty sure this gentleman was next and she demanded i serve her the man was very understanding and told me i was fine to serve her she was after some beef so i sliced it for her and she went on her way i went back to the man and apologised profusely for what happened whilst serving his cheese he then looked at me and with the straightest face and responded its okay i hope she chokes on her beef and then he walked away cue me and the customers who had witnessed this bursting into hysterics this man is a legend thinking about it though i havent seen her in store since it happened tldr woman pushed in line man may have cursed her by hoping she chokes on her beef havent seen woman since presumably the beef got her 
so in this tale im a customer i dont have a drivers license long story but kids pay your speeding tickets on time i do have a state issued id in its place the exact same requirements to get a state id are the ones you have to get a drivers license and theyre supposed to be accepted as a form of id for any purpose ive had my state id for years and have never had an issue with it until today i was in the grocery store i commonly frequent buying todays dinner supplies and some beer when the cashier got to the beer they asked for id im so i still get carded about the time and i hand over my state id they stare at it like theyd never seen one before cashier um do you have a drivers license me no i have this state id its the same thing they call a manager over who barely glances at the id before informing me that it was against the law for them to use it for liquor purchasing purposes heres the deal im a bartender i know what the liquor laws say about ids you can accept for buying booze i have a big poster behind my bar showing the appropriate ids and state ids are acceptable to buy booze i inform the manager of this and they literally just turn their back and walk away from me while im in mid sentence so im pretty steaming now and after i finish my purchase minus the beer i go to the customer service desk and ask to speak to another manager of course the original one i spoke to is the only one there so i leave go home and write an email to their corporate office explaining what happened if its their store policy fine though thats a weird fucking policy dont lie and tell me its the law when i know exactly what the law says im more than happy to take the a month i spend on groceries to a competitor who will treat me respectfully and sell me my sweet sweet booze

there are many things our techs find in tires when doing a tire repair at our store this is probably the strangest thing they have ever seen come into the shop a woman pulled up and requested us to look at her tire because it was making alot of noise after she ran something over in the road well we write up a work order and she heads into the waiting area while we get to work simple tire order nothing unusual we see these all the time well we put the tire on the lift and as we move it in we see the offending object looked like a piece of metal and it was still lodged in the tire we lift up the car and rotate the tire to a better angle to look at it because we need to know what were dealing with one of the techs who is working on it hollers holy crap i aint touching this the supervisor assumed that the tech was saying there was a mechanical issue with the vehicle so he came over to look and started laughing like a mad man well i go over to get a better look at whats causing this commotion turns out there is a metal dildo in this womans tire we all in the shop are laughing real hard over this and we have to get this thing out of the tire to assess the damage well we ended up using a pair of pliers to get this offending toy out of the tire well in the long run unfortunately were not able to do a repair as the punctured area was not able to be fixxed well we have to notify this woman she needs a new tire and we have to show her the reason we tell our supervisor he has to give her the bad news and show her the reason it needs repaired he calls the woman out to the shop area to speak to her in private because he did not want to just go inside in front of other customers and blurt out i am sorry maam but a dildo penetrated your tire in an area so badly it cannot be repaired well apparently he did not tell her what it was because i can hear her say well what the hell punctured my tire well he brings her to the edge of the shop and he grabs a pair of nitrile gloves and grabs the pliers to grab the toy to show her the woman upon seeing this mangled item begins to convulse in laughter the supervisor was mortified showing this to her and was red as a lobster needless to say the woman purchased a new tire and we all had a good laugh over this ordeal edit the dildo was crushed a bit on the back end of it that is how it got the tire for those who were wondering it was not a solid piece of metal the rest of it was messed up a bit i assume from being caught in the tire and somehow not getting thrown off by a rapidly rotating wire as for location there is a nearby airport and there are a few areas nearby that are big draws for vacationers so where this came from no clue and dont wanna know 
background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax with the th of july and new years eve warmup welcome to the week of scam artists they rarely get away with it but that sure doesnt stop them from trying and occasionally winning you know its going to be a long day when the guy wearing the dark suit and standing in front of you pulls out his secret service identification most of the people who buy fireworks from me use credit cards im actually pretty happy about that even though i have to pay fees on each transaction it reduces the possibility of theft and i dont have to deal with as much cash believe it or not most banks now charge you a fee if you deposit more than in cash to your account during a single billing period yep its bullshit but if all banks are doing it whats your alternative that being said we still receive a fair amount of cash during the course of our sales season and i do everything i can to reduce my risk my cashiers all use money pens to check the large bills we try not to keep a lot of cash in the register drawers and our friendly local police escort me to do cash drops at the bank when needed overall weve had very few problems story one of my cashiers called me over because the bill she was holding didnt look right the paper seemed right and it passed the pen test but the printing on the bill did seem a little off the lady who had paid with the bill was getting impatient and in the end i just assumed the bill was old and worn we do see that a lot apparently the night deposit i made on the th of july had several of the bills to be exact guess who showed up at my tent on july th to discuss it the agents were actually very nice they couldnt give me many details but apparently the woman who had passed the bill was no stranger to them im not sure if she had made multiple purchases at my store each with a phony bill or if she had accomplices i gave them my statement but i honestly didnt have much to tell them the agents did say that the bills were actually very high quality and that we were lucky to have noticed anything wrong i didnt feel very lucky in the end i was scammed out of to the lady who scammed me i have a container of explosives and a very particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career skills that make me a nightmare for people like you if i see you in my shop again if youre interested ive posted a few other stories and a scary til about where some of these fakes come from
so i work in the dairy aisle in a supermarket its a good job usually and like any supermarket job there are people that will come up and ask if you have a product in this case we would tell them where it is and then just continue with our day but sometimes people know where a product is and they just want to be a dick to the the staff which im sure you all know about case in point idiotman walks up to me asking about bread now for this to make sense you need to understand a few things the supermarket i work at is a regular suburban supermarket near a small arcade area now in this arcade area there are a couple of shops a hairdressers a patisserie and a bakery if you want to go to the bakery you have to walk out of the store and then work literally ten meters to your left where the bakery is anyway idiotman walks up to me and says hey you come hear in that rude voice which means something has happened to him that is inexplicably my fault i walk over to him and he is pointing at the shelved area where all the new bread rolls we get everyday are kept idiotman is giving me dagger eyes and he starts shouting whilst pointing at an empty shelf of cent rolls i come here everyday and youre always out of these fucking rolls along with other complaints including how he works such a hard schedule and he deserves a roll which fate has somehow unfairly cheated him out of now i am a bit flabbergasted at this man there is nothing i can do to get him more bread rolls because they are only delivered once a day but more importantly there is a bakery right next door where he could probably get a cheaper and tastier bread roll my go to response is the usual sir im sorry i cant help you but i can get you the manager if you would like but alas idiotman is a veteran in the field of being a dick to staff and obviously understands that if someone with authority tells him leave there is not much he can do about it he tells me that i have to deal with the situation for some ungodly reason but i dont want to be rude plus it is apparently my moral duty now to ensure this man gets his bread so i say politely sir there is not a lot i can do about the situation have you considered going to the bakery next door unfortunately for me idiot man is offended by common sense and so now he wants me to get the manager so he can tell him how inappropriate it is to tell a customer to shop elsewhere which according to idiotman is what i was doing so i go get my manager who is awesome and tell him that some man wants a bread roll which we are out of and is angry because i told him to go to the bakery my manager comes back to the man with me and asks what the problem is idiotman tells my manager you are out of these fucking bread rolls and your staff member has been very rude to me my genius boss looks at him wide eyed and out of nowhere sprints to the front of the store idiotman and i follow and as we reach the entrance we see my manager standing in the doorway looking at the bakery for about a minute he stands in the doorway staring at the bakery and then looking back at the man back and forth and back and forth with utter confusion on his face eventually he turns to idiotman and asks sir you know there is a bakery right next door right i only kept it together long enough for the man to drop his basket and storm angrily out before losing my shit edit thanks everyone im definitely going to show all your comments to my boss next time im at work
i was checking through a woman who was frantic about getting a off discount we do have coupons but the only ones that are valid this months are ones where you have to donate used items to a charity we partner with to get them she physically jumps in front of her husband to stop him from putting items on my till gtcustomer is there off today gtme sorry theres no sales today if you have a coupon for donating i can take that she rummages through her purse the husband starts putting up items and she grabs every second or third one holding it up to me she proclaims the price and asks gtcustomer is this on sale gtme no there are no discounts today gtcustomer is it off she points to various promotional signs that hang around and i again explain that those do not indicate a sale they pertain to things like seniors day and the charity we partner with a line up as formed behind her as she searches for a coupon we all know very well she does not have she couldnt be over and she asks gtcustomer well do you have a seniors day discount my internal reaction is annoyance lady stop asking me for discounts after ive specifically answered multiple times that unless you have a valid coupon you are not getting a discount i of course didnt say anything but the line forming behind her did they decided to errupt in laughter at this young woman asking for a seniors discount its so funny to them she gets the encouragement to keep repeating the question to me 
as ive posted before i work at a board game store in a mall we have a metal stand that goes in the hallway that holds our adverts which are kind of flimsy the metal stand doesnt sit evenly on the floor meaning it rattles when you bump it this teenage girl was standing on it and rocking it back and forth meaning it was making a loud noise she was also damaging the actual sign as well as the metal stand so i walked over and asked her to please stop i was going to ignore the damage since the thing was kind of rickety in the first place her mother went off on me and told me that she was the mom and i wasnt and to stop trying to control her daughter so i asked her if she wanted to pay for a replacement about for the actual stand and for the board as both were now beaten pretty badly she asked to see the manager she was pretty upset when i told her i am the manager i didnt actually make her pay for it i just wanted her to stop bitching at me 
back when i worked at a renowned coffee shop in the us i wound up with a lot of really interesting stories to share but the one that comes to mind is when some guy came through our drivethru and ordered a mocha now this wasnt any old mocha no he needed some extra sugar i dont judge so he said to me over my headset can i get like a shitton of chocolate in that he started laughing no doubt at the fact he used foul language during the customeremployee interaction a social taboo i do believe without missing a beat i respond in perfect deadpan voice sir im going to murder that motherfucker with chocolate my entire shift turns to me and looks like id just read a page off of the necronomicon all while the guy at the ordering box is bursting with uproarious laughter my managers give me a verbal warning but it was pretty clear that id made the guys day so they didnt take any real action against me afterwords however whenever i worked the espresso bar they would tell me hey can you go murder some drinks while person is on lunch tldr i am the drinkmurderer
last summer i worked as a cashier at target easy job dealt all walks of life and a pretty typical summer job one customer really left an impact on me though in a way i would have never expected a pack of skittles lip balm and a soft drink was all he was purchasing when i looked up to see the man behind the selections a tall stocky figure with a legendary mustache and a chipped front tooth greeted me the bundle of facial hair was extremely thick brown with spots of gray and obviously something he took an enormous deal of pride in my first instinct as it usually is with anybody who has exceptional facial hair was to compliment the man on his work of art he replied by thanking me and explaining how he hadnt shaved it since when i asked why he responds back in vietnam my best friend told me if you ever die im never shaving this here mustache we were always competing against each other so i told him alright motherfucker you got a deal three days later i saw him get shot in the head and this has been untouched ever since i was completely taken back obviously and after a few seconds told him that was very honorable to which he replied no thats war took his change and left never for me to see him again biggest badass ever
i was working cash and things were going normal totally fine it had been a great day the store was starting to slow down and there were only two people left in my line awesome i finish bagging this older gentlemanslike late s s groceries and he pays gtme im just gonna put your receipt in your bag alright no one ever says no to this so i start to put it in someone grabs my hand to stop me gtoldergent hey dont you know those things cause cancer gtme uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhnooo gtoldergent well they do you should probably wash your hands after handling them gtme uhhhhhhhhhokay will do the customer behind the older gentleman and i exchanged glances as he left he didnt take his receipt
yesterday i was running a till and it was extremely busy customer comes through my till with her groceries long line behind her i scan them and get to the end me your total is xxxx customer hands me a card me is that a debit or credit card customer looks at me like im stupid and says credit its a visa card me okay credit it is i then tap her card and hand her back her card and her receipt customer oh i should get cash back on the order so i can have some cash she stands there looking at me me your order is finished ive processed it on the card you gave me and i handed you the receipt customer how did you do that oh right the tap this is ridiculous i wanted cash back you should have told me you were going to tap my card me just take your receipt and card to the service desk they can refund your order on your visa and then process it on debit for you to get cash back customer i cant believe this this is so stupid this is your fault customer walks away in a huff to the service desk yeah its my fault what was i thinking processing your order on the card that you gave me
this is a bit of a success story rolled in with one of the most infuriating experiences ive had in retail its long so bear with me a little background i am very timid and a bit of a pushover in certain situations if possible i avoid situations rising to confrontation but can generally remain calm during stressful situations if i need to be im working at the service desk on a relatively easy night at the store where i work another woman who had been covering the desk with me is on her break leaving me by myself not that big of a deal up rolls this something woman in an electric cart and i feel it in my bones this is not going to be easy she puts a clearance jacket on the counter i ask if shes purchasing the jacket since its the service desk the main focus is of course handling returns and exchanges she looks at me like im the least intelligent person she has ever encountered in her life clwhat else would i be doing with it me generally this desk is used for returns and exchanges but if youre purchasing i can absolutely do that for you i ring up the coat and tell her her total she goes to hand me a card but i point to the card reader telling her to run it through the side cl i cant its a gift card me since its a visa gift card and not a store gift card you run it through the machine she swipes the card me do you have a pin set up by this point im being perfectly pleasant and trying to help her through the process as best as possible knowing it can often be confusing for older people cl i just told you this is a gift card you cant have a pin for these things me you can actually call the company and have a pin set up so you can run it as a de cl no you cant theres no pin me okay and we all know this okay its the okay crazy bitch that youre not allowed to actually say out loud so you stop at okay me press the red x then press credit on the next screen youll need to sign for it she does as i tell her and when she finishes my register tells me that she still owes a little more than three dollars after the remaining balance from the gift card was applied i inform her of this and she proceeds to pull out two off with our apologies coupons that we give to people who experience inconveniences at the fault of our store me oh those are actually coupons which need to be applied before the payment so in order to use those i would have to void out the card payment and cl you cant do that the money wont go back on the card right away and i wont be able to use it youre stealing my money now i know some people use caps and exclamation points in a bit of a hyperbole to make the situation seem more extreme than it really is however my supervisor nh for not helping was standing easily thirty yards away from the desk with two sets of shelves in between us and the very second cl started yelling nhs head pops up above the shelves while she gives me a the fk is going on look i try to very calmly despite already starting to get shaky at the thought of the oncoming hellfire about to rain down on me explain to her why things wont work the way that she wants to and that no i cant make the register work the exact way you want it to work nh comes over to try and defuse the situation but she has terrible confrontationhandling skills and only manages to make cl even more upset cue other customers actually stopping to gawk and our smallbutfierce sbf security girl coming over to interject sbf maam if you could please just cl no nobody asked you to enter this conversation so im not even talking to you this cashier stole my money and is trying to screw me over this mistake needs to be fixed right now nh calls our store manager up to the service desk at this point the situation has been going on for at least minutes sbf is standing behind me legitimately concerned that she will dive over the desk and throttle this woman if given a direct path as the other service desk employee has yet to come back from her meal break we couldnt help any other customers during the entirety of the exchange our normally calm and collected cac store manager comes over i start to explain the situation but cl cuts me off yelling to the store manager that i stole her money i am literally shaking cac approves for us to void the payment and use the coupons to bring the price down to what can be covered by the balance on the card he then walks away i do as he says we apply the coupons and try to run the card of course it is decline cl this is exactly what i told you would happen i told you not to do that me through gritted teeth i am only doing what my supervisor instructed me to do this is how coupons work maam and this is how they work just about everywhere coupons as ive already told you need to be applied before we accept any payment she flips her shit nh over walkietalkie cac back to the service desk sbf dipity take a step back cac comes back me the card got declined but cl this idiot just stole my money cac hey this is a mile an hour zone and youre cruising at about so im going to need you to ease off the accelerator and at this moment everything stops no one has ever heard cac raise his voice before he just said what cl sounding legitimately shocked and insulted why would you speak to me like that cac there is not a person here with ears who appreciates your tone these are human beings you are speaking at cl this girl stole my money i cant use it now cac i will personally had you twenty dollars out of this register to leave this store and never come back and hopefully never go to any other storeiworkat with this kind of attitude ever again somewhere in the middle of the yelling the other service desk employee has come back and slowly figures out what is going on she calls the card company and the automated number tells her that the remaining balance is still the whatever that cl thinks is missing from her card cl is now offended every way from sunday but set on buying this jacket but im never shopping here again we manage to get the transaction to go through i hand her the receipt with no hint of civility in the interaction then oh dear goodness then cl gets pleasant cl hon i think i might have gotten the wrong one could you tell me what size it is please me no cl excuse me i asked you for help me and i am refusing you dont talk to me ever again sbf nh i think dipity might need an extra five minute break me dipity does need an extra five minute break which she will be taking outside and she will remain outside until all crazy people have left the service desk i ripped the service desk keys off my belt and the walkie head set out of my ear only barely refraining from throwing them down cac dipity also probably needs a free drink from coffeeshopinsidestore ill go over with you and get you one crazy lady tries to argue with the people remaining at the desk but everyone ignores her she then proceeded to go back into the store to do more shopping despite having just promised us to never shop there again tldr lady goes batsht crazy because she doesnt know how coupons work and manager defuses situation with the gem in the title
okay this is a long complicated story i figured you guys would understand it the best because most of you work with debitcredit card payment terminals any who i work in a high end optical store we have frames that sell for over so naturally we attract a scum or two the other day a young guy came in early s looking to buy a gift for his girlfriend okay no problem i let my coworker tend to him while i went on my lowly inventory duties a few minutes later and hes asking to try on some very expensive cartier frames for himself usually this doesnt even catch my attention but the guy was just acting off a few minutes pass and surprise surprise the guy decides he wants to buy them great my coworker processes the sale hands him the payment terminal so he can insert his card chip first into the machine to use his credit card canada i notice the guy is pressing a few too many buttons way more than a digit pin should be just to be safe i casually pretend to put something away behind him and look at the machine this fucker is on the swipe or type in your credit card number screen and typing in someone elses credit card number he feigned putting in his card so that he could enter in a stolen credit card number to put the sale under i came up from behind and grabbed the machine from his hands i told him he needs to use a real card or get out now he acts all confused whwhwhat are you talking about i asked to see the card in his hand to match the number with the card number he was trying to put into the machine he suddenly lost all ability to speak and just kept asking what my problem was i told him i knew what he was doing and he needs to pay with a real card or get out he would not give up he tried getting in my face im a short youngish girl so im not very intimidating so i offered to call the cops and have them handle it instead i have never seen somebody high tail it out of there so fast in my life so yeah if any of you work in high end stores keep a look out for this trick apparantly another one of our stores had this happen to them but they didnt catch it until after they got a call a few days later telling them the card was stolen from a different province oh and how does my workplace repay me our store is getting paid a few days late due to an accounting problem from another store why do i even bother edit wow this blew up over night so happy this is my first big post p
back when i was a trainer at a canadian grocery chain i had this horrifying experience beware if you have a helicopter mom this might give you flashbacks we usually grouped ability levels together to make my job easier that weekend had been a group of five high school girls they were told to meet me at customer service and we would head to the boardroom four of my girls had arrived and i patiently waited for the fifth a girl named tina two minutes before the training time started i saw her but she wasnt alone she was with her mom well thats okay maybe its her first job my dad had snapped a photo of me at my first day at my first job so i just ignored it i introduced myself to the girls and went over how they were gonna split the next hours one day training one hour practice shift then one hour real shift i told them id be there the entire time and blah blah blah basically gave my im your number one right now spiel i motioned for them to follow me to our boardroom the mom got up too she followed us all the way to the back doors when i saw she hadnt left i looked at tina who did not even make eye contact so i guess i had to be the one to speak excuse me ms tinas mom were heading into our training now if we finish early tina can use our phones to call but we should be done at tinas mom oh thats okay ill just come on back with yall what um no me unfortunately i cannot do that as the training session contains fairly confidential information but we will be done at six and theres plenty to do in this plaza if you dont wanna go home yet the mom looked slightly miffed but she acquiesced and turned away i glanced at tina again still no eye contact and then pushed open the doors after six when i was in the office signing training forms my coworker popped in cw hey you know that lady who came in with your trainee the blonde one me yeah she wanted to come into our training session cw yeah she complained to sam our manager that you wouldnt let her and then she sat on the bench until six me me she sat there for eight hours cw she had an ipad but yeah just sat there until your trainees were free wtf i tried to rationalize it maybe she was worried tina would get sick or something and she needed to be there hopefully she wouldnt be back tomorrow except she was as i stood at a till with my trainees demonstrating the ins and outs of the register she stood at the bagging area and stared i decided to ignore her and began my usual technique of onthego teaching i pretend to be a customer and they have to hit all the points before i put the next girl on tina was my first because she drew the short straw holy crap for every mistake tina made her mom was criticizing her before i corrected it i dont know if her mom stole the manual or something but it was driving me nuts and with each mistake that she got yelled at for she got more flustered and more prone to mistakes after a particularly derogatory comment about tinas intellectual capacity i almost lost it me excuse me i am the trainer here i know tina is your daughter but she is currently my employee i need to ask you to leave as youre interfering with all my trainees tinas mom thats ridiculous i should be allowed to be involved me well we hired tina not you so for as long as shes on the clock your involvement is not welcome the mom stared at me beady eyes and then left to the bench she had sat on yesterday she stared at me the entire time but whatever better than being a colossal pain in my ass tina improved greatly without her mothers constant judgement i was excited to see how my girls would fare the next day a sunday sundays were good training days because you either sink or swim but my training was so good that all of my employees swam tina seemed pretty shy so hopefully this would be a good experience for her except and you probably guessed it tina did not show up on sunday i called her house a few times throughout the week but she had no answer after her training paycheck went through hr closed her employee file and i felt pretty bad for her how was she gonna do anything with a mom like that 
like many of you brave souls i once worked retail at one of the largest video game stores in the united states in fact it was a glorious time just before the advent of corporates fixation on reservations and subscriptions but during the heady days of the newly launched xbox and ps systems flew of the shelves jack thompson was the source of many a knowing chuckle and i truly enjoyed going into work each and every day now because jack thompson was still a thing at that time we had all been briefed over and over again that we could not sell rated m games to minors and had to in every single case get the purchasers id if the minor wanted the game we had to get their parent to approve no parent no sale cue the year old gangster kid he waltzed into the store all dressed up trying to look as intimidating as a short chubby preteen with ego issues could i kept an eye on him asked him if he needed help and went about my business after about ten minutes he came up to the front desk with gta san andreas he slammed it down on the front desk and announced im getting this cheerful delighted me replied of course can i see your id blank stare what i helpfully flipped the game case over to the esrb rating im sorry but since this is a rated m for mature game im not able to sell it without your id or your mother or fathers permission his eyes lit up little did i know id given him the perfect out with a hurried one sec he ran out of the store to fetch the parental unit the parental unit in this case turned out to be his mother or possibly grandmother who clearly spoke little to no english as her frustrated chatter to her son revealed as she entered the store what do you need she grumbled at him as they came to the desk the lady needs your id just show her your license and say ok her son told her as quickly as he could its nothing theyre just stupid now you might have noticed i put that dialogue in italics thats because it was conducted entirely in spanish and because thanks to my public school education i knew spanish not well enough to write an essay but definitely well enough to follow the conversation and know the son was trying to pull a fast one on mom time for due diligence maam im sorry to bother you but your son wishes to purchase this mature game i told her her eyes widened ed note i am the whitest white chick that ever walked the earth im so white my ancestors came over on the mayflower ok fine she replied let me get it she started to rummage about in her purse while her son glared daggers at me theres a little more to it i told her i pointed deliberately to the m rating this game has blood violence people having sex naked people drugs and other assorted mature topics i want to make sure you understand this before i sell him the game her eyes got wider and wider with each strike against the game as her son wilted more and more when i finished she whipped around grabbed her son by the ear and marched him out of the store flinging invectives and curses at him for trying to trick her into letting him get the game i chuckled put the game away and lay in wait for the next troublemaker to enter the store
i work rd shift at a particularly large employer of many many people one fateful night as i was attending my putting things on shelves duties some teenaged kids came in and apparently started hiding some high dollar merchandise in the sporting good area no one noticed this later around am the wind down of my night these kids came back with shopping carts running to where they hid all these items that they apparently absolutely could not live without they grabbed all the stuff up and started booking for the door the manager on duty however was having no theft on his watchmind you this mountain of a mans nickname is the punisher he immediately chases after them and yells to the cashier on duty to call the fuckin cops as he gets to the parking lot theyre speeding off in their getaway sedona but do you think that stopped the punisher no as theyre speeding off to retire in style after their successful heist my salaried manager proceeds to throw a damn shopping cart at their car busting out their window when he got on the phone with the cops he merely said yeah theyre in the white sedona with no rear window tldr manager throws shopping cart at thieves no repercussions on his part
background im a teenager working at a small clothing store in canada about minutes away from the american border so we occasionally get a few customers from the states normally i work cash so of course i get to deal with any of the confused customers over their purchases the most common problem that arises is that people shopping here who come from the states are sometimes unaware or forget that canada doesnt use pennies anymore theyre just gone from our currency system instead we round to the nearest or so and round down to zero while and round up to pretty straightforward our register will ring up the exact total and it is up to the cashier to figure out the rounding system to give out the change i usually explain this to anyone confused as to why they didnt receive a penny and for the most part im met with calm understanding calm and understanding did not fit the personality of penny lady however at the time i was ringing her up pls credit card had just gotten bounced so she grumbled a little bit and pulled out some cash to pay for her purchase keep in mind my store sells pretty pricey clothing minimum for a shirt so her purchase was about for items she pays the full amount in cash bill bill and loonie and i print out her receipt and wish her a good day like the obedient drone i am this is where it gets ugly the lady comes back ten minutes later when its thankfully quiet and marches up to me at the cash gt pl ahem gt me hi there happy retail smile is there something i can help you with gt pl i did not recieve the proper amount of change gt me oh my apologies miss may i see your receipt to confirm gt pl hands me the receipt i expected better of this store i shop here all the time and i have never been dishonoured like this before gt me im very sorry miss ill try and fix this as fast as possible how much change were you due gt pl i was supposed to receive some change but i got none look at the receipt glancing down at the receipt i check to see how much change she was due from her purchase it says change due which means i have to round down to no change this lady essentially paid the full price in cash and was demanding a penny in change which i cant do gt me ah i see the error here im very sorry miss shows the change due area on the receipt you see we dont use pennies anymore here i explain the penny system to her gt pl well im going back to the states tonight and i want some exact change back so the border security doesnt pull me over gt me miss i dont travel much but i dont think youll get called at the border over a penny they are aware of the rule im afraid theres nothing i can do for you gt pl i dont need your sass child get me your manager im still smiling the happy retail smile as i go off to get my manager thinking oh you bitch its just a penny luckily my cool manager cm has my back and he walks over and explains the same thing to the very flustered lady she is still demanding her penny so he finally cracks he walked into the back of the store found a penny lying on the ground covered in dust its been there forages but no one wants it for obvious reasons and walked back out gt cm handing the lady the penny here you are now please understand that we will not be giving out any more pennies thank you the lady harrumphs and finally leaves the store then cm highfives me for handling the situation well to this day i get slightly irritated whenever i have to explain the rule though
edit i meant know the store its am ok so this just happened a few days ago nothing big just a slightly annoying occurrence as a customer another thing worth knowing is that this specific store has a dress code of a dark blue shirt with their logo and black pants i was wearing a colorful and loud summer dress so i was browsing an arts and crafts store chain art book addict i like looking at the things i cant draw when i saw a female worker seeming to be lost i honestly thought she was new since anyone who isnt at the store regularly can get extremely lost so i asked if she was looking for something gtworker do you have any idea where the faux plants are for schooltype projects gtme the mossy things yeah over in aisle next to the paints theres a giant orange sign above it kind of hidden by the starter kits gtworker handing me a giant box of the mossstuff great go put this over there after several painfully long seconds of me standing there awkwardly she gives me the dirtiest glare ever well go put it away gtme i dont work here glanced at her badge she was a manager wtf gtworker oh well go do it anyway gtis this real life me what gtworker looking at me as if i was a fucking idiot go put it away gtme i just dropped the box and left fuck that lady second edit she doesnt work there anymore she works at another store now i have complained about her in that one but they still keep her 
heres another story from the gas station this happened at the end of last winter a customer calls us on our phone which is pretty unusual normally the only calls we get are from other gas stations within our chain without warning she says gtcustomer have you received any complaints about your gas being watered down gtme no we havent gtcustomer well let me be the first oh boy here we go she explains that she filled her car and lawnmower with our gas after which the lawnmower wouldnt start she admits her car works fine however she says she took her lawnmower into a repair place and they said the gas was watered down great im thinking yeah probably because you let your lawnmower sit all winter and water accumulated over time the more likely scenario isnt a conspiracy where we water our gas down and your lawnmower is the only machine in town sensitive enough to detect it whatever i give her my managers name take her phone number and tell her my manager will call her when she comes into work tomorrow after hanging up the phone i joke with a customer who partially overheard the conversation gtwoman always a complaint call huh gtme actually no i mean were a gas station who calls a gas station to complain gtwoman haha some people are crazy i thought that was the end of it for me but it wasnt a couple days later i ask my manager if she ever called lawnmower lady she says she did but lawnmower lady didnt answer later im told by a coworker that lawnmower lady came to the store on his shift the previous night she wanted to speak with the manager my coworker informed her my manager only works mornings the next day lawnmower lady shows up on my shift asking the same thing as well as telling me about her lawnmower again i text my manager you need to talk to this woman shes gonna keep bothering us until she speaks with you my manager tells me to email lawnmower ladys info to the store director and have the store director deal with her a few days later she comes in on my shift again weve told her multiple times my manager only works mornings so i dont know why she thought shed be here this time predicably no one has called her i finally tell her gtlook we dont water down our gas we conform to all fuel regulations i kinda pulled fuel regulations out of my ass im sure thats probably a thing but i dont really know im just a clerk tired of being the middleman between her and the higherups who dont want to deal with her gtis it possible that water accumulated in your lawnmowers gas tank from sitting unmaintained all winter thats a thing too right gtcustomer oh no thats not possible the repair shop said the gas was watered down gtme im sorry ill email the store director again and have him call you apparently the store director passed her over to our corporate office and had them call her mercifully that was finally the end of it i kinda wish i knew what they told her to get her to stop tldr woman on a crusade slanders our gas station higherups force me to deal with her because they dont want to she finally stops after getting the phone call she wanted
working at a movie theatre concession stand i once had a customer demand my manager before anything had happened while the manager leaned over my shoulder she began ranting about how rude it was that the girl who sold her tickets didnt even stand up to greet her before the manager had a chance to react i replied shes in a fucking wheelchair maam edit apparently i need to clarify so peoples underwear remain in an unbunched state i said this because i was shocked not because im trying to sound like some sort of badass just because shes a cripple doesnt mean she needs to be so fucking rude 
long time lurker here first time posting finally had something happen that i thought was worthy so i work for a large international coffee chain that is very lenient in customer service in terms of giving whatever the customer wants to a degree of course so i just started my lunch break on an extremely slow day when a lady comes in im about to order a drink for my break when i hear the following interaction with my coworker gtlady this is the worst cup of coffee i have ever tasted gtcoworker oh im so sorry about that let me get you a new one proceeds to dispense coffee from same container gtlady this tastes much better but is still crap she then somehow manages to spill a little on her shirt gtlady i spilled this coffee on my shirt this is your fault the cups and sleeves you guys use are awful competitor x has much better cups at this point my coworker is a little flustered and as the supervisor i decide to jump in gtme hi maam im so sorry to hear that our coffee isnt to your standard i see that we are almost done brewing a fresh batch let me get you a new one and double cup it for you gtlady i dont care your cups are still crap unlike competitor x gtme actually maam we use the same company as competitor x for our cups and sleeves and theres nothing i can do about that but feel free to send an email to corporate they actually do listen here is your new cup of coffee straight from the brewer black as you requested i hope you are satisfied with this one she begrudgingly takes the cup of coffee walks over to the condiment stand pours out half of it into the garbage puts a ton of sugar and fills half the cup with milk she comes back to the cash register and i realize that i will never get to go on my break gtlady this coffee isnt even hot can you microwave it gtme maam that coffee was straight from the brewer to your cup i cannot make it any hotter than that we do not have a microwave and i do not recommend microwaving your coffee as it will compromise the taste and these cups are nonmicrowaveable gtlady but i put cold milk in it it makes it room temperature gtme maam i cannot do anything about cold milk making your coffee colder if youd like you can get steamed milk with your coffee for cents extra but i cannot do anything else otherwise normally i would just give them the upgrade for free but screw this woman gtlady stares at me like ive said the most ridiculous thing in the world you expect me to pay cents for that this is ridiculous i go to competitor x all the time and dont have this problem gtme maam i dont want you to walk away unhappy with a cup of coffee you are not satisfied with but there is really nothing i can do here is your money back if you feel that competitor x can meet your standards then i honestly encourage you to go there since this is something i cannot fix i would not feel comfortable serving people lukewarm milk with their coffee gtlady fine ill take my money back can i get a cup of hot water i take the coffee back which shocks her clearly she wanted attention and a free coffee give her the hot water she proceeds to sit at the only handicap accessible table we have leaves an hour later with her cup of hot water untouched bonus note she apparently has gone to another nearby location before and complained that her cup caught fire when she tried to microwave it at home ps someone told her it was not microwaveable and it is also clearly marked edited for formattinggrammar

hello tfr been wanting to post a story here for a while but i couldnt decide on one this one comes to you from years ago our tale starts in a big blue box department store in a small town i was fresh out of high school and working there back when they actually gave full time jobs i was a jack of all trades pretty much cashier stock service desk cart pusher on this day i was outside pushing carts it seemed like any other day and pretty soon it was lunch time i head back to the break room and grab my lunch i would later wish id headed out to eat that day luckily i had time to finish eating and by now am just relaxing and chatting with coworkers the phone in the break room rings and someone answers it they holler at me and tell me i have a call the person on the other end is a girl from the service desk telling me an officer wanted to speak with me what really i crack up laughing ive never had a problem with the lawis this a prank next thing i know i hear this loud male voice in my ear sir this is officer im a prick and i know it and i need you up front now well drat wtf is going on so i trudge the long way through the huge store back up front and find the officer he proceeds to ask me if i saw a purse while i was outside cart pushing nope sure didnt officer he of course doesnt believe me well a lady lost her purse and says she saw you outside pushing carts at the time thats great officer she probably saw me as i was heading back in for lunch so i wouldnt have wound up pushing her cart did you drive to work he asks me yup sure did so he has me show him to my car asks if he can look inside ive got nothing to hide so i let him he opens all the car doors pops the hood and the trunk looking for this ladies purse during the process of searching my car he found a check my grandma wrote to my girlfriend for her birthday and took it he also found an old id that a friend had left in my car that i never knew was there and gave me hell for having some elses id quizzed me heavily about the check told him it was a check from my grandmother to my girlfriend and she rode into work with me so she left it in the car oh shes here too sowe go walking back into the store where he has me point her out so he can give her the check back she glares at him and hands it right back to me he then grabs it from my hand and gives it back to her and tells her not to give it to me again she gives him the evil eye and says hes the one with the bank account hes going to be cashing it for me and as soon as you leave he is going to be the one holding it again with that she walked away the cop looked pretty mad he starts quizzing me if i have a locker in the back nope i dont they only give lockers to girls then he tries to coerce a confession out of me not happening bud i didnt do shit finally he leaves at this point its been over hours hed kept me from working and i was still off the clock from lunch i went and raised hell with the managers but all they did was tell me id be paid for the lost time and that was about it so there we have it the story of how i had to be guilty because in very busy shopping center i was the only minimum wage peon in the area so it had to be my fault edit thanks to everyone whos reminded me what my rights are when dealing with a cop rest assured i am well aware of them however as i mentioned at the beginning of this story this was years ago i was a punk teenager who had never been in trouble with the law and honestly i had no clue and was completely freaked out that it was even being insinuated i was guilty of a crime
alright a bit of an over exaggeration but it was amazing i used to work at a movie rental store no not that one and had an awesome crew but my boss was the best he was a hard worker would do anything and everything to help the store he was behind the counter out in the floor cleaning ect now this story is a time he was behind the counter helping check in movies as i helped checking people out a couple came though the line and circled around to pick up the movies we are supposed to tell people about movies that are coming out the next week but i always forgot so my boss would pick up my slack as the man in the couple picked up the films my boss loudly told him that ps i love you was coming out next week but in the noise of the store it sounded like he only said i love you the man had the most frightened look on his face and quickly looked at me and at his wifegirlfriend before stammering out i love you too before practically running out the door i was lost in a fit of giggles as my boss turned to me and asked why the hell the customer said he loved him it took a little bit but i finally got him to understand he stopped promoting that movie to customers after tldr boss announces love customer returns it hesitantly
not your usual tfr story but a story nonetheless like most of us i do actually enjoy my job i get on great with my coworkers im good at what i do and generally enjoy going to work aside from one little thing my dm is a wretched person ill be told to follow a directive from her follow it to the letter then be yelled at for doing it she lies covers up major violations in her favorite stores treats everyone else like garbage shell refuse our schedules if they have any semblance of break coverage i even got an email from her talking trash about our store to another in the district that she sent us on accident and doesnt know we have like really she is terrible i now dread speaking with her because she has a knack for making me feel about inches tall regardless of what i do or how hard i work saturday was the last straw it was the final day of our fiscal year we had a sales goal for the year that if we made we would get a ft assistant management position opening in our store as we would have made enough to pay those hours and benefits and our store had it all set up we only have employees in our store and knew we would promote our pt assistant manager ft and i would would fill the pt slot so we hustled we made and then exceeded our goal pumped we were so pumped we worked so hard this year to make it and it paid off so our pt emailed our dm to inform her we made it and she would like to apply and our dm replies that she appreciated the offer but we needed an additional k to open that position after telling us all year otherwise i have never been so crushed at work ever i spent the past year not complaining about her for fear of being denied this promotion and now its gone now i have nothing to lose ive made the call am waiting to hear back from our head of hr to discuss everything ive started applying for other jobs just in case i get fired over this today i take a stand and quite possibly lose the best job ive ever had because i cant do it anymore edit called back dude is on the other line calling again in edit just got off the phone with him he seemed very shocked and taken aback by everything i heard told me he was going to speak to my rm who is conveniently out there for meetings so hell have face time with her hes going to speak to my store manager and be sure to address her concerns as well to solve this without retaliation being a thing 
i work at one of the largest department store companies in the country unfortunately one of our higher end competitors give customers everything they want so it sets them up for the conversation i had with a customer on the phone the other day i was working the fragrance counter when a customer calls me thank you for calling red star department store fragrances how may i help you customer hi i was in your store the other day and purchased a bottle of perfume but today it broke is there any way i can exchange it for a new one me definitely did it stop spraying or the cap bust or something customer no i knocked it off of my counter and it busted all over my floor i have the glass in a bag i can bring it in me so you dropped a glass bottle on the floor and it shattered and you think thats our responsibility im sorry but were not liable for that theres nothing we can do to replace the bottle customer thats ridiculous higher end retailer would never blame me for this me then you should probably buy your next fragrance from there hangs up
my friend and his family have owned a typical little convenience store in a rough neighborhood for more than fifteen years he and his family are legal immigrants from lebanon and nothing scares him hes had people try and rob him on occasion but if hes behind the counter its guaranteed they will be unsuccessful these are two of my favorite stories i wish you could hear them in his voice i will refer to him as j and customers as tm troublemakers one evening four roughlooking guys came in and went straight to the counter to look at the large bottles of liquor on the shelves behind my friend j good evening may i help you tm yeah how much is that bottle tm then pulls out a huge belt knife and uses it to point to the largest bottle on the top shelf his friends are trying to muffle their laughter j who then pulls out his sampw out of his waistband and points it to the same bottle you mean this one here he said the instant silence was priceless tm mumbled something and they quickly left another time close to closing another tm came in and quickly pulled out a handgun went to the counter and said quick old man give all your money in the drawer j stays calm with the gun pointed at his head and says okayokaylet me get it for you j opens the till calmly takes out all the bills stacks them into one pile and sets it on the counter directly between them when tm shifts his eyes to look at the stack of money j snatched the gun right out of tms hand and begins to examine it j you didnt really plan this very well did you you know you could have pawned this for a lot more than whats in that pile right there vaguely points the gun at tm i think you should just leave right now before something bad happens yes i loved hearing him tell me his stories edit those of you whove asked for more stories of j i will some asshole broke my pc and ive only had my phone to do this so it might take me a few of days i will tell j of his fans at reddit edit apparently this post was accidently deleted because it was two stories in one post right after i split them into two seperate posts a mod found it and put it back up so if you see the other two please dont be cross that they are the same storiesim just too tired to take them down i will be posting a couple more soon edit okay i deleted the two separate stories because i just know that they would give everyone false hope of a new story and then theyd be angry with me

so i had a customer come up to me this morning asking if a product worked for whatever he needed and i responded with absolutely it does customer why do you say absolutely me what do you mean what do you prefer me to say customer just dont say absolutely i dont like people saying that to me me umm okay customer do you have product anywhere without thinking i respond with absolutely if you follow that wall points to wall its to the left at this point he got very annoyed and just walked away no idea why he didnt like the word but i usually use it since it sounds polite in my language 
i work at a grocery store and yesterday i had the pleasure of babysitting the customers who decided to try their luck at selfcheckout about half way through my shift we were pretty slow we had about registers open not including the four selfcheckout registers and not many customers this woman walks up to one of the selfcheckout registers and begins to scan her items a couple items in she looks at me and gives me the come here motion with her finger as i am walking towards her i begin the question yes maam only to be interrupted by a coupon being shoved into my face and the rude lady rl for the rest of the story saying put this in for me the conversation goes as follows gtme you want me to put the coupon in for you gtrl i dont know how to do this i am not a checker she says this while waving the coupon about two inches from my face with each word she then shoves the coupon into my hand when she is done gtme when youre done scanning your items hit the pay now button and it will tell you how to scan your coupons i say this as i toss the coupon back onto her register so she continues scanning her items throwing things that she no longer wants into the candy bin behind her as i am retrieving some of these misplaced items she stops coworker cw who is walking by to help her ring up some avocados gtrl help we with these avocados i dont know how to work this gtcw oh this is how you do it he proceeds to type in the code for her and explains how she could do it herself for future reference gtrl god i better get put onto the payroll when im finished here lady youre the one who decided to go through selfcheckout
okay time for another story from the grocery store deli while the store itself is open hours the deli and meat departments which are right next to each other close at pm the meat department closes right at and they are usually gone soon after in the deli we have a little more cleaning to do after were technically closed so well be around until close to pm so the other day i get this lady that approaches me as im finishing up our closing tasks she asks where something in the meat department is since were right next to each i know my way around the department pretty well and know where stuff is she was asking about something that was on sale that week i took her to where it was and showed her she says no thats not what im looking for english obviously wasnt her first language so i thought maybe i misunderstood so i asked her to repeat it yep were standing directly in front of it she then pulls out the weekly ad and points at what she wants i point at the product right in front of us her no this pointing again i then pick up the product and put it next to the ad to show her this is whats in the ad she says no again then she gives up and walks away mumbling something about how i need to learn to do my job ugh not even my department 
so i work at a zoo located in the general location of not america my job mostly involves helping customers sign up for year membership passes occasionally we have those trying to sign up for a membership after purchasing tickets its not usually a problem seeing as we can refund the cost and let the customer only pay the difference this german man walked in with his family looking to sign up for a membership im assuming german because of his heavy accent on reaching my coworkers counter he mentioned that he had already bought tickets and asked if we could refund the cost cue the conversation co worker m german guy g m not a problem sir i can refund you the ticket cost all i need is your receipt we need the receipt to ensure he bought the tickets g why do you need my receipt m insert aforementioned spiel g why are you accusing me of fraud m no we just g this is ridiculous i dont need to give my receipt just do your job quickly we eventually found out the bastard just lost his receipt
when i was much younger i used to work as a server at a popular rotisserie chicken restaurant it wasnt a fancy joint being more of a fastfood dine in chain that made food that wasnt horrible but nothing special i typically handled small booths and tables of people each but on this night i had my usual section plus an additional party of about people to juggle all at once the worst is when everyone in a large party orders some kind of speciality drink one person wanting a mojito prepared a certain way or a double shot of this or that this party ordered a ton of drinks one of which was a bloody caesar ordered by an older gentleman after delivering the order to the bar i went about taking care of my regular tables and delivering the drinks and meals as they became available after about minutes the caesar wasnt yet ready and i kept getting looks from the old man as i brought everyone else their drinks another minutes go by and the drink still wasnt ready despite my inquiries at the bar and the old man points to his watch with a displeased look on his face i apologized and made a beeline for the bar where i asked the bartender to just make the drink before the old man blew a gasket and i stood there waiting as i waited a young couple came up to the bar to pay for their dinner they had a tiny little girl with them about years old who came and stood right next to me as i waited i paid little attention to them as i was stressing about my tables and the orders as they invariably piled up as i waited when the drink finally arrived i dont know if it was just stress excitement or a lack of attention and focus on my behalf but i grabbed that drink with the force of a thousand behemoths causing the liquid in the glass to fly up and out and down all over the little girls face standing next to me bloody caesar all over this childs innocent little smile and yellow jacket in slow motion i looked down realized what happened looked up saw the parents glare at me with a look of death that would rival luigis and back down to the child i uttered something that sounded like an apology before running to the kitchen to grab some paper towel and back out again to give it to the parents who looked like they were going to stab me with the nearest fork but before they could act on their murderous thoughts the little girl piped up and said good thing i was wearing my rain jacket huh daddy in the most charming and nonchalant way imaginable the parents both laughed their anger suddenly taken away by their daughters adorable observation and the father simply said oh suzy they actually smiled at me as i apologized and i felt my sudden fear vanish i got that old fucker his caesar and couldnt have cared less about the way he stared at me or what he thought its just a drink one of many drinks hell have in his life the little girl and her ability to break through the conventional reactions that adults have left me with a great memory and lesson which is to never get stressed out because even when bad things happen theres always a positive perspective to be found

first post be nice backstory so im and work part time in a major uk supermarket our store is unlike most supermarkets in that there is no nearby carpark and is located in the city centre i am the lucky person that gets to supervise the selfservice checkouts there is in total for one person to supervise one particularly busy period an obnoxious middle aged woman omaw interrupted me whilst i was helping another customer and demanded i show her how to use the machine i asked her to please be patient until i had finished helping the current customer and that i would be right with her when i got around to helping her she had already attempted to use the machine herself and had of course failed to follow any of the on screen instructions and had every possible error occurring at once me ok youve actually put your items on the wrong side of the checkout which is why youre getting these errors dont worry a lot of people make that mistake ill just sort it for you omaw huffs sighs tuts etc me is this your first time using one of these machines then omaw yes im in a big hurry ive just parked my car outside because i needed a couple of things before i go home i glance up to where she indicated and see her car parked literally outside the front door of the store right in the middle of a bus lane me right so all you have to do is i explain the procedure and even process a couple of items for her ok omaw yes fine i then go and help another machine that requires approval for alcohol before i get another tap on my shoulder omaw the stupid machine is broken me well lets have a look ok youve actually put all your items into the bagging area but none have been scanned omaw yes i did what you told me to do me well im afraid none of your items have registered if you did try to scan them lets put them through again this time i process her entire basket just to try and get rid of her omaw you cant tell me what to do youre probably not even out of your teens you have no right to tell me i did it wrong no right at all youre just a stupid little boy me quite obviously shocked at the outburst i was simply telling you what you may have done wrong omaw why do they hire young people when they are so rude where is your manager i personally love it when this happens so i go and get the manager causing more delays for herself and the other machines im supposed to be helping as well as a queue of people which has now formed manager hello there what seems to be the problem omaw yes this idiot youve employed is being very rude man well we take abuse in out store very seriously if i could just take some details off you omaw gives name address and telephone number man ok thank you for that id like to now tell you that you will be placed on the list of customers banned from the store i will not tolerate abuse to my staff good day omaw what i work for the council you cant do that man im afriad i can now are you going to leave or shall i call security to escort you off the premises omaw im going but i will close this store down just you wait until i get back to the office man ok then have a nice evening omaw storms out of the store gets into her illegaly parked car and drives the wrong way down a one way road straight into the path of an oncoming police car who gives her a fixed penalty notice on the spot all right outside the front of the store omaw looks around exasperated and then looks straight at me as i stand there staring right back with a huge grin on my face tldr middle aged council worker was unnecessarily rude to me was banned from store and received a fine from the police 
edit wow my first entry hit the front page of this sub id just like to point out that my first language isnt english so youll have to bear with me i tried making it good just found this sub and really wanted to share this story so i used to work at a tool store and we had quite a lot of tools to choose from relevant to the story i do work on my own and friends cars in my free time and that experience usually came in handy when finding the appropriate tools for people anyway one day a guy comes in through the doors and he has the look now most people might not be familiar with the look but anyone having worked in retail or the general service industry knows it its the look you get from people that are much much better than you and you should be grateful that they want to grace you with their presence yep this guy was one of them anyway the guy walks towards me and with a whiff of arrogance not too strong yet ascertaining his dominance barks do you have any insert specific tool brand wrenches unfortunately i dont sir but i do have insert different brand which is at least as good if not better lt it wasnt a lie he said something demeaning i cant quite remember what it was but brushed it off and i guided him to the relevant section while showing him our strongest wrenches i made a point of telling him where they were made how they were better than others etc as he had suggested that he wanted quality he cut me off and with slightly more arrogance than initially and without even bothering looking at me said yeah yeah thats what youre supposed to say combined with his tone and body language he heavily insinuat that i had no idea what i was talking about and didnt have the faintest idea on how to use tools i really cant do this guy justice with my writing skills he was a class act a bit surprised by his attitude i replied with the shipyard in town buys these wrenches from us and they say that theyre unbelievably strong and durable to which he replied again arrogantly yeah right ofcourse youd say that theyd better be fucking strong for what im going to use them for ive already snapped a mm insert preferred brand wrench snapping a wrench is not normal especially not one of the brand he was using so i asked what is it youre trying to do if you dont mind me asking while heavily hinting that i had no understanding of what he was doing he replied with im replacing the balljoints on my car and the upper ones are so fucking stuck that the wrench snapped as i was prying one of them out and starting turning away as not to waste more time on me i was as always friendly and polite throughout our entire interaction and with the exact same manner i said well no wonder you cant get it out youre doing it wrong he stopped dead in his tracks turned his head to look at me and said what me youre saying that one of the upper balljoints is stuck which tells me that its some kind of volkswagen correct with a dumbfounded look and while turning around to fully face me again he replied yes i now had his full attention and since it has multiple balljoints its going to be one of the larger volkswagens is it a passat he looked at me in disbelief and replied uhm yes it is me yeah youre not getting that balljoint off like that i could sell you one off these wrenches and youd most likely snap it as well and then i really started enjoying myself as i had to explain captain arrogance here how and why he had to do it differently i continued see a balljoint is tapered and when they start to rust they get really stuck you need to remove the bolt that goes through the recess and hit the knuckle with a hammer dont start hitting the balljoint as youll be doing it for a week and nothing will happen hit the knuckle i have to admit i felt pretty god damn awesome right then as i had proven to this arrogant fool that i was actually much more qualified than he was despite not having acted like an asshole him while still trying to keep his composure uhm well i guess ill go home and try that im still going to need the wrench though as mine is ruined the guy came back the following day and with a big ass smile on his face he said to me i hit it twice then it was out he treated me respectfully ever since
sorry for the length i got a bit carried away tldr woman tries to bring back abused cat gets arrested backround i own a acre plot of land that is part animal shelter and part pet store all of the money made from the pet store goes back to restocking and helping out the shelter the shelter has many different types of animals we take the normal dogs cats and rabbits but we also take birds gerbils reptiles snakes lizards ect guinea pigs horses and even the occasional raccoon or possum each animal species gets around an acre or two horses get three and they have that area to roam around and be free cats have an outdoor fenced in area to sit outside without getting out this system is the only way i started this place up my sister is the only vet so it can get pretty hectic the store is like a little pet boutique and we frequently get pet brands to donate items to our store story christmas is over and the people from retail can relax right my store offers a day money back guarantee for all items sold in the store the shelter offers a week trial period for all animals if the animal doesnt fit with your family or household you can bring it back no questions asked but there is a fee of dollars out of the original that the animal costs now our busiest time of year for pet adoptions are the holidays not a surprise parents getting their children cats or dogs or whatever is normal but it doesnt always end up well yesterday a woman that looked to be in her late thirties early forties came in the store with a box from now on well call her ch the conversation went like this ch hello i got this kitten for my mother but she didnt like it i remember somebody saying that i could give her back no questions asked me hi there yes we do offer a one week trial period do you have the papers so we can see the details of your adoption ch sure let me just grab them from my purse there they are here you go now at this point im just thinking that this is going to be easy and fast me thank you so much one moment while i read over it right off the bat i see that she adopted the cat a week and a half ago thats alright i could make an exception reading farther i see that the kitten was in perfect health great so we should have no problem me so i see you got this kitten a week and a half ago but i could make an exception just this once is there any other reason you didnt want her anymore ch my mother said she keeps on limping and her fur is super matted its a shame though she was so sweet now that interested me i opened up the box and what do you know theres a kitten showing signs of abuse blood on her fur and visible open wounds i told her i would be just a moment and took the poor thing to my sister to get some xrays done just by looking at her you can tell she was abused and the xray confirmed that her hind leg was broken i go up to the woman and tell her what my sister told me ch are you accusing my mother of abusing this cat thats absurd me miss im only telling you the obvious its obvious that this animal has been abused there is evidence of somebody kicking her legs and its broken that is why she limps ch how dare you my mother does not abuse animals i will just take that cat back thank you very much me im sorry but i cannot give you the kitten back ch i will sue you where is the manager let me speak to the manager me miss im the owner please leave my store before i call the police ch no i will not leave you cant make me by now my sister has called the police and after about ten minutes of trying to get this lady to leave the police show up once we show them the evidence they arrest ch for animal abuse i got a call later saying that she refused to pay the fine and is now looking at a month jail time the kitten on the other hand is going to be just fine a few weeks in a cast and a few stitches and she will be just fine edit wow im so surprised this got so popular im on my lunch break at the moment and your comments are so heartwarming i have many other stories for yall and would love to share my sister is actually going to be taking the cat for her three year old son since their old cat died about a year ago they named her coco 
it never ceases to amaze me how one can ask a person nicely to not punch a button that will piss off a lot of people at once at my store when i work graveyard shifts i tend to clock in minutes before my shift so i can get the pm to pm person out at and not have them sit around waiting on me so they get out at pm i do that because i also clock out at am the next morning so i get my hours for the day saturday may at pm the headache started while out checking the outside trashcans for any that may need changing i see a guy punch my emergency pump shut off button epsob which as the name implies immediately shuts down all of my gas pumps causing me to have to go reset them in the back office after witnessing his action on my defenseless button i ask him not to do that again because of what it does typical whatever reaction from him and he roams around the store for a few minutes in that time hes browsing i have people come in that i already know will pay for gas first then wait to pump i get a few of those customers out of the door and they start fueling when i ring up mr troublesome i tell him his total he pays apologizes for punching my epsob and leaves a second after that all of the gas pump icons on my registers screen go gray which means he hit the button again causing me to have to go reset my pumps again after that is settled and i put the remaining balances of all customers back on their pumps so they can finish fueling i go to clean up around the store typical things like mopping wiping things down facing my store all of that around a van pulls up and a group of hispanic male youths hop out and start standing on the sidewalk in front of my store people are currently fueling at this point in time when my pump icons go gray yet again i walk outside to see what was happening and theyre shoving each other having a good time cant fault them for enjoying themselves with a small bit of rough housing honestly i ask them to move away from the button because one of them caused my pumps to go down i hear numerous variations in spanish and english of i dont understand what youre saying typical response one gives the thumbs up and they go huddle around their van for a few i walk back in and resume cleaning only to have people walk invisibly angry and all want to know what is wrong with their pumps sure enough the icons are yet again grayed out causing me to go hit the pump reset button for the th time in only hours into my shift i apologize to these customers explain someone hit that nono button and that i can fix the problem easily but ask for just a minute for the systems to initialize everyones good to go to finish their fueling until i see one of the hispanic youths walk up smack the button and just stands in front of my store grinning ear to ear i dont know what it is with people but that is just nonsense im quite glad it was a somewhat easy night wasnt too happy about having to police my epsob for about a half hour though edit saturday was may rd not the th i shouldnt type things when i get home i guess
some context recently our managers decided that they werent going to look up purchase history unless they really had to because the system is slow and they have more important things to do we used to just have an unwritten policy that we wouldnt outright tell customers we could do it unless they asked but thats since changed to us having to play press secretary and weaseling our way out of it it hasnt been fun that said this happened last night at my warehouse club probably about twenty minutes to closing we still had some people in the store which is typical and not bothersome and three guys who are about thirty come up to my counter one shall be named adamant dude gt me hi how can i help you ad sets a perfectly folded dress shirt on the counter gtad hi yes i would like to return this gt me sure no problem do you have your membership card he sets it down on the counter and also tells me he has no receipt gt me not a problem is store credit okay gtad well i would really prefer back on my card but if not thats fine gtme okay great as long as its within days of purchase its not a problem gtad it should be yes so far so good right well if that was the case i wouldnt be writing this now would i i begin looking around the shirt for the price tag which seems to be missing i start squeezing the shirt all around and still cant find anything i look up the brand in the computer but the closest thing we have is an article number for a discontinued plaid dress shirt and the one he gave me is solid green if he bought this shirt from us its no longer in our system fudge gt me you wouldnt happen to have the price tag with you would you gtad no im afraid not you must have my purchase history on my card right you can look it up gt me i cant sorry i dont have access to that gtad well get me somebody who can i dont care if its a manager or corporate somebody can do it internal sigh oh jesus gt me just a moment let me get my walkie into walkie hey lp call me at the desk real quick the discussion is basically my lp manager telling me to tell him i cant do the refund but that shell be up there soon enough anyway gt me okay sir im sorry but i cant do the refund gtad what do you mean you cant do the refund you dont understand i want my money back you can give me my refund i know you can and here ladies and gentlemen is where i became a man gt me no sir you dont understand im an hourly employee i dont have access to information as sensitive as purchase history i cant look it up for you if i tried to do that i could lose my job that said ive got literally nothing to go on ive got no receipt ive got no price tag ive got nothing in the system that even matches the item you brought me so even if you had all those things you bought this shirt so long ago that the system wouldnt even recognize it as ours so no i cant do your refund ad and his friends stare at me like they got the wind knocked out of them i raise my eyebrow gtad well i guess ill just come back tomorrow ill keep it i guess see if my brother wants it and then he lets out this oh so original gem gtad i guess ill just have to go down the street to competitors and shop there gt me hah have at it hoss you go right ahead that said my manager will be here shortly if you want to see if shell do anything gtad no thats okay im running late anyway i have to go and the guy and his friends leave unknowingly crossing paths with my manager on the way out and you know what guys it felt good
i posted previously about this manager i had this girl was the epitome of dumb blonde like i said in the last post she didnt like to call the corporate line to have items in the store fixed one of our light fixtures started to fall out of the ceiling hanging on by only the cord the light was attached to in the ceiling it was a real eye sore and customers would crack jokes about it one day she comes to me the tallest person working that day and asks if ill fix it if she gets me the tools i oblige and off she goes to the back room maybe minutes later she returns with a glue stick i had to hold my tongue and think long and hard about how to approach in fact im sure i gave her seconds of the stupid blink gtmanager i dont think that will work she looks at the glue stick and replies gtit says its permanent distant vapid blink blink i take more deep breaths gtmanager glue sticks wont even hold my craft paper together she just turned and disappeared back into the back room i could no longer contain my fit of laughter when we met with our dm to talk about why she wasnt fit to run our store i relaid this story i told him i didnt feel any confidence in a manager like that and this was my favorite story about her

whilst i do work in retail in a fairly large supermarket ive never really had a customer complain however on a rare day off i managed to somehow attract an irate customer my mum turned last friday and i was able to wrangle the day off to take her out she loves antiques and quirky bricabrac things so i took her out and told her id buy her one such item theres a good few shops specialising in funky antiques and whatever else in a nearby seaside town so we went there for the day we were in one of these shops and there was only one other customer looking around in the same room as us whilst the owner was in the next room with another customer while looking my mum found a fireguard that she wanted i told her i thought it would look great in the living room but it would be much too heavy to take home on the train there was a sign at the till detailing the prices for local delivery free if you spent over if not which i read to my mum before continuing browsing on my own while she went into the next room recalling the situation logically the other customer in the room must of heard me telling my mum the prices and thought i worked there not knowing we were mother and daughter as i wandered back across the room the customer grabbed me and this pleasant exchange came to happen this customer shall be called rb short for rude bitch rb you get me a box now these delivery prices are extortionate and i simply refuse to pay them me i laugh rudely realising whats happened but decide to have some fun its hardly as if i set the prices is it rb you your manager whoever i dont care if you dont have a box then perhaps pop over to the business next door and get one me what makes you think its my job to rb as a sales assistant im certain you should be assisting me and helping me meet my needs listen im not paying for delivery just get me a box and ill happily carry the fucking vase home me i dont even live in this town nor do i work in this shop or even have the remotest interest in doing so but if i did work here this would be the part where i refuse a sale and tell you to fuck off sadly im just another customer like you so i cant really do that my mum and the owner then walked back in the room the owner shot rb a death glare and simply said im the manager i can tell you to do exactly that on your way please as rb did the walk of shame out of the door the owner me to choose something to keep for free as an apology for my terrible shopping experience in her shop

background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square foot of fireworks heaven ive posted a few other stories if youre interested story i setup in a smaller city in central florida and i go through the local police department to hire off duty officers for security when the tent is really busy the officers love the duty shift since its usually just getting paid to sit around and bs with my dad eat my moms fantastic cajun food seriously we now post a menu when we post the signup sheet and make sure that any thief or idiot thinks twice before doing something stupid im basically paying for peace of mind and to support local law enforcement always a good idea if youre a business owner over the years weve become good friends with several of the police officers and its not uncommon for the officers on duty to swing by and say hello when they are working security for us they are officially off duty with the city but for a police officer off duty is a relative term theyre still in uniform and in communication via radio here are a few of the crazy things involving our security detail that have happened over the years the officer was talking with a few customers when a call came over his radio he jumped up ran to his car and peeled out of the parking lot someone had robbed the bank across the street and about a half block down from us we can actually see the front door of the bank from inside the tent the officer arrived at the bank just as the robber was taking off in his car the officer forced him off the road and they busted him a few blocks away im setup in the parking lot of a large shopping center a manager from one of the businesses saw the police car parked by my tent and walked over to complain to the officer about a van parked across the lot near his store it was apparently abandoned there a week ago and was partially blocking one of the rows when the officer walked over to investigate he discovered the owner had odd inside the van a week ago he spent the rest of the day overseeing the investigation and cleanup i was running errands and passed by the tent when i saw three police cars and the fire marshall truck parked next to it i panicked and did a uturn so i could find out what was going on pulled into the parking lot like a maniac and rushed to the tent mom had made gumbo there were two officers that that just gotten off duty and one of the on duty officers having lunch the fire marshall had seen the police cars and stopped in to see what was up i needed a new pair of underwear the officer was sitting a table with my dad having lunch when his radio went off bank robbery same bank months later the robber had already fled the scene when the call came through our officer left to help in the search i think they caught the guy a couple of weeks later a police officer we know stopped by one evening to let me know that someone had used a stolen credit card at my store that day a woman couldnt find her purse and had called the credit card company the cc company gave her a list of charges that had been done that day on her card and she contacted the police it was a big purchase around and fortunately the cashier remembered the couple that had used the card the police took both of our statements four days later the couple walks into our tent again and starts to shop the cashier immediately recognized them and grabbed me to let me know we actually had an officer on site for security at the time and i quietly let her know the thieves were back she stepped out of the tent and called for backup on the radio there were a couple dozen people shopping at the time including or kids i decided to demo a fountain in the parking lot so we rounded up all the kids and had them leave the tent to go and watch four police officers swooped in and busted the couple they didnt put up a fight they found stolen purses in their car and lots of merchandise including my fireworks i was one of several companies to press charges they ended up taking a plea and are still in prison as far as i know to this day i am still amazed that they had to balls to walk right past the police officer at our door after ripping me off a few days earlier a quick follow up and vent by me the stolen fireworks were seized as evidence after the thieves took a plea deal the day of the trial all of the stolen merchandise including the fireworks were awarded by the judge to the families of the defendants thats rightthe judge gave all of the stolen merchandise to the families of the thieves they had hit almost a dozen stores i think they hit walmart for more than k including gift cards while we love our local law enforcement not really a big fan of the court system i spent hours doing statements interviews and depositions as a reward i was ripped off again this time by the court system apologies for the rant 
this happened yesterday and while its not very exciting i just wanted to share so i work different retail jobs one of which is a big red office supply store saturday and sunday we had a special coupon where if you brought it inyou got a free case of waterno purchase necessary doesnt sound that bad right except for the fact that customers are only allowed one coupon per person per day and management is super strict about it i know that even the richest of people would try to take advantage but i also live in a low income area where we have a flea market righttttt down the street any deals we have people come get our cheap shit and resell it for a higher price so anyway all day people came into the store i greeted them some greeted me back but mostly they ignored me and grabbed the water by the door came to my register and walked out we had entire families come in each holding a coupon im talking person groups and then it happened a couple came in both with coupon in hand they each came up first the woman who awkwardly asked some questions then her boyfriend who didnt even glance at me i told them to have a great day and they left a few minutes pass and a couple comes up its a little busy in the store and i am the only cashier scheduled for the day so i wasnt really paying attention but the couple looked oddly familiar they walked out with water my general manager walks up and says those people already got water make sure that doesnt happen again its one per person they just had different coats on after those words left his lips guess who walks back in general manager sir you guys already got water twice youre done for the day its one per customer water guy youre gonna deny me my coupon i am a new customer i just came in gm sir just because youre now wearing a hat doesnt mean youre a different person

in high school i was a cashier at a grocery store because youre here you know that just because someone is working as a cashier in a grocery store that they may be capable of higherorder thought its too bad the customers dont know this so i had an older lady come through my line i was polite asked her how she was doing etc i am scanning her order and she has two packs of ziploc bags they both ring up and she grabs one of the boxes from the belt after id scanned it thrusts it in my face and uses one of her knobbly fingers to aggressively point at the print on the box which reads buy one get one free she yells at me in the most derogatory way cant you read of course i can read have you noticed that the checkout terminal is full of text anyway i take the box from her knowing that when something is printed on the box like that its a manufacturer deal not a store deal so im not at all surprised that it did not ring up i read the text around the buy one get one free logo and point to the important part and say maam this is a manufacturer rebate you need to mail in both bar codes she meekly apologized and then was quiet for the rest of the order while i basked in the glory of showing her what a complete asshat she was
so i work in a pet store and one of the areas i cover is the fish department for some reason people just dont seem to care about the well being of fish as much as other animals and its part of my job to make sure any pet is going to a suitable home when it comes to fish and the lack of empathy people have for them it can be difficult to walk the line of not pissing off customers and protecting the fish some days i just dont care about the customers though the scene young couple yg as the guy did all the talking in the fish department holding a gallon tank no filter and some gravel approach me yg hi wed like some help me sure what can i do for you yg we have a goldfish at home and were going to get this tank as an upgrade for it and wed like to buy another goldfish to go with him they were both all happy and smiles at this point i already know im about to piss these people off so i try to go about it in the nicest way possible me in my best im a happy person that would love to help you voice ok that tank is not going to be a suitable habitat for one goldfish they get big produce a lot waste and really need a big tank with proper filtration i can show you a tank that would work for the one goldfish that you already have yg smiles completely gone now what size tank will it need me a g is the minimum tank size for a goldfish yg yeah we dont really have room for that wont it just grow to the size of the tank me still trying to be polite in a way yes the fishs growth will be stunted the ammonia in the water can burn the fishs gills and the lifespan of the fish is dramatically shorter as the small space and poor living conditions will kill it a goldfish in a good size tank will grow to about inches and live for about years yg how long would it live in this size tank me the fish would be lucky to live a couple of years yay so far they havent been rude or got mad annoyed but whatever theyve listened to my whole spiel surely they understand now ha the young guy looks at they young lady hes with she kind of tilts her head to the side and says im ok with that the yg nods on agreement and says yeah im ok with that too looks at me and says yeah well get another goldfish me no more fucks to be given no you wont i have to make sure the animals arent going to suffer once they leave the store i cant sell you one cue awkward stare off at the end of which i remember that im supposed to be nice and throw in a retail smile yg ok they took the upgrade tank and sat it on the counter we have in the fish department and walked out im glad none of my fish went with them but i still feel bad about the fish they have
considering the overwhelming amount of response from my last tale i figured id share one that happened in my workplace a couple of months ago a customer made my coworker an older lady in her s cry in the middle of the sales floor its just another uneventful day in the store everyone is busy cleaning stocking refolding clothes and everything else that comes with working a small store a customer suddenly walks in with her husband and im not exaggerating when i say she was the sweetest person ive dealt with in my time at this store so i greet her with the typical hey how are you doing what brings you in today and she makes the effort to ask me how my days going and starts a conversation i help her out with what she needs to get we keep talking about school and how things are going with me and all of a sudden out walks my coworker well call her susan now susan is known by everyone who comes into the store she just finished her th year here and shes not leaving any time soon she deals well with customers helps them out and teaches everyone else how to work better so it turns out this lady had been helped by susan a few months back while the lady had been using a walker due to back surgery shes walking fine now so she walks over and gives susan a huge hug and says wait here ive got something for you in my car when she comes back in she hands susan a single longstem rose and says thats for all you did for me back when i wasnt so mobile and how youre always pleasant and happy when i see you thank you for everything you do at this point susan is crying and my faith in humanity is completely restored i havent seen that customer back since but if i ever do ill make sure she gets special treatment because she is one of the lucky few who realize that retail slaves are actually people and appreciates us

hello tfr i work in a coffee shop in an international flying area so we meet some pretty interesting people this story has been grinding my beans since it happened on sunday night a quick relevant detail my coffee shop is large circular shape so when im making peoples orders especially if theyre blended ive got to face away from the front counter to use the blender or urns or coffee grinder or coffee merch like tshirts or to grab teas and syrups allonsy picture it pm on a sunday during the slow months usually this means that the end of a concourse is pretty empty no one is flying in no one is flying out food employees are pretty much just standing around waiting until their portmandated closing time finally comes around pm cue my cool boss man leaving an hour early suddenly mass amounts of people decide all at once that the only nongreenmermaidcoffee shop in the building is the hip place to be within a few minutes i had about separate people in line i embrace this kind of chaos though since i had been sitting around twiddling my thumbs for a good hour i take a deep breath put on a sincere smile and began to plow through the long line of jetlagged people needing their caffeine fix the line was whittling down a steady rate everyone is happy jokes are being told witty banter is thrown about and im rushing around the coffee kiosk making smoothies milkshakes iced amp hot espresso drinks etc with exceptional finesse tips were pouring in the nice crisp green ones i counted at least just in bills i learned later that there were three delayed flights all at the same time down at my end something that doesnt happen that often this means that sometimes more flights will be delayed waiting for the first delay to leave thus the rush of people hours iater at closing time i told my last customer to have a nice flight then i shut the lights off and rushed around the store pulling in product and closing off the opening where the lines could begin i clocked out at and dumped my tip jar on the counter to see how much extra dough i earned that day right away i knew something was wrong the dollar pile was sparse my suspicions were confirmed and some change at some point in the breaks between crowds some jackass reached into my jar when i had my back turned and helped themselves to a handful of dollar bills i sigh to myself this is the th time this has happened since september i consider making a tipjar with teeth to trap the next thief ah retail
so i work in a big box home improvement retail chain in the us on my phone blah blah blah so i have a lot of stories i have been wanting to post this one is more funny than rage inducing so the store i work at is open until pm except on sundays we close at pm so last sunday i was closing due to it being slow i got out at about i was outside waiting for my ride talking to the wife of one of my coworkers as she waited for him to be done a man pulled up in his pickup and started yelling at me why are you closed so early that is illegal me we close at on sundays the hours are listed on the door as well as online him it isnt sunday you dumb bitch me i assure you it is him what no checks phone oh well thank you me you are very welcome him no you are welcome fuck you bitch he then proceeded to speed around me in the parking lot doing donuts and tried to be intimidating i just stood there smoking and waiting for him to leave it was made better by the fact that my coworkers wife was sitting there with a look of terror on her face and was surprised that someone would talk to me like that i told her every fucking day 
so bio i work at a pretty midtohigh end clothing store aimed at fashionable year olds most of the time my job basically consists of organizing stockchecking and occasionally when we have a lot of employees on staff walking around as securityloss prevention this one particular day last week to be precise i was making a round in the mens side when i noticed this suspicious looking dude with a bag from another store by the novelty polos our hightheft items so i walk over ask the guy if he needs help and tells me nah bro just browsing and walks off without another word ok red flag i then spot him picking up at least novelty polos and taking them to the fits where he takes around minutes and then walks out a relatively short time to try on polos red flag he decided to leave polos at the fits folding table and then walks over to the registers i noticed he only had polo in his hand as i skim over the fits folding table i only find the th one nowhere to be seen i know exactly where it is as soon as the guy pays out at the register for his single polo and walks through the door what do i hear but the blaring of the security alarm for reference almost everything in our store has a security sensor on it the second the alarm sounds i walk over and instinctively hands me the bag from our store i check it halfassedly knowing the real prize is somewhere else i ask to check his bag from another store he hands it over and what do i find the stolen polo security sensor in tow i immediately bust it out to him oh no need to worry im a secret shopper i was testing the employees here to see if they were capable of spotting shoplifting it seems your store passed because of you ill let the company know ill put in a call later on to store manager that you did a good job at this point i ask him for the badge that secret shoppers from our company get to verify authenticity in a heartbeat the motherfucker scrams throwing the polo on the floor and runs out the door you almost got me you sneaky bastard

a little background here in the s and s my grandad owned an equipment rental business and had my grandma and mom doing book keeping answering phones stuff like that this is a story of what my mom overheard one day while at the counter gd is grandad obc is oblivious customer obc was there to rent a garden tiller and was shooting the breeze with gd obc mentioned it was his first time starting a garden obc so what all can you plant in a garden gd oh shit anything really squash tomatoes carrots okra peas macaroni obc wait did you say macaroni gd yep obc i thought macaroni was where do you even get the seeds gd ya just need to go to the grocery store and grab a bag of macaroni of the shelf gd proceeded to instruct obc on what brand of macaroni to get how far apart to plant them how deep how much sunlight they needed and how much water they needed obc left with his newfound information and his rented tiller when obc returned the following week he informed gd that he had followed exactly what he had been told to do and was looking forward to having his own macaroni plants weeks pass and obc comes back into the rental shop for a lawn mower and mentions to gd that none of his macaroni had sprouted gd says as straight faced as ever oh ya musta had a bad bag
i never usually post here because im not sure if my job counts as retail its usually more customer service but today i was taking calls at my job and a woman calls to make a booking for a special type of food event we have we have a set price per person she wants to book for adults and a child i ask her what age the child is because the childrens menus only goes up to age a bit sucky i know but i dont make the rules turns out the child is so i tell her that her child will have to pay the adult price she goes ballistic but he wont eat the adult meal just put him down for the childs menu etc i tell her i cant do it so she changes her story and suddenly the child is fine be like that i dont care money doesnt come out of my pocket then it comes to making the booking because these events are insanely popular we require payment at the time of booking i explain this to her no ill pay for it on friday ok but i can not save the tickets for you until then the system only allows me to reserve the tickets when the payment is taken well you have to put them aside for me until friday my mother has breast cancer excuse me what what has that got to do with it im sorry but this system doesnt allow me to to do that if you want to call on friday or do it on our website youll need to risk not getting the time you want oh so this is how you welcome people to city name removed to protect the me you cant even do this thing for me even though my mother has breast cancer i explained to her i was very sorry but there is no way i could make the system do something it cant do and point out that if she paid today it was unlikely the money would leave the account before friday but shes having none of it and apparently is going to complain to my manager who im very lucky is a really cool guy and wont punish me because he knows im good at my job and do not lose my cool until after the customers are safely out of ear shot but i am absolutely shaking with rage what kind of person does that what kind of person uses the fact their own mother has cancer in order to try and get special treatment for themselves its not even as if she was doing this a treat for her mother then perhaps i might have understood but no its for her her husband and her kid i absolutely despair of some people sorry if this is a tad muddled im still in rage mode 
i used to work at an office supply store the amount of shoplifting we got was insane im walking towards the back of my store restocking some shelves when a woman comes up to me holding a small address book gthi i just wanted to check to see if the price for this was correct i used the price scanner and it said that cant be right i know all of those little books are disproportionately expensive so im pretty sure the price is correct i check for her anyway gtyep it looks like its sorry about that for some reason all of those address books are oddly expensive gtthats ridiculous im just gonna steal it then gtok and i walked away if she really wanted to steal it its our policy not to stop them which is probably why we have so much theft in the first place i didnt stick around to see if she actually did take it or not but im pretty positive she did im just glad i dont have to deal with those customers anymore edit and sorry about the formatting on mobile so its a mess
i used to work in a large home improvement store as their garden specialist my duties were not limited to just futzing with the flowers but also included driving forklift and unloading the plant delivery trucks june and july were the busiest months and sometimes we had or trucks a day to unload and process all the while customers were trying to yank stuff off the racks before i could check the inventory in we worked in the side parking lot of our store and would set out safety cones to block off the work area running the forklift counting plants scanning them in etc so im unloading my th truck of the day space all blocked off when this lady pulls into the lot and proceeds to drive over of my orange safety cones i send one of my helpers over to tell her that she cant park there for safety reasons and that we need the area for unloading trucks lady gets all huffy and says that she will park any place she wants and if i dont like tough but she spends thousands of dollars in our store and she can park where ever she wants i hate that spiel it just pushes my button my one co worker looks at me and then starts to shake her head she knows im irked and that the lady may be sorry she opened her big mouth mins later lady comes back from her quick errand only to find her car surrounded by racks of plants she had just enough room to squeeze into her drivers side door but couldnt pull out of her spot we the employees had all conveniently vanished from the area and we watched from a spot back by all the mulch stacks i then walked out near were she was and she wanted to know when we were going to move the racks from around her car and why did we put them there and it wasnt right andandand she was sputtering mad i replied nicely oh in about mins when my help came back from their break and that i had warned her not to park there because we needed the space for our unloading and that i couldnt move them by myself because it was against policy to run equipment when customers were in the area and it would take two of us to do it by hand needless to say i didnt see her again in our store
i was blowing up balloons for some promotion at my work and there was a little cutie probs years old with her dad and little sibling looking at me curiously she was soooo adorable so i walked over to her and asked if she wanted a balloon she happily said yes and when i handed it over she proudly announced that she also knew how to blow up a balloon herself i gave her an unblown balloon saying me here you go you can blow this balloon up for your little brother little girl thats not my brother thats my little sister me cringing ohim really bad atkids faces little girl toothy grin but thats alright she looks like a boy anyway dad yeah we get that a lot man this is why i suuuuuck at talking to kids edit i should add that the dad was super chill about it and thanked me for the balloons top dude it didnt stop my coworkers from laughing at me though
im not sure this deserves an update but after posting people can be vicious cried at work for the first time about three months ago i got a lot of pms not regarding jill or other customers but regarding my manager these past few weeks have been absolutely insane since this incident our staff began to have more and more problems with this manager disrespecting us embarrassing us and just making our lives miserable we came close to having a lot of great people quit and we went home every night absolutely hating our jobs things got really bad for a while finally i decided enough was enough and i gathered everyone that had talked to me about their issues with him and decided to take it to our store manager and have one big meeting this decision terrified me i havent been there nearly as long as some of the others and im low on the food chain my decision could have gotten me in serious trouble or even terminated i figured if i was going to get fired for speaking up about the harassment we were enduring then i didnt want to work there anyways the meeting lasted about an hour or so and we didnt even get everything out that we had wanted to say it was time to go back to work we were told things would get sorted out the next day i come in to this weird aura everyone was in a good mood customers were happy and i didnt see the grumpy miserable faces i usually saw when i got to work my manager no longer worked for the company this was enough to celebrate but what would come next was even better we all began to wonder who would take his job we all got along with each other so it was fair game they talked for a while about hiring someone brand new and that made us a bit nervous it could be someone just as bad or worse than the original manager theres a lot of meetings and closed doors and finally i get called in long story short i got the job im young and have no experience with management and i got the job im beyond proud of myself and im excited to see what i can do for our store things are turning up tldr action was finally taken against my manager and i was offered his job edit thank you to ukalikojak for reddit gold youre awesome
i work at a gas station and for the last few months weve had a promotion with a department store and if you spend so much money at that store you get a coupon for a discount on gas at my store sounds kinda confusing typing that out but the main idea is lots of people have coupons to save money on gas around here anyway one day a lady comes in with said coupon however this coupon looked like it went through hell looked like it sat in the sun for a while draining it of its color some weird looking dirt smudged around it and on top of that it was moist i shudder just thinking about it however none of those are reasons why i didnt accept it i couldnt accept her coupon because there was no bar code i tried to politely tell her that unfortunately without the bar code i wouldnt be able to take her coupon and she started grinning and snidely said actually you are legally required to take my coupon i know these games you guys play here and if you try and play me ill call the cops on you now ladies and gentlemen im not very familiar with coupon law but i do know my companys policy and knew for a fact that this coupon was void without the bar code we arent allowed to discount gas manually at this point as im sure you all expected she was asking for a manager i called my manager over to deal with this and he said the same thing to her as i did at this point she was smiling ear to ear like she found pleasure in confrontations like this she again said we legally had to take it and my manager was starting to get fed up with her he told her again theres absolutely no way we can use her coupon for all we knew it had already been used well the lady wasnt backing down and began loudly exclaiming how she was going to call our corporate office and file a complaint on all of us during her speech about how terrible we all were my manager began laughing he told the lady to look at the coupon i took a peek myself to see what he thought was so funny turns out the coupon expired a week ago so even if it had the bar code we still couldnt take it she stared at it for a second and started muttering well itsyou still then she left she just walked out without saying another word just another day
so for a short time i use to work at this little gas station out in the middle of nowhere one day im standing at the cash register and this older cracked out lady comes into a store with an empty fountain cup in her hand i think nothing of it because we sell refills i watch her go over to the soda fountain and put the cup back with the other cups and then continue looking around the store im a bit confused so i ask her about it the following conversation then takes place customer that was my old cup i washed it its clean someone else can use it me you mean you drank out of it customer yes but i washed it me youre suppose to throw them away when youre done customer why its still a perfectly good cup im not going to waste that cup why would i throw away a cup that someone else can use i dont like being wasteful like that me but you drank out of it your mouth was on it thats disgusting customer are you calling me disgusting now i always wash my cups and return them here you should be thanking me i save you guys a lot of cups finally she starts to leave the store while still going on this rant about the environment and how wasteful our store is as soon as she is gone i go throw all the cups away and thats why i never buy fountain drinks anymore
when i had just turned i was working as a cashier at a now defunct grocery chain the money and hours sucked but i was at that point in life where i needed to make some money while deciding what the hell to do with my life our store had an employee policy that basically stated that if you went on break and bought something to eat there you could ring yourself up for it after you were off break essentially if you grabbed some hot wings and a soda you didnt have to pay until you came back simple my period was late i was nauseous etc all day at work i was sweaty and nervous hoping to god i wasnt pregnant there had been a condom breakage i wasnt simply irresponsible my break came and i worked up the nerve i knew we had pregnancy tests on sale and i went and grabbed one while in the aisle i noticed our lp guy doing his rounds and thought nothing of it i took my test to the bathroom with the intent of discretely ringing it up as soon as i was off break and getting rid of the box it was only and due to a lucky scratch off ticket from the day before i had in my purse relevant i follow the instructions and boom im preggers i was in disbelief panicked and sweating profusely my head was spinning i put the box in the pocket of my apron pull myself together for the last few hours of my shift and begin trying to figure out how i was going to tell my mother as im walking down one of the aisles towards the registers the lp guy swept up behind me grabbed the back of my arm quite forcefully and without a word dragged me to the back offices i kept asking what the hell was going on but he wouldnt speak he placed me in his office left and locked the door what the fuck was going on a few minutes later he returned with the manager and my piss soaked stick test in his gloved hand he began to accuse me of stealing i quickly retorted that he had grabbed me on my way to my register and just like everything else an employee grabs when on break i was going to pay for it once i was back on my register my manager seemed confused and unsure of the lp guys accusation and asked if i actually had the money to pay for it my purse was in a hidden cubby under the register and he went and got it for me while lp guy takes it upon himself to call the cops my manager returned and i proceeded to show him that i had more then enough money to pay for the item lp guy shoots back that i wouldnt of tried to hide the box in my apron if thats what i was going to do i angrily explained that i didnt need the whole store knowing my business and i was going to be discrete he wasnt going for it in a store frequented by wealthy elderly people shoplifting wasnt an issue and i believe in his mind he was finally getting the chance to bust someone i demanded to call my mother no it wasnt because i needed my mommy it was because i wanted a ride home youre sweetheart no mommies here and he ripped the phone from my hand up until this point i had raised my voice but had refrained from cussing name calling etc i had just found out i was pregnant and within minutes of trying to soak that in i had a man who had obviously failed the training to be a cop accusing me of trying to steal a pregnancy test i was emotional and i dont think anyone could blame me he slammed a piece of paper in front of me and began to demand i sign it it was a statement saying i admit to stealing i refused and attempted to leave he blocked the door and told me i wasnt going anywhere and physically seated me again he kept screaming and pointing at the paper and i was praying that the cops would just show up he tells me i cant leave the office until i sign it and left the room locking the door behind him it was a big door and there was no way i could force it down i took the opportunity to call my mom and simply got the words come quick out of my mouth before he stormed back in and removed the phone from the room altogether at that moment i tried to juke him to get out of the office to find he had manned the hallway with some of the stock guys and i was physically pushed back into the room and locked in once again i was in complete panic mode after what seemed like a lifetime i just signed the paper and as i was sliding it under the door as proof i heard the sounds of police radios finally lp guy opens the door an enters with officers he had obviously already gone thru his version of things and now they wanted to hear from me i went thru the whole thing and the stock guys confirmed that paying for things postbreak was common i showed them my money etc they could tell i was flustered and one noted the pee stick in the table and saw that it was positive they talked amongst themselves for a few minutes before i heard my mother at the customer service desk demanding to know where i was she dont play the officers close the door so its just me lp guy and them did she attempt to leave the store without paying one asked no i caught her in the aisle lp responded so she wasnt near an exit running anything like that one of them asked no caught the sneaky bitch before she could leave to me were you clicked back in yes i was headed to my register to pay like everyone does lying bitch lp shot back meanwhile i could hear the manger trying to keep my mom from ripping his throat out yes my mother is that tough i was gonna leave i dont have a car i dont even drive you fucking moron the officers turned to lp guy who was gripping my signed statement ok from what weve gathered she was in the clock and following your stores policy she didnt try to leave so no shoplifting or attempted shoplifting occurred lp began to argue only to be met by a quick and authoritative hand in his face sir you moved this girl against her will about feet another hundred and wed be arresting you for kidnapping you locked her in this office thats imprisonment he may have used a different term cant recall and the fire marshall would have your head lp shoved the paper at them she admitted it the officer grinned that was signed under duress and my partner and i will testify to that if need be if you lock someone in a room long enough you can force them to admit to just about anything second cop miss this seems like a real shitty case of jumping the gun do you want to press charges her for what lp guy freaked i just told you youd be better at your job if you watched and listened i told them no not only did i have to tell my panicked mom i was pregnant but i had to explain this too i didnt want to get wrapped up in any of that i just wanted to go home and cry i put the on the desk table and one of the officers escorted me to the customer service desk and assured my mother i wasnt in trouble in fact i was a victim my manager was clueless as to what had just happened and the officers merely told him she could have brought major trouble for this place i wouldnt fire her if i were you before he could answer i merely said fuck this job and left with my mother a year later the chain went bankrupt and a few months after that i saw lp guy pumping ppls gas in nj if youre out their lp guy fuck you edit first of all thank you for all your kind words i never expected one of the worst days of my life would touch so many people looking back yes i should have pressed charges in that moment tho i just wanted out id never had any dealings with the law before this and had no idea what pro bono meant etc my whole life had changed in that bathroom and my head was swimming and i felt like i was trying to breathe underwater if something like this happened now i would be all over it with an army of lawyers but at the time i was still a kid i have no idea if they fired lp guy over this i only went back weeks later to collect my final paycheck i could of had it mailed but i wanted to walk in with my head held high and thats just what i did a small way of taking back my own sense of security i hope no one ever has to go thru what i went thru that day and i also hope that if anyones rights are violated they are braver then i and do press charges that is something i regret immensely about the situation but in my eyes at the time an year old vs an army of corporate hired lawyers didnt make for good odds 
i work at a national chain craft store my coworkers always joke about how stonecold and deadpan i can get when people are yelling at me theres this huge fad out right now with this rubber band weaving loom we carry them and right now theyre on sale and so are the individual packages of refill rubber bands the display theyre set up on is right in front of the door when you walk into the store with the registers being immediately to the right of the door now the store always has some sort of coupon out usually its a off one regular priced item if something is on sale already the coupon doesnt work on it so yesterday this ornery looking lady comes to my register with a loom about packages of rubber band refills and a handful of gewgaws from the clearance bins there are one or two other small things that are regular price she presents the off coupon and another off the whole order i scan all of her items and put them in the bag while she scrutinizes the screen on her side when i get to the coupons they only take a tiny amount off when i tell her the total this happens ornery lady why didnt you use my coupons thats way too much i cant afford that me i did but they dont work on things that are already on sale it took the and off of your nonsale items they were pretty cheap already so it only took a few cents off ol thats bullshit this is totally illegal its false advertising it doesnt say anywhere that i cant use coupons for sale items give me my damn discount i need these me im sorry but it does say right here on the coupon that sale items are excluded and on a very large sign on the loom display itself that no additional coupons or discounts can be used on the loom stuff and all of this other stuff is already on clearance ol shouting now what sign theres no sign this is bullshit youre trying to steal my money i calmly walk five feet over to the display and pick up the bright yellow sign that says no additional discounts may be applied to loom products and hold it up to show her she visibly puffs up and bellows you little bitch i will never shop here again i spend a lot of money here you just lost a very important customer she storms out and my manager runs up to me she exclaims what on earth just happened are you okay yeah that lady was just mad because she cant read

i was working the cash register today as always because the cosmos and management are in on the same sick and twisted joke when a woman came up to my counter to check out i thought it would go smoothly despite her ignoring my greeting and rolling her eyes when i asked as cheerfully as possible if there was anything else i could help her with look lady i get that you think im a robot but we all gotta do what we gotta do she doesnt say a word to me and starts pulling her wallet out of her purse then her phone rings and rings and rings its a nice little ringtone and i think maybe she is just going to let it go to voicemail since she is paying nope she stops everything to make a big fuss about pulling out her phone and answering the call from the conversation i can tell that she is a very important real estate agent and she is about ready to close a huuuuuge deal or whatever as she is on the phone she decides she wants to enter her phone number into the pinpad in order to use her store rewardssavings account cool she can do that but she keeps hitting cancel instead of look up number shell hit the red x button instead of the green enter button time and time again she does this still on the phone with her client my line is building this isnt working its not taking my number she says and keeps trying i try to say just hit enter but she interrupts me by holding up her index finger to tell whoever is on the other line that the cashier doesnt know what theyre doing she tries to reenter her phone number maybe three more times every time she hits the wrong button and she starts over i am visually wincing when she hovers over the correct button to complete the process and decides on the wrong button again the regular in line behind her is chuckling yeah just forget it she says and just goes to swipe her credit card okaaaaaay jeeze she finally hangs up with the person on her phone and her payment goes through she looks up at me and says you need more training fuck you very much lady 
i work in a big retail chain near the front we have a little value section with items that are or dollars changes seasonally its a fun little place to find cheap crap and occasionally a surprisingly good value one of the items that we always have over there are these file folders theyre plastic different colors very useful things they come in sizesthe smaller is roughly the size of a clutch purse the larger one is like a folder size theyre both a dollar which i found interesting i assumed it was for the smaller and for the larger a woman came through my register with a ton of clearance items all the cliche coupon deals etc i turned off my light because i could tell there was going to be a lot to explain and argue over during this transaction i see her a lot i was right there was a lot of back and forth over how if a sale says buy get one free you actually have to buy total items you cant just have me void of them and get a free thing and i know she is fully aware of this crap just tries to get away with stuff and confuse cashiers anyway i digress my favorite part of the conversation is as follows i ring up several of the aforementioned folders she had maybe of each size gt woman wait the small one is a dollar too gt me yes theyre both a dollar cool right i always thought the big one was gt woman im not paying that i thought the small one would be like cents gt me no everything over there is or gt woman well im not paying that gt me ok so do you not want just the small ones or do you not want either size gt woman no i still want them gt me alright keeps scanning her other items gt woman no im not paying a dollar for those little ones gt me wellthats the price so if you want them theyre a dollar we really dont have sales on that section if something is out of season like easter or christmas stuff it can be on clearance but we dont have that going on right now im trying my best to explain to her why this is absolutely a dollar no questions about it gtwoman i am not paying that gtme ok then you dont want the small ones i then void out the smaller folders and just move on im not going to be intimidated by her because i think thats what shes going for thankfully i think she realized that im not giving in and she just didnt talk for the rest of the transaction
years back i used to visit my friend who worked at a now closed electronics chain for lunch and would occasionally hang out after for a while my pal was closing down his station at the help desk so we could leave for lunch as he was doing that i noticed a man walk in something caught his attention the rather large display for the off hd dvd speaker system sets needless to say these boxes were fucking gigantic which is probably why the company was fine with putting them right next to the door the man quickly looked around and either missed me staring at him or assumed i wouldnt care because he didnt hesitate at all he bent down to grab the box and picked up in a way that looked as if it were designed to slip a disk however there was only ten feet between him and the door he was practically home free all he had to do was leave he must have made it two steps into his waddlerun before he dropped the box and fell over it it really wasnt that hard of a fall in retrospect he was barely moving and the box was so large that he didnt trip over it as much as fall on it with that in mind he still hit the tile floor face first i gasped and my friend looked over horrified before shouting out sir are you okay the man shot up to his feet he touched his hand to his forehead which was bright pink as if he had been paddled and then to his nose which was starting to drip little droplets of blood he darted quickly out of the door and into the parking lot never to be seen again
this is actually my dads story but its his favorite from all his years of working retail which is years so hes working one day and he gets a phone call from customer c customer clearly sounds like an older man and he has a really thick accent my dad employee or e puts something aside that customer will come in to pick up within the hour its about two hours later and my dad gets a phone call from customer gte thanks for calling retail store how may i help you gtc hello is this mr employee this is mr customer from before gte yes hello mr customer i have your item set aside i thought you were going to be coming in gtc im here but everybody is gone gte what do you mean nobody else is here im standing right at the front door were actually quite busy today theres a bunch of people here gtc i knock on the door yelling mr employee mr employee please let me in but nobody answer ive been doing this for almost an hour but nobody let me in gte okay mr customer im looking out into the parking lot and i dont see anyone where are you now gtc im at the pay phone im looking right at the front door at this point my dad realizes something isnt right because the only pay phone in the area was around the back of the shopping center it would be impossible for him to be at the phone and looking at the front doors so my dad asks him to describe what he sees and my dad immediately catches on the store that my dad works at has two locations and one is closed on sundays because of blue laws which were invented to minimize traffic on sundays it happened to be a sunday and customer was at that closed store instead my dad felt so bad but couldnt stop laughing at the thought of his old man pounding on the doors for over an hour of a store that was clearly empty even though my dad kept insisting to him that they were open luckily the stores arent really far away so customer was able to drive to the one that was open to pick up what he needed based on his voice my dad picked him out as soon as he walked into the store he saw him and yelled mr customer and customer yelled mr employee it was as if they were lifelong best friends
okay this isnt my story but a coworker told me about this customer he had today coworker co paranoid customer pc okay so co was standing at his register at the grocery store kind of a slow day at least at that moment hes got his hands in his pockets as kids sometimes do pc approaches and asks if he has a cell phone in his pocket co yes pc are you touching the cell phone co yes pc well ill have you know that the government has installed devices in cell phones to hurt other people just by touching the phone and youre making my feet hurt by touching your phone co silence pc walks off she apparently came by later and complimented co on not having his hands in his pockets and how her feet felt much better

a woman brought a dead electronic item to our return counter and insisted that she bought it from us along with an extended warranty but she had no receipt a half hour of searching our database for the transaction turned up nothing under her name the woman left briefly and i asked the cashier could she have bought it under another name or a company name the cashier said i already asked and she said no after another minutes of fruitless looking i asked the woman if she could have given another name during the purchase no she barked glaring at me the cashier finally found the transaction in our database by searching for the womans email address the transaction listed the womans correct email address her street address and her phone number and an entirely different name oh thats just another name i use sometimes she said avoiding eye contact
hello tales from retail so i was not directly involved in this but i wanted to share it because i thought it might give some hope today i was shopping at a local store and there was a mother and her child the store isnt some big chain localy owned and all that the child was being a brat he was screaming knocking stuff around total posessed child from hell routine up walks an underpaid staffer gt ups maam i have to ask you to please calm your child they are bothering the other customers badmom johnny i dont remember the kids name cut that shit out to ups happy the kid stopped the worker smiled and said yes and returned to what she was doing a few minutes later and the kid is back at it louder angrier worse again ups walks over and smiles nicely gtups maam please he is really causing a neusence bm piss off i tried ups if you cant control your child then you will have to leave maam please understand of course this is likely the store policy but hell if she wanted to hear that badmom starts with her indignent i did nothing wrong i want to see your supervisor raging through the back doors walks an older gentleman maybe or at least stressed to that point he politely asks what is going on and the mother loweing her voice only some tells him how this little tramp of an employee demanded she leave because of her child he lets ups explain her side then asks a passing customer if the child has indeed been screaming and making trouble quite a few heads nod he then turns and asks badmom to leave and take her child with her she freaks out demanding the owner screams all kinds of profanity then this exchange happens gtsmilingman dear lady i am the owner of this fine establishment as ups explained your child has been causing a ruckus and bothering our other patrons please take your child and leave i will watch your basket and you can return for your purchase later bm you can go to hell my son was fine you need to treat your customers with more respect i am telling everyone i know about how you and your employees hate children sm we dont hate children just yours please leave before i call the police if i catch you here again its trespassing and i will press charges she huffed and puffed and stomped out knocking over a newspaper stand on her way he then apologized to every customer and asked ups if she was okay or if she needed a break so hey there are good managers and owners and sometimes the bad people get told off remember there is light somewhere in the tunnel 
so a couple weeks ago i was working a solo evening shift at a sandwich shop in a local gas station its about pm and its been dead quiet all day so im just idly cleaning and watching for a rare potential customer a guy comes in and seemed like a really typical gas station customer kinda guy early sish short big tattoos iron maiden tshirt the works he comes up and i take the first part of his order i ask him how his day is going just to ease the silence while im working on his food he says its goin good and i put his sandwich in the oven as i turn away from the oven and back to him he says actually its goin damn great yeah im at least a little interested at this point he didnt seem like a talkative man yeah man i met a girl a couple of days ago and weve really hit it off were all talkin and shit and she seems to like hanging out all the time as hes saying this he is slowly turning from permascowl to a weirdly boyish smile he starts telling me about her hair and how she laughs all in a really surprisingly innocent way i wrap up his food and start the register when he leans towards me with his hands out the best part is she has some just massive boobs and holds his hands apart in front of him to demonstrate at that point he looks at me and realizes hes telling the sandwich guy about his love life over a sandwich for the last five minutes we both start laughing and i hand him his sandwich and tell him im happy for him he looks at me and apologizes saying sorry man i just feel awesome and i had to tell someone made my day

i havent worked retail in a while but i recently started at a beauty supply store most customers have been really cool until yesterday im new so im still learning all the ins and outs of the massive amount of beauty supplies we sell this girl walks in an hands me a list ill call her beauty school dropout or bsd the list is for supplies for a beauty class shes taking ok this will probably be easy i can gather things from a list right maybe not nothing is labeled it just lists things like curlers well we have a lot of curlers which kind do she need of course she doesnt know but does she listen to my pitch for each item and make an informed decision no just sighs that i dont now which exact curler her teacher wanted then there is a type of bobby pin listed but i didnt recognize the name me do you know what it looks like bsd i dont know the name of it in english me well maybe you could take a look at the selection and see if you recognize it bsd but i dont know the name of it in english me okwell maybe you could google the name you do know on your phone and show me a picture bsd but i dont know the name of it in english me another woman asks for my help when im free no rush though surprisingly bsd kindly offers that i help the other lady first so i go over and start to help her find a new curling iron bsd stands behind us the whole time tapping her foot looking impatient and sighing the curling iron lady felt so bad she just bought the first one i handed to her to get out of bsds way as soon as i turn back to help bsd she asks is there anyone else here who might know what theyre talking about who can help me i gladly pass her off to my manager i come back later as shes checking out apparently shes taken multiple brushes we have from behind the counter that cost by the way and examined them and tried to use them in her hair which we had to practically jump her to stop her from doing then she drops the bomb bsd i dont know why they let any of you work here youre clearly not very good stylists then strolls out we all just laughed because shockingly we arent all trained stylists who choose to work minimum wage retail positions just for fun 
i have recently lost a chunk of weight about of my starting weight i have changed my body shape quite dramatically as you can imagine my gym partner is a very well toned athletic female who crossfits she also loves paleo just so you understand i gym i obstacle race i still carry a bit of weight she grew up in italy and has a competent grasp on the italian language where i know as much as mario and luigi and occasional bolognaise sauce advertisement i am heading out to dinner this weekend with friends so i task my gym buddy to aid me choosing a new outfit not only am i a male i am an engineer clothes for me are functional i am in desperate need of a queer eye or someone who understands fashion hence the tasking of said female friend we are in the local jeans shop i am squeezing into jeans not only in cuts that i never thought were possible but sizes which i never would have thought i would wear since primary school as i am trying on a pair of jeans i hear two guys in the changerooms just up from me spark up a conversation the most i can gather is they want to speak only in italian not in english after that i lose track of what they are saying at the moment i walk out of the changerooms for an opinion my friend turns to them says something vicious and rapid in italian these two guys turn bright red turn put down their potential purchases and slowly start backing out of the changerooms and shops entirely after watching this whole debacle and after they left i turn to my friend and give the biggest wtf look i have it turns out they started ragging on me from the moment i entered and culminated in the sentence what does a guy like him think he should be doing in public with a lady like her this is when she decides to pipe in with do you realise i understand everything you just said thank you and fuck you i couldnt stop laughing the two floor staff came to see if i was ok and we relayed the story to them and they then told us they couldnt understand why these two guys left in such a hurry we had a good laugh for about minutes i made my purchase and we left

edit scroll down for the story a lot of you are asking the same great questions and i realized that when i posted this at in the morning i did a poor job of explaining why i was upset at this girl so let me answer the questions getting asked the most but first thank you to drunkenblackbelt i have a friend who is bipolar and he insists that theres something wrong with him i disagree completely i understand that sometimes the chemicals in someones brain are off but thats not something the person can help and its not their fault they can be medicated but thats a whole other issue in itself and sometimes the medications dont help or make it worse i cant imagine how difficult it is to have your brain fight you on a daily basis the reason i was so upset with this girl is because she copied my entire business down to the setup she has no sign for her business and doesnt leave cards out on her table because her setup is the exact replica of mine people think she is part of my business which does have signs and cards on the table this is what upsets me for several reasons one if were being honest the girl cant sew for shit which is why i wouldnt hire her her lines are all over the place and she uses white thread for everything so you can always see the thread its a pet peeve of mine she also picks out either plain fabrics of cheap flower printed ones that dont tend to sell and i dont want people thinking that im turning out that quality of work it sounds mean i know and im not trying to be mean i used to work with my aunt who was a tailor so i have a strong background in sewing and i dont want people thinking im haphazardly sewing things with bad lines and poor workmanship im afraid that people are going to continue to think shes associated with me and it will hurt my business i believe i sell better because i carry a better quality of fabrics and i have a background in sewing so my sewing is neater maybe not necessarily better but visually neater than hers i also want to be known for quality items and quality fabric and i feel like with her not separately identifying herself from me that people will continue to think she is part of my business and it will reflect poorly on me why she doesnt have her own signage i dont know i have in fact wondered if she does it purposely to try to gain some of my business i have tried to talk to her and she was very flippant about it going as far as to tell me i stole her ideas i was in business three years before her so that and a few other conversations with her made me believe she does know what shes doing but she treats me like i should just get over it and be okay with it because she can do whatever she wants you really wouldnt outwardly know she was schizophrenic so her medications seems to be stabilizing her at least enough that you wouldnt readily notice but she acts extremely entitled and thats what gets me about the situation also as far as her pet photography i heard that she doesnt do it anymore because she wasnt showing up for appointments and such this wouldnt surprise me because she hasnt shown up for several vendor shows i know she was supposed to be at people were asking me where she was because for some reason because of her set up pricing etc people think shes a part of my business or a side business to mine i dont want her ruining the reputation i worked hard to build she essentially stole my entire business model and not just my ideas because i understand the ideas are not subject to copyright and shes welcome to make the same things as me i see her as a liability more than competition story time a lot of you have been asking for the story of the girl who copied my entire business i want to start off by saying that i will be brutally honest when telling this story because theres a lot of layers to this that i feel are important for all of you to know to this day i still dont know if i should feel bad for her or just be really ticked off i was doing a farmers market at the beginning of summer last year farmers markets as ive learned seem to be where trouble is my partner had gotten up to walk around and then came back to the booth and told me that there was another girl clear at the other side of the market that did pet photography and had a few bandanas she said she had spent some time talking to the girl who we will call a just because its the first letter of the alphabet and i was watching pretty little liars earlier like a teenager and that she was so genuinely kind she wanted us talk because she seemed interested in finding someone who could dress the dogs she photographed this isnt a rare thing that happens ive done multiple shows where i was approached by pet photographers who wanted to purchase some of my items to have on hand to offer to people for photoshoots because people will often want to dress up their dog and assume the photographer works like a childrens photographer who has clothing options and different props to dress up the shoot on hand i always work with them so that they could get a variety of items or let them photograph the booth and offer people a few options from those photos and then contact me later to buy certain items no problem i enjoy doing it and every so often one of those photographers is amazing and will post the pictures online or the photos will make it into a local community paper i went down and talked to a extensively she was very sweet and looked familiar but i couldnt place her she had maybe ten dog bandanas totally different than mine in two sizes only at a totally different price point than mine and the rest of her table was just photography she didnt have a tent or a whole booth she just simply had one table without a tablecloth she said this wasnt something she wanted to do and she just brought a few bandanas with her to help make up the money she spent on the table but she didnt enjoy sewing or crafting she just wanted to get the word out about her photography business now ive been to a lot dog events and ive seen a lot of professional dog photographers who have been doing this for several years she was a self proclaimed amateur with a love for pet photography and her photography is just stunning shes extremely talented regardless of how i feel about her ripping off my business she is an extremely talented photographer if i wasnt a bit ticked at her i would hire her to photograph my pets in a heartbeat a came down to my booth a little later and did the normal may i take some pictures of your booth to show my clients different options of what i can get for them to dress their pets in she gave the reason that she realized all the work that went into making bandanas and she just didnt want to put the effort in she would rather buy some items to have on hand and seemed particularly interested in the ties and bow ties ive heard this before too so i said yes and never thought anything of it i had really enjoyed talking to her she seemed very sweet and this was a seminormal thing to happen so that was that imagine my surprise when not quite two months later i showed up to a dog event to find her with literally every single thing i made made exactly the same way with the same set up down to using peg boards as bow tie displays and mini blackboards to price items to suddenly having multiple size bandanas and everything was the same price as mine she also gained a tent and three tables with tablecloths just like mine oh and she doesnt do pet photography anymore i was floored i can understand taking inspiration from someone but this was flat out copying my business up until this point i was the only person in the area that had a business even remotely like this everyone did bandanas but they were slightly higher priced than mine because i liked to be a little competitive and fair with my pricing and no one else carried bow ties ties and some of the other things i had i was the only so called handmade full service pet vendor so this was obviously extremely upsetting to me to make it worse she lives ten minutes from me so were selling to the exact same area theres nothing i can do about it because i cant prove she took pictures in my booth that day even though i can prove that my business started before hers but is it worth trying to sue her over this probably not and it will just get me a bad name in the vendor community so its not worth it after she set up she had the gall to come over and talk to me like she didnt just copy my entire business through the pictures she had taken of my booth she even went as far as to ask me if i remembered her i really felt like she thought she was complimenting me by copying me then she picked up one of my dog toys that i didnt have at the farmers market and asked me how i made it i kid you not i politely pulled it from her hand and asked her to not come back in my booth which she didnt at the end of the show after we were packed up she did come over and complain to me that she did horrible at the show and didnt make her table the show was one of the best shows i did but i wasnt going to tell her that i just nodded sympathetically and went about my day this was also coincidentally the show where the dog ate my hamburger that was a weird day friends in the time since ive found out theres a few things that set us apart i will buy the more expensive dog print fabrics she will only buy generic fabrics that are on sale or clearance little things like that i do have a leg up on her in the form that ive been doing this longer and know what sells and what doesnt but also because even if she sees the more expensive fabric selling she refuses to buy anything over a yard so thats an advantage to me the other advantage is that im already signed up for several of the good shows in the area and i resign up every single year in that period where they give past vendors a chance to sign up first these shows are all one vendor per type of item so all the shows she wants into she cant get into and i dont have to worry about her copying more of my ideas at them she even once asked me if i could not do the one show last year so she could get in that blew my mind i had already signed up and paid for it and was essentially the vendor in her way so that ended that because the show didnt give refunds however she did start out not putting interfacing in her ties because that was something she couldnt tell i did from a photograph as soon as she realized i did it she started doing it too and advertising it like she was the only one in the world to do it i learned fairly quickly that she was stalking my business facebook page and that every single time i would post something she would immediately copy it and then try to show it to me at a show i ended up banning her from my business facebook page so that seemed to stop that nonsense with the way she handled things and how bold she was to ask me how i made stuff not to do a show so she could etc i used to say to my business partner what is wrong with her because that seemed like off behavior to me one thing i did know about her from talking to her is that she would get a job keep it for a few months no longer work there and have to get a new job i noticed with vendor shows that she would disappear for a month or two and then show back up and say she was working during those months she was missing so she seems to only do the business when shes not working also kind of odd because the people i know either have a business or dont long story short what i did find out when she tried to friend me on facebook i rejected it because reasons is that we went to high school together she was my age and a lot of my friends knew her hence why she looked so familiar that day at the farmers market i explained the situation and asked a few really good friends who we had in common but i had known since childhood and was still really close about her just out of curiosity all of them said that they dont talk to her really but from being her facebook friend and having graduated with her i was pulled out of school during my first year of high school because i got incredibly ill and had to be homeschooled so what happened in high school after that is news to me which is why i inquired they know that she is schizophrenic and on medication her parents pay for all of her stuff including her apartment and the guy that comes with her to shows that we thought was her boyfriend is basically her caretaker the stipulation of her parents paying for everything is that she has to work but every few months she seems to lose jobs which lines up with what ive gotten from her in conversation she has trouble getting hired again because the place where she worked wont give her a good reference so she makes and sales dog stuff in between working so that her parents dont get mad at her in retrospect i feel bad thinking something was wrong with her schizophrenia isnt something thats wrong with a person or something that they can help and i applaud her for starting her own business making her own stuff and trying to work i really do which is why i feel so bad about being mad at her if i would have known all of this and she would have come to me and said she also wanted to make dog items but didnt know how i would have sat down and helped her come up with items and patterns specific to her brand im just that kind of person and i appreciate when people are upfront i am literally willing to help anyone if they are honest with me i did this with a friend of mine who needed extra income and didnt know how to craft theres tons of things she could have done that wouldnt have interfered with what i was doing and she could have formed a brand around but for her to just steal everything down to my set up and steal my brand out from under me that gets the big old huh uh girlfriend edit for tldr met a girl at a farmers market claiming to be a photographer she asked to take pictures of my stuff which is normal photographer fanfare then she copied my entire business down to my pricing my items and my set up 
im an assistant manager at a chain apparel store ampnbsp last night i was called up to the register to help deal with an irate customer who wanted to use multiple coupons at once our systems only allow for two coupon codes at once but typically we do what we can to use three or four at once sometimes it requires splitting the transaction and sometimes we can just do some overriding to make it work either way its technically against strict policy to do this but well we arent exactly in the business to make people unhappy ampnbsp so this customer had three coupons one to redeem for a free gift one a reward from our brand credit card and one coupon given out from a store for an inconvenience we had to scan in the gift code and we wanted to scan the reward to ensure that if returns were made the value was returned the third my cashier wanted to simply override a few items for its total value but the customer wasnt having it ampnbsp me hey cashiers name whats going on cashier well we wanted to use coupons and customer who ill be calling b from now on he wanted to use my coupon some weird way so that i lose out on my money me okay which coupons do we have here my cashier showed me the coupons and explained his plan its exactly what i would have done me well thats the general process that id use if you want i can split the transaction and just use the code for your free gift on that b now why do you people make it so difficult dont do my coupon like that me which coupon maam b youre going to use my and just take it off so that i lose it if i have to make a return the customer always gets screwed me maam its a coupon if we use it normally it takes and distributes an equal part of it to each item in your transaction its money that you arent paying so you arent losing it if you make a return b thats stupid why cant it just take it off the transaction total me thats in effect what it does though b store name is so greedy god just do what you want me i understand that it can be a little frustrating well be taking off from your most expensive items to use your coupon thats money you are not paying so youre right you cant get it back either ampnbsp i was starting to get irritated at this point ampnbsp b what about my rewards then im sure youll keep those too me if you make a return your reward coupon will be returned to your card in the form of the points you used to redeem it that way if you return of your transaction youll get exactly half of your reward points back too b yeah right thats what they say companies must spend so much time figuring out ways to screw me over me youre okay then cashier ill be over here if you need me again ampnbsp i walked away she left still fuming a few minutes later i sent my cashier away to do something in the back so he could have some time away from the sales floor ampnbsp it seems like every time we try to help a customer out and go above and beyond it farts on our faces i think from now on well hold to company policy because honestly if theyre going to be calling corporate because theyre pissed off id rather it be because we held to policy than because we tried to adlib it ampnbsp its just sad because the nice customers are really the ones who get screwed because of jokers like this
many many moons ago during college i had a crappy job at a nowmostlydefunct franchise coffee chain store the shop was owned by a husbandwife team well call them bill and nancy richman not their real names of course i was hired in the late summer before their store opened for business and had developed a good relationship with them over the next few months i even babysat their two children on occassions when their nanny had the night off they trusted me to come to their house and inventory orders in their garage when they werent around but this story isnt about their kids or their garage i had been working at the store for about months and it was now late spring my college semester was about to end my time at the store would be ending soon as well the richmans were aware that one of the reasons that i slaved away for them was that i was saving up as much money as i could for a summer trip to europe and i would be quitting the job before departure day so it was a few weeks from dday that bill asked me to come in to the store on a saturday to spend my shift cleaning out the very tiny and always extremely cluttered stock room to make room for a big shipment coming in later in the week he expressly told me to wear grungy clothes as opposed to the franchiserequired uniform as id be making lots of trips out to the dumpsters as well as degrossifying some neglected areas and would not be helping customers that day it was an uncostumary and therefore highly memorable offer as bill and nancy were pretty strict about employee appearances i arrived for my shift that saturday wearing jeans and an old tshirt looking for the cleaning supplies i was told that nancy had brought in that morning for me to use little did i or anybody else know it was on that very day the owners of the parent company also a husband and wife team would decide to pop in to the shop for a little surprise visit their first ever to that store i found out later this is what happened moments after the high lord and lady of coffeedom set their eyes on me in furious whispers to the richmans the company owners demanded to know why i had arrived to work not wearing the companyimagepromoting dress code bill professed to not have a clue why i would show up to work that way nancy remarked what could spaetzele have been thinking thrown right under the bus the company owners demanded that i be fired on the spot for the offense and standup people that they were bill and nancy stood by me and refused to do it because i was a loyal employee who had always worked hard for them since the day they had opened and by the way i had been told to dress exactly that way by them no wait sorry that didnt happen what actually happened was that they told the owners that they too couldnt tolerate my unexplained outofuniformness and pledged i would be fired that very day being the honorable people they were they actually passed off the task of firing me to the store manager i suppose so they wouldnt ever have my wtf face burned into their brains for all eternity to recap so far told to work out of uniform by bosses bosses get caught by corporate i am betrayed and fired the story doesnt end here though having just found out i was fired for an absolutely ridiculous and frankly totally lazy and insulting reason my first instinct was to get pissed throw my apron in their faces and give them my best double salute as i marched out the door but my second instinct waswell i really do need that next pay check before i go on my trip and hell everyone knows i was going to quit anyway so i proposed to the manager that i just work the remainder of the couple of weeks as originally intended she got the ok from the richmans who i now could not even look in the face without fantasizing about throwing hot coffee at them and i worked until the week before i was due to fly away my last shift finally comes a closing shift right before we were about to lock the stores door behind us for the night the telephone rang the other employee i was working with a good friend answered it and handed over the reciever telling me it was bill and he wanted to talk to me i dont want to talk to bill i just want to go home i said thinking he was going to give me some drippy goodbye speech but the truth was i was that once i saw the richmans true colors i was glad to see the back of them and didnt feel the need to pretend we were parting on friendly terms just take it so we can get out of here my friend said so i took the telephone and said yes bill hey spaetzele said bill in a nauseatingly singsongy voice i just wanted to wish you well on your trip and ask you if youll be coming to back to work with us when you return i blinked i gave my friend my best is this shit for real face i cleared my throat and replied well no bill i am not coming back to the store that is not the plan bill shocked asked but why not you cant just leave us well miss you gag controlling rage i didnt know it was even possible to feel i told bill bill you know exactly why you fired me today is my last day of work and i am never going to come back here bill oh cmon you know click i hung up on him turned off the light locked the door and had an awesome trip tldr got told to wear clothes to clean in got fired for doing what i was asked boss attempted to unfire me on my last day fuck that shit

i work as a fill manager at a grocery store in australia one day i am kneeling on the floor hastily stuff cartons into the lower shelf an elderly chinese lady arrives holding an empty box and tries to get my attention i ask her if i could help her and she points at the box and makes a psshh sound she obviously doesnt speak english so i try to communicate to her through mime i assume she wants the item that would have been in the box but not she mimes again the box the psshh then the points to her knee and says owe its all clicking through my head until she then points to my knees owe she wants me to kneel on the cardboard so that i dont hurt my knees i feel sad that so few people care that the worlds servants feel pain and misery like everybody else but happy that every so often you run into somebody who treats you like a human being
so heres a story from my time at overrated canadian coffee shop that i was reminded of from a previous story today when i worked there i was the only male to work the counter in the general area that encompassed a dozen stores seeing the girls get hit on by creepy guys was a daily occurrence and most of them laughed about it and so did i eventually so this day it was a hot afternoon in july and the store was sweltering company policy said that we had to keep all the buttons done up right to the throat where it was so hot our manager gave us permission to waive the policy that day and unbutton the top button of our uniform i was working the window taking money and passing out drinks seriously who the fuck gets coffee in the middle of a heat wave one guy comes to the window gets his coffee and pays with a bill i pass him his change about and he tells me to keep it puzzled i tell him how much it is he says thats fine and drives off i shrug my shoulders put it in the tip jar and tell the girls they giggle and we move on to the next customer over the course of the next hours he comes through more times leaving his change each time after the last time my supervisor looks at me laughs and tells me to unbutton the next button to see if i can get a bigger tip from him or at least his phone number tl dr got hit on by a gay guy that everyone knew was gay except me
background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of july and new years eve story fireworks are supposed to be exciting and fun and i want my customers to have that same experience when they shop at my store i try very hard to make sure that every person leaves my store with a smile on their face this is the story of someone who did not during the rush this past th my so grabbed me and told me that we had a customer who was very upset i dropped what i was doing and followed her i immediately recognized the guy as one of our regulars who spends a lot of money hes an older gentleman probably in his mids and he had always been reasonably nice when i had previously helped him he was standing just outside of the tent with his shopping cart and he was obviously pissed off as soon as he saw me the profanity filled tirade started it was loud and obscene enough that i noticed that people within of us were turning around to watch as he is going off one of my cashiers and my so walk up behind me apparently one of our credit card machines was not working properly when he was trying to make a purchase the cashier had swiped his card three separate times and he was convinced that he was going to be charged three times the cashier kept trying to explain to him that it wasnt taking the card and that she had only put in the charge amount one time so it wouldnt charge him three times my so tries to tell him that she can quickly run a report to make sure that he wasnt charged three times he keeps interrupting both of them to tell them that theyre wrong and that he doesnt have time for them to run a report in the meantime hes now spent minutes standing in the parking lot spewing obscenities i kept trying to interject and defuse the situation but he refused to stop screaming and just shouted over me every time i tried to talk to him a few of the priceless gems that i remember gtguy i see how you run a fucking business your cashier was rude to me and never apologized gt gtguy if you people knew what the fuck you were doing we wouldnt be standing here gt gtguy i spend a lot of money here but im never coming back here again if this is the way you treat your good customers gt gtguy now i have to take the time to call my credit card company to dispute your fucking charges gt gtguy im going to call the radio station where i advertise and let them know what a piece of shit place this is gt gtguy im going to sue you for wasting my time during this entire tirade im continually trying to talk to him but he just keeps shouting over me remember that scene in national lampoons vacation where clark loses it yeah thats pretty much what happened to me gtme yelling even louder than him if you would just shut the fuck up for a second maybe i could help you he was stunned he just looked at me for a second and then said what are you going to do i walked inside the tent grabbed an item similar to what he had in his cart then walked back out and handed it to him gtme still yelling have a nice day i then turned around and walked back into the tent ill be honest when i first went back into the tent i was planning to grab cash from the register to refund his money hand him the cash take back the firework from his cart and tell him to get the fuck out in a split second i decided to take the high road im still on the fence as to whether i made the right decision i did go back afterward and verify that we only charged him one time i can tell you one thing if he comes back this year hes going to have to apologize to my entire staff before i sell him anything i dont care how much money he spends edit i should also mention that i was embarrassed by my behavior i still cant believe i snapped i think part of it was that the guy yelling and cussing at my so as well i dont tolerate men yelling at women very well and yelling at my so even less if youre interested ive posted a few other stories 
i came into work particularly grumpy today so on my lunch break i decided to overdose on caffeine i worked drive thru on the dinner rush and i was all smiles and bouncing off the walls with positivity really trying to give it my best then i took an order from a clearly passive aggressive old lady i tried to kill her with kindness all the while i anticipated she would complain about something was she going to complain about the price was she going to say her food was too cold was she going to complain about the wait time i kept trying to guess what she would try to pull but she didnt say anything she just had this hard frown on her face and spoke with a fearsome growl i got through the whole transaction without issue and i was convinced i had avoided a complaint but at the very end before she drove away she shoots me this death glare and says gt you really need to calm down young man nobody should be that happy while there is so much suffering in the world of all the things i was anticipating she would say that was not one of them so i just kind of had this blank stare on my face as she drove away of course a minute later i figured i could have replied with smiles are part of the uniform maam have a nice day but it was too late so i guess she won that round edit thank you for the gold you have brought me a smile 
phone rings me thank you for calling store how may i help you customer c what time do you close me we close at exactly c if i get there at will you be able to help me unfortunately not we close at and our system will be shut down for the night c but why cant you help me m because well be closed c but competitor stays open later why wont you help me me because well be closed c hangs up
i work at the service desk at a grocery store which has a gas station in the parking lot it is the service desk job to relieve the people running it for their breaks and lunches so normally i spend about an hour a day out there i could go on forever about the crazy things i have seen people do or things i have been yelled at for but this one takes the cake it took place a few years ago but ill tell it as best i can it was just an average day and i was out at fuel to relieve a lunch i look up from my phone and see a woman fast approaching she looks pissed i greet her through the intercom and ask how i can help her lets call her dumb broad because thats what she was dumb broad i believe i just filled my car up with diesel but i know i selected unleaded the price is higher and i want a refund i did not select diesel now at this point i should mention i was exhausted and didnt even want to put up with her much less try and figure out how she accidentally filled her car with diesel me um okay im sorry that happened well i cant refund that out here without approval but if you would like to go inside and talk to a manager they might be able to help you out she huffs and puffs and walks back to her car to drive it closer to the store now again i was exhausted and didnt even think to tell her that probably wasnt the best idea to even start the car but thats what she gets for being an idiot shortly after my coworker returns from lunch and i head back into the store when i walk in i see the dumb broad standing at the counter talking to a manager she sees me walk in and points dumb broad she told me you guys would refund it for me she said she couldnt but you would manager did you tell her that me no i said you guys might be able to help her but thats it manager face lights up wait a second isnt the handle for diesel entirely its own on the opposite side of the pump and bright green me why yes yes it is now that you mention it manager and isnt the nozzle that goes into the tank bigger so that it doesnt fit into nondiesel vehicles also yes i hadnt thought of either of these things now dumb broad seems extra dumb and im trying not to giggle manager so how exactly did you manage to fill up without realizing that the handle was bright green and labeled diesel and that the nozzle didnt fit in your car dumb broad well i held the handle outside of the tank the whole time and let the gas run in because i wasnt sure why it didnt fit this is ridiculous and i just want a refund manager okay well this is not our fault in the slightest seeing as were multiple warnings that you were using the incorrect nozzle i suggest you call a tow truck to go get your tank drained because if you try to drive your car it is going to break down have a nice day the look on this ladys face was amazing she used our phone to call for a tow truck and ended up waiting almost hours for someone to come get her tldr dont be oblivious to what you are doing or you will not only be humiliated but also have a pretty penny to pay for it
how do you know when someone frequents a porno palace too much when the police show up at the smut hut with a warrant on the person trying to locate him you could try going to family you could try going to friends naw you just go down to the local dildo ranch because the guy is known to be there all the time sadly luckily he wasnt at the whack shack when they came that time i have not seen him in a bit so im guessing they managed to track him down

at the moment the supermarket that i work at is having a sale on toilet paper it is a pretty big saving half price off one of the more premium brands making it a good deal there are rolls to the packet so the limit of per customer shouldnt be too much of a problem i mean rolls of toilet paper will last you a while anyway my story begins with a middle aged man lets call him angry customer or ac who came in and went straight to the toilet paper display area and loaded his trolley shopping cart with as many packs that he could fit totally disregarding the limit per customer sign that was next to the price in the catalogue and even taped onto some of the packs of toilet paper that he had put into his trolley i noticed him line up at one of the checkouts and as i was supervising i thought i would politely tell him about the limit before he gets to the front of the line and hold things up me excuse me sir but we have a limit of packs of toilet paper per customer sorry ac no thats okay ill just take these he smirks at me me sorry but you have packs in your trolley but we can only sell you ac what why this is the special for this week me yes i know that however in order for all customers to have a chance at buying a i was cut off ac it was in the catalogue and advertised on tv so you have to sell them to me me it was also advertised as having a limit of per customer we will gladly sell you packs but that is all at this point it is his turn to be served and he turns away from me and hands the cashier one pack telling her that he has in total that he will pay for i then interrupted me excuse me sir but like i said we can not sell you more than packs ac am i talking to you just let me pay and piss off at this point i didnt even bother replying and the cashier had stopped scanning after the rd pack and we all just stood there waiting for him to either pay or leave he then proceeded to take out the extra packs that we wouldnt sell to him and toss them on the floor and then told me that i was a smartass do you want to know what the worst part about this is basically the same thing happens at least once a shift where i inform customers of the limit i guess the only positive is that im becoming immune to the idiotic comments they make about me to try and make themselves feel better after being called out on their shit tldr customer doesnt want to understand the concept of limit per customer
 years ago a customer wanted a discount on a lunch bag that was allegedly missing an item the tag stated reusable lunch container the customer interpretation was an extra container was included with the lunch bag after politely informing her she was wrong and showed her the rest of them didnt include extra items she called me a fat grinch i never forgot her or her horrible cankle tattoo between then and now i was transferred and promoted i also shaved my head and lost about pounds day ago said customer happened to apply for a job at my location i did not know it was her based on the name however once seeing her and her tattoo she wore denim capris i knew it was her i do not think she initially remembered me or the incident towards the end of the interview we talked about handling tough situations i asked her how she would handle a customer making remarks about their personal appearance the light bulb came on and she remembered me after thanking her for her time she was on her way out looking at her app she had been unemployed for years it felt so good rejecting that candidate and for legal reason i rejected her based on appearance and not making eye contact edit she kinda looled like the girl on the right but with a pixie cut 
not a super awful story but irritating just the same i worked in a departmenttype store last summer like most department stores we sold some candy caramel corn and stuff at the front register but no actual food like meals or anything this one lady comes up to me at the register and asks if we sell lunch i say no and she asks where she could get it theres a wendys and a panda express across the street as well as a few local stores so i name those she shakes her head and says no i want lunch i then name a fewer high end places nearby thinking she wants a good nice lunch she then yells no i want lunch and pantomimes holding a bag alunchbox i ask she then yells yes thats what she wanted and is confused as to why i would think she wanted lunch i tell her no we dont sell those and she huffs and says you dont sell lunch im sorry for thinking that you meant lunch when you said lunch
i work at a rising chain of supermarkets in the uk have done for a year around february we hired a new girl finally we have sacked her and its not a moment too soon there were many things that she could have been sacked for as she never made it out of the probation period but this was the final one most of this is second hand knowledge as i want there im in on an early shift from till pm not keen on those shifts for several reasons but whatever i was doing it ngnew girl is meant to be in at and would take over the primary checkout from me doesnt turn up till and as we were short staffed i stayed an extra half hour as we were unable to take my till and cash it up due to the safe key changing hands at roughly the same time basically everyone was annoyed with her at this point and if id not already gone home when she arrived id have had a go at her she turns up in a bad mood already the duty managera woman in her s shes really nice and doesnt lose her temper with anyone pleasure to work with tells her to go on the primary checkout she refuses dm tells her again to do it ng says fine but these customers are going to fucking get it today im not in the mood another colleague was also in the room at this point so could verify this i dont have a problem with people getting annoyed and saying things about customers when theyre not there but given how she acted its relevant she goes out and is apparently clearly sulking but doing her job until she gets to a customer with a lot of fresh fruit and vegetablesshes being quite careless with itwhile i wasnt there this is standard shes careless in general and she probably bruised some apples and other fruit he tells her to be more careful she sulks and says nothing to him in return or for the rest of the transaction other than to say the cost he hands over the money she throws the change across the checkout at him claims she dropped it but again another coworker can verify shes lying customer complains and is asked if hell write a statement for uswe want rid of ng while the colleague who saw this all happen also writes one on the day of her disciplinary she comes in accuses dm and other colleague of lying and the customer uses a statement from her mother saying she wouldnt do that as a defence and threatens to sue the shop for wrongful dismissal never seen the rest of the staff so happy i shouldnt be happy to see someone fired but she deserves it ive posted before about her and why shes a bad employee tldr being awful at your job tends to end in losing your job edit top of tfr wow did not expect this just a note theres much more to why shes a bad employee this is just the tale of her firing
howdy tfr second post i work at an entertainment park a given customer will walk through the front door up to the front desk pay for wristbands and enter the park we get dozens of people an hour and we bring in stupid amounts of money because of this we do hourly cash drops and therefore cannot accept bills larger than we even have a fancy little sign taped to the surface of the front desk that says so saturday afternoon busiest time of the week sixty person line out the door scraggly dad gets to the front with his child and we exchange the usual back and forth his total comes out to something like dollars and he drops a crumpled benjamin on the counter mesorry sir we cannot accept bills larger than sdyoure kidding me right you people bring in thousands of dollars every day and you cant take a hundred mei really cant take it its just policy sdno youll take my hundred i know you have change just give me my wristband and my change pushes hundred closer meunfortunately due to our volume of income we have to drop register into the safe every hour i couldnt break your even if there wasnt a policy sdlook kid im yo dude was he had to sign a waiver and i saw his birthday you have to break my hundred you dont have a sign and i know you have change reaches for wristband that i pulled out beforehand i pull it back and he slams his palm on the table mesir as you can see here point to his hand which is covering the sign we cannot accept your dollar bill it is policy clearly stated if you cannot pay then youll have to step out of line sd then sighs a big fat sigh his cute little kid is completely oblivious and pulling on sds pant leg to get into the park poor little guy but wait sd turns to the massive line of impatient people and yells at the top of his lungs can anyone here break a freakin dollar bill his voice cracked and his son started crying everyone in line silently gives him one of and sd finally grabs his grabs his wailing kids wrist and leaves the park while i was happy the dude left and of course i felt bad for the kid this is nowhere near any of the crazier parents that elicit our condolences still what a rude guy edit didnt expect so much attention let me clarify some things a the dude must have eventually returned with change because i saw him and his kid half an hour later in the park i didnt check him in b it was dollars for him and dollars for his kid c as most of you can figure out for yourselves i dont make the freakin policy i personally have no issues with taking a hundred dollar bill usually we have enough change in the drawer at the time i did not and we have those counterfeit detecting pens but its not my policy i cant do it some think its terrible i personally think its a good idea i wouldnt want to lose thousands of dollars if my business was robbed so drop your cash if you sometimes cant break hundreds because of that just dont take s less to worry about d depending on the gm who is working with us behind the desk we can take s if its a slow day and the total is more than this instance was neither of those things e people keep saying i am a jerk for the way i handled this guy i get that but where i work you follow policy strictly or youre fired and after hours of screaming children rude parents and dozens of birthday parties i am in no mood to give special treatment to one stubborn angry guy edit also for those saying i should get a manager which customers ask for as well the manager is usually in his office on the other side of the park and hardly answers his phone i know its inefficient but i just work there also the manager is just going to follow his policy thats how it is most places like this its occasionaly a hassle for customers but usually it just makes everyones life easier
i work at a large retail store that you have probably been to i work in the produce department so that means i get to stock fruit and vegetables and fun things like that anyways yesterday i was working and it was a busy day for a sunday i live in a religious area where not many people go do stuff on sundays the entire day people had been ruder than usual i usually have no problems with my job everyone is nice and i enjoy being nice to people and helping people out when they have questions but it seemed that yesterday everyone was grumpy for some reason nothing big enough to make a post solely about that but grumpier than usual i was stocking some cucumbers when someone touched my shoulder and said excuse me young man right when i heard this i got a little nervous because ive learned in my time on the job that when someone is going to be especially rude its an elderly man i turned around and put on my smile and said yes how can i help you i was expecting a rude tone about something because his face seemed a little distressed but instead he smiled as well and said do you have any corn there isnt any in the bin its usually kept in i realized that i had been stocking everything else but somehow in the rush of the day i had forgotten to stock the corn and now it was empty causing a misfortune for a lot of customers im sorry sir ill hurry and get the corn from the back i know we have some back there and i rushed off to get the corn when i got back i began to stock the corn the old man stayed around though and began to have a conversation with me he was a very nice old man and asked how long id been working at where i worked at how the day was going if my boss was working me hard it was nice to actually have a person kind of appreciate what i was doing instead of acting like i was their slave as i finished stocking the corn and went back to my other tasks i said to him im sorry i didnt have the corn stocked originally that was my fault he said dont worry about it even if you didnt have any corn there are more important things in life than corn the old mans conversation made me happy the rest of the day i wish that every person who gives me a glare or mutters something under their breath whenever i say were out of something would understand that there are more important things in life than item and that being rude isnt going to get them what they want tldr old guy makes me happy
so i work in a convenience store and on a daily basis i have to deal with lottery addicts and alcoholics some of these people are terrible others are okay and some are my favorite people in the world i was dealing with a guys lottery numbers and he plays probably or tickets that i have to scan and send a third of the way through or people walk in to the store which is kind of a lot for us as we are small i usually try and take care of the person i have first then move on to the beer and cigarette people because that is quicker so as im taking care of lotto guy this rude alcoholic man child walks up and slams his bottle of watered down vodka on the counter waits seconds and says fucking lottery people there are people around all waiting patiently for their various purchases and the lotto guy i was working on was being very kind so i stop everything and say excuse me sir you can either wait hate patiently like an adult or you can wait like a child and get out of here he was taken aback and he slurred ill wait im patient i finished up with lotto guy and then took care of the boozed up baby he left and then all the i other people in the store started laughing their asses off one woman who plays lottery there told me she was glad i said something because she was about to jump on his back it was a good day for this minimum wage worker tldr i made a drunk old man apologize like a child for being impatient
i used to be an assistant manager at a food service establishment that was a national chain against my recommendation my general manager hired one of our employees boyfriendfianceehusband what he was depended on who she was lying to at the time to be a baker after we hired him we noticed food would go missing and that the freezer was starting to smell a lot like marijuana im not talking about a little food it would be whole turkeys and hams needless to say we watched the videos and fired him for various reasons stealing violation of drug policy apparently in state it is required that when an employee is fired that their last paycheck has to be issued and mailed within days of termination on the rd day after the termination the exemployee calls and demands that i give him his paycheck i informed him that his check would not be coming to the restaurant but would be mailed to his address that we had on file i then provided him with the number for our corporate payroll department that he could call if he had questions in a huff he hung up on me a while later he called me back and told me that they claimed to have mailed the check the day before and he should be expecting it anytime apparently this was not good enough for him and he wanted his check that day and started to get belligerent on the phone at this point i got another manager into the office and put him on speakerphone so that they could hear after a while he informed me that if he didnt have his paycheck by the end of the day that he would be coming to the restaurant to get his money by force and would be suing me personally for not providing his compensation within the legal timeframe i politely asked him when he considered end of business for the day and when we should expect him after he hung up the phone i called the police and informed them of the situation promptly at the specified time the first time he had been on time for anything related to his job he arrived with a baseball bat and demanded his money the police who were sitting in the dining room stood up and arrested him for assault i dont know what he expected to get out of me seeing as i had no authority to give him money from the safe or registers and was not liable legally for the situation at all the funny thing is that his mail was delayed that day and according to his femaleperson his check arrived hours after he got arrested i pressed charges and since he had a record he went away for several years he should be able to go cash that check here in about a year and a half too bad he will need to call payroll to get them to reissue it because they cancel the checks after days

i work in a book store part time and today i had a really wonderful encounter an older lady came up to cash with a magazine ready to buy it she was really excited talking about how she really loves the designs in the magazine and even showed me a few when i rang the magazine up it wound up being a little bit more due to a recent price increase she became very uncertain and looked through the magazine and sadly decided it wasnt worth the extra cost it went up from around to she left the magazine behind and left the store a woman and her daughter were next in line and overheard part of the conversation they put their purchases on the desk and as they were getting ready to pay the daughter asked about the magazine the lady had left behind she wanted to add it to her transaction and catch up to the lady so she could give it to her the daughter left the money on the counter and ran out the door trying to catch up to the lady i finished up the transaction and started cashing out the next transaction when she returned im happy to say that the daughter did manage to catch up to the older lady and the lady looked super happy to have the magazine its really nice seeing people take an interest in other peoples lives in a positive manner
so this story happened the other day but i was actually a customer in this situation im on mobile so sorry for formatting anyway my boyfriend and i were checking out with a younger cashier about my age and we were joking around as she rang up my items suddenly a middle aged woman stomps up lady excuse me every time i come here i get a cart and leave it aside while i go to the bathroom and every time i come out its gone cashier sorry someone probably saw it and put it away because people leave their carts around all the time lady well you should go get it for me the cashier is halfway through my transaction and looks perplexed i became very bothered as this lady is now interrupting my transaction for this the cashier looks pleadingly over at the closest bagger an elderly woman cashier could you please get this lady a cart the old woman shuffles off mind you the carts are like not fifteen feet away to the right anyway it takes ten seconds for the bagger to retrieve the cart meanwhile the bitchy lady is tapping her foot looking smug boyfriend and i begin rolling our eyes and telling the cashier we are sorry when she gets her cart the lady then leaves us going in the very direction the carts are the lady literally passes the carts by the three of us exclaim she was going that way anyway she just wanted an excuse to bitch and order people around i mean if its a problem why does she have to get a cart before going to the bathroom cant she wait until shes done before getting one cant she go pee before she goes shopping no because that implies she is a thinking and rational creature its annoying when carts pile up because people dump them she just complained that the employees were doing their jobs well i had to stop my boyfriend from angrily approaching her because i didnt want it to escalate but we made sure to make fun of her loud enough for her to hear 
as i mentioned in another post i used to work in a big bookstore at the time this story happened i had worked my way up from inventory clerk to cafe supervisor most retail workers are used to jerks who leave their small children to run free in their stores without supervision while mommy or daddy go out and do whatever in our store when we noticed this happening we usually gave it about two hours before we called the cops to track down the parents on this day the two kids running around our store were being particularly obnoxious they were running behind the register knocking over displays and generally being a nuisance so the only good manager and i went over where they were picking books off of a classics display and throwing them on the floor and asked where their parents were gthorrible child mommys getting her hair and nails done gtme when is she coming back gthorrible child i dunno she said might take like four hours gtmanager ok you guys want to hang out with razorjane in the cafe while i see if i can find your mom gthorrible children yaaaaaay this was a sign that manager was about to call the cops and it was my job to keep the kids busy i herded them over to the cafe where i had one of my baristas whip up two caffeinated extracaramel ice cream drinks and warm up two snickerdoodles the kids continued their wild rumpus at my desk while they got increasingly crackedout on sugar and coffee the cops beat the mom to our store by about ten minutes so she got slapped with a fine for negligence she also got to take home two obnoxious children who were so wound up they probably could have shot themselves into space its so rewarding to be a good samaritan edit for all of you worried about their little hearts on caffeine the kids were like and the single shot of espresso in their drinks would be about equal to a can of soda im guessing that a mom who plans to leave her kids unattended for hours isnt too picky about their food habits
as the title suggests i work in an ice cream shop one of my more important tasks is to make sure no one steals anything on the floor while serving a multitude of customers in walks this group of middle school boys theyre loud and i immediately peg them as the ask for samples and walk away type sure enough all of them ask for samples but then they start ordering they all pick some of the most expensive things on our menu and add a few toppings each this is setting off red flags because ive seen this group before and they always ask for samples and never get anything as the boys move down the line im keeping an eye on the whole group ready to vault over the counter and chase them down if they decide to dine and dash well i didnt have to the last boy that i served payed for the whole group he had gotten some money for his birthday and decided to take out his friends for ice cream gave me the warm fuzzies and made me feel like a cynical jerk at the same time
at the checkouts for a retail store in new zealand credit cards here have now evolved to mostly chip paywave thats where you dont swipe or insert the card at all merely wave it over the terminal and the sale automatically transacts with no pin required on purchases less than at the checkouts and an old man comes forward to buy some shoes as you sometimes get the man flicks his card at me to put through i dont know why people do this when the credit card terminal is right by their face so in the interests of clearing the queue and just being efficient i grab the card and flick it over as a paywave i give the customer his receipt and wish him a good day customer suddenly gets rather upset claiming the money has been stolen etc i offer to return the shoes and then they can buy them again if they wish to try and rectify the situation so this is how it unfolds return shoes customer charges their money back into the cheque account that it came from charge customer for shoes again customer inserts their chip and charges their cheque account as im getting them to sign the slip confirming the return they notice that the money was withdrawn returned and then withdrawn again from the same account what was the point of that they ask you tell me
i used to work for this company that was super strict about how their stores looked and they prided themselves at having arguably some of the best warranty in the business i was at the counter working for the task team that is known as no not saying d anyways i was at the counter when this guy shows up and wants to do a return normally i dont take care of returns as that is customer service but seeing how we are in the same area sometimes they get confused but i decide to help the guy out anyways as the line was long and i was nice that way me how can i help you today grumpy grandpagg i need to do a return me normally returns are done in customer service but i will make an exception and do the return here gg ok me ok now lets take a look here what did you bring in today guy puts down some software in an already opened box me oh im sorry sir but we cant return this i can only exchange it for another of the same title gg no you will return this i want my money back now me firstly sir there is no need to get worked up the receipt states that once opened software cannot be returned secondly please be more calm or i will call loss prevention over gg no you will do your job and give me my money back they promised me this would clean up my viruses and it didnt give me my money back now me sir im going to have to let you know now that i cant do anything about it even if i were to allow the return the system will not allow it and will only let me give you an exchange i cant even give you store credit for this gg get me your manager now cue manager and me telling him what went down manager what seems to be the problem gg your employee was being rude to me and telling me that i should go fk myself hes being racist manager firstly sir i know that what you are telling me didnt happen as i was just in the other isle listening in on the conversation and what my employee told you and what he told me match up and is correct once you open software we can only exchange it for another copy of the same name cue an ensuing argument and manager making an exception gg see i told you that you were going to give me my money back me actually no you told me that i was going to give you your money back i didnt give you anything that was my manager that authorized the return not me he had gotten upset and left the store vowing never to return to which i called out see you tomorrow sure enough like always i see him the next day in the other dept and as i soon as i go up to assist another customer near him i see him dart for another dept out of sheer embarrassment 
another tale from the travel agent with a creepy captain so a few years ago i was given the responsibility of training several new staff members unofficially and without any support time or remuneration of course and as a result had to keep an eye on all customer interactions with the new agents as our job is pretty info heavy in comes the youremyslave lady yms lady for short yms lady has booked her flights online with another company in another state yms lady has selected for her tickets to be smsd to her mobile yms lady has decided that our job is to be an information service and has come to us for us to do her online checkin for her my new agent lets call her kelly tries to halfheartedly explain that its not our job that we didnt do the booking and that she has to do it herself getting nowhere she decides to give in and do the online check in for this lady except she doesnt know how and calls me over all good i come over and start showing her yms lady starts making sarcastic comments to her friend about how we dont know how to do something as simple as our jobs and that it shouldnt take two people to do something so simple we ignore her and check her in heres where the fun begins because yms lady has previously selected mobile itinerary it has defaulted to the same method this is not a system we use and we are only familiar with it from our own travel yms lady wants her boarding pass printed but we cant because shes already checked in and we cant bring it back up now yms lady is screaming at the two of us calling us lazy and incompetent she is threatening to sue us get us fired never book here again which she never had in the first place and stands up to loom over us threateningly my customer service smile has dropped from my face and im responding as little as possible me yms theres nothing else we can do this is something that we have tried to do as a favour for you and i cant help you any further yms dont give me that snotty shit stop being so uptight and bitchy and do your fing job me if you continue to yell at us like this i will have to ask you to leave yms you can try bitch look at you you snooty cow your head is so far up your ass you should be inside out me please leave otherwise i will be forced to call security yms you can bloody well try ive been thrown out of worse places than this im sure she has this is the point that i lost my temper somewhere in her rambling yelling as she slammed her hands on the counter and made a motion to hit me me if you touch a single hair on my head i will call the police on you now get the hell out of my store yms how dare you speak to me like that youre so fired me yeah well im not too worried ive never had a complaint before and im sure theyd know better than to listen to a crazy person like you that is not even a customer with that i grabbed kelly and we walked into the back room yms screamed threw some last parting words knocked all of the stationery off our desks and stormed off with her meek silent friend in tow told boss who laughed and bought us coffees to recover from the stress kelly and i snuck away called the airline pretended to be her and cancelled her flight tldr it was nonrefundable 
so since my first two post went well heres a third one like in my last story i worked at a sunglass shop in the older part of my city on this day i had a female customer come in she was about brunette and a hourglass figure lets call her hf i being the sells man i am automatically ask if she needs and help she says no and looks around the store when another customer comes in this customer is a guy whom i usually dont do my pitches to since they always just ignore me well he notices hf and trys on some glasses next to her when he trys on the most expensive pair in the rack in front of him hf tells him that they look great on him also that he should buy them so he comes up to the register and pays for them then he tries to talk to hf who started talking up another pair of shades to another female hf ended up talking people into buying expensive shades that day at the end of it all she cqme up to me and asked if that counted as a live interview then leaves her info and goes in with her day trdl customer comes in and sells the product for me and ends up getting a job 
i worked at a big box warehouse type store a few years back and its one of those stores that have branded credit cards with the persons face on it it always baffled me that customers would write check id or see drivers license on the back of them but as i was supposed to do whenever someone put that on their card i would ask for their actual id most people would say why my pictures right there i know but you wrote check dl in all caps where your signature should be so i am obligated to ask from this point one of two things would happen theyd show me their id apologetically and feeling a little stupid theyd continue to call me stupid or act like i was a neanderthal while showing me their id in my earlier posts i mentioned that this store was in a higher income neighborhood so we had a lot of people in their golf attire come in one such fellow did polo shirt tucked into his khakis white visor graying hair and a goatee he was a portly fellow possibly from eating too much wine and cheese at this point in my career im sick of the job and my shittaking levels are at record lows he clearly wrote check drivers license on the card with his photo on it so before i charged it i asked for it thats me yes i know its you but since you wrote to check your license i have to ask thats fucking stupid im not taking out my id im not charging the card then you little shit do you know who i am im not taking out my id i have no idea who you are because you wont show me your id the line is long as all hell because its one of those stores and its a weekend and its coupon time well im not leaving until you ring me up this asshole says at this point i give him back his card alright then ring yourself up i said locked my register and walked away some supervisor finished his order while i ate a snickers bar in the breakroom and watched whatever was on the tv i didnt get into any trouble because the customers after him told the supervisor what a dick the guy was everyone talked about doing that one day and i actually did i worked there for more years after leveling up on self respect that day 
hi everyone you all are so sweet so i thought i would share another retail story that involves a problematic vendor as opposed to a customer as you guys know i own a small business where i hand make items and also have some resell items i set up a booth at events and sell that way for whatever reason vendors are angry territorial people not all of them but a larger majority than seems reasonable i am the jane villanueva in a world full of multiple versions of a very pregnant petra solano all angry one rainy october morning two falls back i was setting up at an outdoor dog event things were going slowly because it was super early in the morning and im a horrible morning person and the rain was keeping myself and my helper from being able to fully walk outside of the tent and set up from both sides of the table we werent in fear of the rain because we were the wicked witch of the west but because it was about degrees out and neither one of us wanted to freeze our buns off for the next eight hours just because we were stupid enough to go stand in the rain to set up my partner and i had our heads down and were working on taking things out of the boxes and setting them up on the tables we werent paying as much attention to our vendor space as we normally would because the event was blocked off to customers for another hour and a half so all that surrounded us were vendors most which i knew from other dog events we travel in packs pun intended i happened to look up to where i had my dog tutus hanging on the one rack inside the tent and see a large heavily tattooed man with multiple holes in his clothes who was not at all dressed for the weather pulling at my one tutu effectively taking it apart i was slow to understand at first but when the realization came upon me that this guy was a vendor that apparently had nothing better to do than come pick apart my items it got hairy i will be me and he will be j for jerk gtme excuse me can i help you with something gtj i want to see how you make your tutus we want to make them and cant figure out how continues to physically pull apart my tutu gtme thats fine but you cant tear apart my product just so you can learn how to make something you cant be in my booth either we are still setting up and closed as i imagine you are as well since we have quite awhile until the start of the event please put the tutu down and leave youre not welcome to come back and look at it later please figure out how to make them on your own like i did gtj well ive already got it halfway apart im going to take this over to my wife and show her how you did these as i mentioned this guy was large but there was no way in the world he was going to continue to ruin something i so lovingly made and leave the tent with it there were security guards everywhere so i flew out of my tent and grabbed a security guard i quickly explained that another vendor was destroying one of my items and trying to leave my booth with it security stopped the guy halfway out of my booth took the tutu off of him and let him know that he could stay set up that day since he was already setting up but wasnt welcomed back he also wasnt allowed anywhere near my booth i ran into the duo at two other events neither of which they are allowed back to during the one they were set up across from me they continued to encroach on another womans booth continually moving their stuff over until they blocked it they were asked to pack up early at the other event we were supposed to set up beside them and i very politely told the person running it about the issue we had with them previously they moved us down and swapped us spaces with the humane society thinking that they wouldnt harass an animal shelter wrong theyve basically been blackballed at vendor shows in our area to the point where theyre kind of their own legend apparently they harass people everywhere they go and everyone knows who they are because of their appearance they always wear ratty and torn clothes act uncivilized and drop constant f bombs and other language inappropriate for family events and chain smoke the whole way through an event im hoping to avoid them forever tldr vendor tries to tear apart my dog tutu so he can learn how to make them himself and was escorted from my booth by security and banned from coming back i find out this is typical behavior for this vendor 
hello again its been a while this story is about one of my colleagues and happened a week or two ago my coworker j was serving a customer at the front counter and i was standing a meter or so away minding my own business when gt oh my gosh i hit the wrong button help manager manager of course the manager came running to investigate what horrendous situation had just unfolded gt i was putting the change into the computer so that it would tell me how much i had to give back and i put too much in she gave me but i told the computer it was help again i was standing just meters away and i couldnt help but listen in no worries though its obviously a simple problem and manager will know how to fix it nope gt manager ah get me a calculator manager proceeded to smash buttons into the calculator furiously as though this was a complex equation that needed serious thought by this stage im getting concerned for the reputation of our international company i mean one staff member struggling to do maths with numbers below is bad enough but the manager as well i looked on the screen and saw that the customers items came to and j had entered thus needing change if the customer had actually given to j then she simply needed to grab an extra out of the til problem solved in my most nonchalant tone i quietly said gtwell she just needs an extra no manager pushed a few extras keys on the calculator to confirm i suppose gt manager well yes of course simple j give the lady an extra so frustrating

i work for a rental car company at an international airport i was having a pretty routine day working outside in the parking garage in our kiosk when a young woman popped up at my window i didnt even see her approach i slid the window open and before i could even greet her she slapped some paperwork down on the counter in front of me and went off im here to get a different car the one you gave us has insert laundry list of problems here and we want a discount because of the inconvenience of having to drive all the way back here to take care of this and etc etc i was trying to cut in at any opportunity but she wouldnt let up for probably two or three minutes when she finally stopped talking i told her im not going to be able to help you wherein she butt in im supposed to talk to some guys name ive never heard of where is he i told her im not sure who that is but he probably works for rental company shown on the paperwork just then the guy she was traveling with showed up behind her and said to her thats not who we rented from and pointed to another kiosk nearby she took a step back looked up to actually read the sign on the kisok then snatched up her paperwork and turned away to go to the correct kiosk yes our colors are similar but its the words on signs that matter right
mom and year old daughter come through my line with just basic groceries after the initial greeting and small talk the little girl looks up and asks me if she can pay for her baby a little confused i look up at mom and she says her daughters asking if she can pay for her invisible baby i giggle a little and tell the girl that i can absolutely let her do that so i have her come around the counter invisible baby in her arms and scan the baby over the register she squeals with delight and runs back around the counter to mom her mom laughed and said thanks saying that most people just smile but never play along with her imagination then the girl asks if she can have a bag to put her baby in not wanting to give a small child a plastic bag i pulled out a paper bag that has handles and her whole face just lit up she had the biggest grin as she put her invisible baby into the bag and held on to it tight mom was smiling and told me i just made the girls day and she just knows shes gonna carry that bag around for at least a week if she can love the small things so can i so needless to say that five minute encounter put a smile on my face for the rest of the night 
customerssigh so this particular person has an appointment at pm to see the doctor we call her the day before to confirm she is coming and she says she will be at the time of the appointment she doesnt turn up we called her at to see if shes stuck in traffic or something and if we should hold on a little longer theres no answer so the doctor starts seeing other patients at pm the patient turns up and just says oh sorry im a little late i was caught up in work im here now though so let the doctor know im ready to see him really not even a real apology and why did you turn up three hours late and not even inform us i said well the doctor has taken other patients and he is really tightly booked today and he has a surgery at pm to prepare for i really dont think theres a chance to see him today i will however let him know youre here since youre just here to review your test results and it might not take a long time yeah whatever ill just sit here then i checked with the doctor and informed her ok he is willing to see you but there may be a long waiting time he has to attended the other patients first and only if he finishes a bit early you can have ten minutes to see him skip forward minutes patient seriously is this the sort of service you offer ive been waiting now for minutes to see the doctor this is unprofessional im a patient and deserve proper treatment im sorry for the wait but you turned up very late and completely missed your appointment the doctor might be able to squeeze you in but he must see his other patients who had appointments she argues back my supervisor gets involved and i have an incident report written against me regarding the way i turn patients away bitch
hey guys first post ever on reddit whoop whoop longtime lurker though i have worked at a grocery chain for a while now and we have cycled through many managers though our current manager is a little insane she once smiled and me and a customer and then we walked into the back and she started screaming and throwing bottles of alcohol all over the stocking area because it was unorganized i have a book ill put up here one day on her anywho i am one of the few people in our store who has experience working in the fuel center its a x box you stand in hating your life it has no restroom this is important im doing uscan and bouncing to a cash register and trying to keep people from all going to one line etc i get a call on my little wireless phone from the fuel center that the new girl had the screen freeze up on her this happens often since the computer out there is about years old so i go out and fix it but notice her acting a little funny kinda faint and sluggish so i ask her if shes fine and shes like i got here at and i havent had a break to eat or go to the bathroom i gave her this look of wtf apparently no one notified us that the front end needed to do her break today usually they work it out that people come early or stay late so the person out there gets their breaks and it was pm i phoned in to the front and said i was giving her her lunch and theyll have to handle the front until after that i dont know how a high school aged pregnant girl survived out there for hours without a stop i made a new sheet that i schedule their breaks with ours to ensure they all get their breaks now seriously these people that forget about us peons
this happened in my days of fast food servitude about two months after i started we had a guy show up asking if he could do some work outside for us in exchange for a meal now we all hated the outside jobs so my manager gave him the goahead minimum wage is and one of our meals is around so he gave him a few tasks and told him for one hour of work he could have a meal so this guy picked up cigarette butts pulled weeds and swept the lot for an hour after that he came in are his meal thanked everyone working shook my managers hand and left he came back the next weekend and asked the same thing and my manager agreed again this went on for about months every weekend about weeks into this routine the time he comes in is about halfway through my shift and he seems like a nice genuine dude so i take my break and eat with him we chat a bit and i make this a weekly thing taking my break to eat with him every one he comes in i gradually learn his story hes in his mids used to own a good sized landscaping company with crews that went around doing mostly commercial jobs but also doing private jobs occasionally his wife was killed in a traffic accident in when they were both around he didnt feel right dating again after that so he was still single years later they didnt have kids so his company was all he had and he completely immersed himself in it however with the crash in his company slowly went under he had to sell off his trucks and lay off his crews one by one until it was just a single truck with himself and a couple guys who had been with him for years finally he had to sell that truck too and he fell into a really bad depression with his wife gone no family and no company he lost all his drive he lost his house and car and began living in the streets trying his luck as a day laborer there are a lot of hispanic laborers in the area who worked for a lot less though so he rarely got work anyway he kept this up for a few months eventually starting to come in or days a week i left the store early this year and he was still there and a month after i left so did our maintenance guy my manager ended up hiring the guy full time on maintenance and he really got his shit together last i heard he was preparing to move into a new apartment his first home in years tldr homeless guy asks to work for food ends up being hired full time got his life back together 
i work at a more expensive clothing retailer we sell more business type clothing along with casual clothing as a result our casual clothing can get a bit pricey so earlier this week we had three customers walk in im assuming it was a woman with her husband and her sister so theyre going around our store looking at the casual clothing now keep in mind that these customers are regulars and shop here frequently so they know our policies by heart they ask a bunch of our staff for help specifically for help with the womans denim shorts they keep asking if its bogo free and theres clearly a sign right on the table saying bogo so of course we say no and inform them of the correct deal they do this to every associate and expect a different answer nope same answer they try everything on and come to the register and my coworker cw rings them up this is what i hear cw find everything okay woman the wife everything was fine but i need to get my total under i only have on me cw okay well see where the price comes too but just by looking at everything you have i think youll be over cw rings everything up and sure enough its around woman is that before or after the sale cw excuse me woman theres a sale going on right everything is off cw im sorry but that sale ended three weeks ago woman oh but the shorts rang up as buy one get one free right cw no miss they are buy one get one you asked me this same question minutes ago and they arent bogo free woman but i talked to managers name and he said it was buy one get one free cw starts getting snooty cw oh really because managers name isnt even in he hasnt been here all day woman oh well someone told me cw maam i cant change the price because you want me to even if an associate accidentally stated the wrong deal i cannot alter the price due to one small error woman i need the price to be under cant you just help me out cw if you have coupons that havent expired then sure we can help you that way woman what about off of every specific amount spent here i have it on my phone cw that expired three days ago and i cant override expired coupons thats just how our system works woman but i need it under cant you just reduce the price for me cw nope im not allowed to and i wont get fired because you dont have enough money woman but i need it under cw im sorry i cant do anything i cant offer you off by signing up for our charge card because i know you have one but i know how you can get it under woman how cw by not buying everything i dont know why but i started laughing and had to cover my mouth to prevent myself from laughing out loud she ended up taking off a lot of small items to get her total under why she didnt ask her husband or sister for some money i dont know why she could have paid them back people are weird edit wow i didnt expect my post to get this much attention thanks for reading and voting everyone
ok guys not my first tfr but my first one for my new job here goes about three weeks ago i started at a large telecom company in their customer service branches a girl whom we shall call amy started the week before me but left for a holiday bad timing on new jobs came back and were both on the counter doing payasyougo topups bill payments etc ive gotten the general hang of everything today a woman came into the store while i was assisting a customer and amy called her over very politely and professionally her response was ill wait for one of the men to serve me nup you did not just say that so she waits for me and asks for a topup and i reply with sorry im new here holding up my trainee badge and turn to amy and said how do you process a top up voucher again amy walks me through the steps and i stuff up a few times and then the woman asks for me to put it onto a broadband device before i finish the transaction note we finish the transaction first otherwise we dont have the voucher code amy tells her that i need to finish the transaction first and i start stammering and asking how to do that this caused the woman to freak out and ask for someone else so david came over and ran the transaction through she asked if she could get topups elsewhere and it she could do it at home and left later i went on break and she was still in the shopping centre and refused to make eye contact with me and the best part she came back later not knowing how to activate it herself and she saw me working with a customer like normal doing the exact same thing she wanted take that you rude cow tldr woman refused to be served by woman had to deal with incompetent me edit oh oh oh i remember when she came back i zoomed in on her on the security camera and the assistant manager said shes been in the store and acted like a cow to the staff before 
i work at a drugstore that sells cigarettes usually on the front counter where said cigarettes are i have to card anyone i think looks under as is typical of most places i get a number of young people who sigh annoyedly or complain that they never get carded anywhere else but its typically not that bad except for this one woman i have a line at my register and this woman comes up next in it looks maybe in her early s she asks for a pack of camels so i pull one off the rack behind me and ask to see her id she briefly looks in her purse gther i left it at home cant you just take my birthday and put it in gtme no i cant do that i have to see an id gther what but that one black girl the manager always just puts in my birthday i come here all the time and its fine i know exactly who shes talking about but i have no idea who this woman is never seen her before in my life gtme well shes not a manager and shes certainly not supposed to be doing that i wont be doing it either youre welcome to come back with your id i put the cigarettes back on the rack and go to move on to the next customer gther this is ridiculous i am years old i should be allowed to buy my damn cigarettes gtme sorry i cant sell them to you like i said if you come back with a valid id i will be more than happy to sell them to you she walks a bit away and i resume going through my line then she approaches a man in the back of the line who is clearly old enough to buy tobacco with greying hair and wrinkles gther rather loudly hey man heres bucks buy me a pack of camel crush i pause in ringing up my customer gtme mam i cant sell to him now either because i know hes buying them for someone whose age i cant verify gther what the hell this is ridiculous go ask any of the other employees here theyll recognize me and tell you how old i am and even if you dont know how old i am he believes me you can sell to him hes clearly old enough gtme youre welcome to go ask them if theyll sell to you i wont i dont know you i have no reason to believe you when you say how old you are and i wont get in trouble for selling to you just because you say i should gther yeah but youre not selling to me youre selling to him gtme yes but i heard you ask him to buy them for you in the eyes of our company and the law its the same as if i sold them directly to you gther thats just retarded what do you even know gtme i dont make the rules i just follow them she starts to get very dramatic here acting like shes going to die without her cigarettes and how i a child cant tell her year old self what to do shes throwing a fit in front of my register and the other customers are staring and starting to get impatient in the line she even goes so far as to try and shove a picture in my face of her child as if a picture of some child i dont know proves shes as old as she says she is i get fed up and call for a manager over the pa the manager on duty calls the register and asks what i need and i tell him that a woman is very upset that i wont sell her cigarettes gther i am not upset sure you arent my manager says hell be right there she isnt willing to wait around and storms out before he even gets there presumably to try the same thing at the gas station across the street seriously though acting like a year old whose mom isnt buying her the candy she wants isnt any way to prove youre an adult really

we have two sets of registers in the athletic themed store where i work one does returnsexchanges and the other does not the one that doesnt do them has signs all over it saying where we do them so customers can see them and not wait in line only for us to tell them to go to the other registers today was busy like really super busy damn you football and i was at the registers that dont do returnsexchanges the line would build up and the other girl on the registers and i would get through it as fast as we could so people wouldnt get mad a lady gets to my register after waiting in line for a few minutes less than ten minutes and is holding a bag from where i work and says she wants to do a return i tell her that im sorry but i cant do returns at these registers if she goes to the other set of registers they can help her there she was not happy gtcustomer very loudly goddammit are you fucking kidding me the line over there is ridiculous thats why i came over here you should really put up signs so people can know so i pointed to the blaze orange x sign attached to all the registers and the five neon yellow x signs on the poles next to the line where she had been standing for the last few minutes gtme there are nearly all around these registers gtcustomer still very loudly im filling a corporate compliant about you i shouldnt have to deal with this you should have just done my return so she throws down the bag with her returns in it and storms off im confused the other cashier is confused and the other customers in line that started paying attention when she raised her voice are confused barely a minute later she stomps back over grabs her bag and nearly runs out of the store a few customers laughed and i refrained from laughing i can only assume im going to have to talk to a manager tomorrow but the other cashier will back me up that it was the customer that screwed up not me
i work at a bank we have a grace period of few minutes after our official closing to allow last minute folks to do a quick teller transactions some people abuse this policy this lady is one of them she habitually comes to our branch minutes after our official closing time her transactions are never quick or organized so yesterday when i see her pull into the parking lot i sigh i look at the clock its a few minutes into our grace period shes got minutes to get in the building i say to my coworkers she sits in her car a minute im waiting for her to get out a few more minutes go by and she continues to sit in her car finally our grace period is over and shes made no attempt to enter the building one of our bankers goes to close the door and i shut the drivethru my manager runs to hit the lights we finish our closing routine it is now minutes passed closing she then gets out of her car tries the door looks in and turns back to her car she wouldve made the grace period and she not sat in her car like a dumbass i guess she figured we would let her in no matter what time it was it felt so satisfying to lock the doors on her after she continued to abuse the grace period time 
i work in a popular retail store in the states more specifically i have worked primarily in the clothing department for years my store is geared towards middle class familys but occasionally we will get the upper class snobs this is where my story begins its right before christmas and im working in the jewelry a few departments that day when you work in jewelry you have to have a pair of keys on you in case a shopper wants to look at something inside a case anyways im putting away some items in another department when i get a call over the walkie to assist a guest at the jewelry booth so i go up and see a man probably in his s with his two teenage sons the oldest could not have been more then and the other one just a little younger this is how the next half hour of life goes me will be me ad will be asshole dad ns will be older and nervous son and ys will be younger son gtme hello my name is moonlitcat how may i help you today gtad yeah yeah gee what a great start gtad see my son bought this heart necklace for his girlfriend here earlier today and when he told me the price i told him to return it and get something better for her this sweet guy bought his girlfriend a cute heart necklace for christmas how sweet is that gtme oh im sorry was there anything wrong with the item gtad looks at son yeah it was dirt cheap gtns looks at floor ashamed whoa whoa whoa for one this kid could not have been more then years old therefore i highly doubt he had a job or if he did one that didnt pay very well second this necklace was about dollars something that i know when i was was a lot of money at the time gtme with the best smile i can muster okay well is there anything you see that you like in the cases gtad points to a lunar moon necklace how much is this one gtme about gtad hmmp do you have anything thats more expensive gtme im afraid not really sir gtys to his brother uh oh here we go gtns sighs gtad wow your stuff here is super cheap how do you guys make any money i mentioned before that our store is geared towards middle class familys were not a cheap store but at the same time our prices arent so high up that we have people coming in wearing furs and diamonds gtme nervous giggle haha well we do sir gtad well if you were receiving a piece of jewelry wouldnt you rather it be more expensive then cheap i look at the dad then look back at the older and nervous son as he looks incredibly defeated and hurt by his fathers words gtme honestly sir its the thought and feeling behind the gift that makes it more meaningful to me then the price i do and did truly mean that the older and nervous son looked at me with a thank you expression on his face while his younger brother chimed in in agreement gtys yeah dad i agree with her gtad sighs okay i guess we will look around a bit more this seems to be where the story ends but nope while the family or i should say the dad looks around for a gift for the older sons girlfriend i go back to another section to help another coworker out its not long until i hear that alert for the jewelry booth again yafreakinhoo i go back up to see the dad and his sons again and dad tapping the counter in annoyance gtad we decided to take the moon necklace we saw before unless your sure that this is the most expensive thing you have here dude seriously let the price go gtad i mean dont you think your items here are cheap they probably break after wearing them once too if i wasnt upset by the dads treatment of his son before trust me when i say i was mad at this point i should also mention that not one but a couple of my supervisors were close by and getting bits and pieces about what was going on gtme no sir i think the items are a good price for the quality you are getting gtad which is cheap gtme pretty much done sir would you like the necklace or would you like me to put it back gtad to ns you want it gtns sighs in defeat yeah i guess the dad first hands me a giftcard that is worth around dollars fine done processed it gtme okay sir you still have about and whatever change left the asshole of a dad then hands me a bill and then give me such a smug im better then your little store look i quickly just took the and gave back his roughly speaking dollars back in change and told the family to have a nice day the sons are really embarrassed and are mouthing sorry to me over and over again before they leave though the dad says to me gtad you know you should really try to go to college and do better for yourself so let me get this straight one you make your son return an item that he bought with his own money for his girlfriend that has a lot of heart behind it i dont care if the guy is only he obviously cares a lot about this girl second you disrespect my store by calling it cheap over and over again and even try to get me to call it cheap and possibly get fired because my supervisors are listening and third you disrespect me and give me a mouth load of crap telling me to do better for myself and go to college why do you think i have this job in the first place do not invade in my personal life luckily as soon as the dad said that the younger son in complete horror thanked me for my help and made his dad leave the counter while the older and nervous son apologized for his fathers behavior and thanked me for my patience and left after i breathed in and out for a couple minutes i went back to the fitting room to grab more items to get put away and guess what i found the heart necklace that the dad made his son return i know in one sense the dad felt like he was helping out his son but in all reality it was really just making his son feel ashamed for something he should not have ever felt shameful about edit for formatting and grammar edit holy smokes guys this isnt as much an edit as it is a thank you as amazing as this story is i never thought id get this kind of response tldr asshole of a dad makes his son return a necklace he thought was too cheap for his sons girlfriend and continued calling my store cheap until he left 
the past three days one specific customer lets call her marie has entered the store looking for a washer and dryer all three days i opened the store and she would walk in around am a strong woman with consumer reports magazines in her hand and an opinion about everything i showed her each day with her was a headscratcher and more confusing than the day before day she enters the store since her washer and dryer broke and wants the one in the ad since thats on back order for a week i start showing her other things in the store while asking questions with each washer and dryer that i show her she nitpicks well consumer reports say this washer and dryer isnt good because it doesnt have steam or consumer reports says high efficiency detergent is a waste of time so i dont want to hear it she applies for our instore card and is approved for but still wants to shop around i give her my card and she scurries to our competitors day marie comes back in and says we have the best deal in town yep but wants financing her say months interest free i cant control what the computer gives us and i explain that to her as well as my manager well competing store had the same washer and dryer i want for less and six months financing so i will just go there wait didnt you say that we had the best deal in town marie leaves again now at this point i didnt think she would come back and neither does anyone in the store day as i am cleaning behind a washer and dryer i hear someone calling my name from the front desk there stands another manager and marie consumer reports in hand invoices in hand sorry i left they had the same washer and dryer but wouldnt give me the deal again you can see on these invoices the invoices had different model numbers but her heart was set on a silver set could i add a dishwasher with it i need to get mine changed anyway of course you can i said it in my cheeriest retail voice and found her a dishwasher that would not only match with the washer and dryer but would also match her fridge in her kitchen i go to the register to check stock on everything everything is in stock delivery would be scheduled for monday and we would hook it all up plus a mailin rebate because the washer and dryer and dishwasher were the same brand plus delivery rebate basically she would get back in a credit to use in the store the total for everything was around so she decided to pay in cash and put the rest on the store credit card to receive interestfree payments again the computer automatically decides the financing option depending on the total months months months and above and all of it interestfree to me this was a great deal but anyway after she pays her in cash i run the card for the remaining and i thought the computer would give her months it didnt it gave her months under the umbrella that the total before cash was in the months range and even though she paid in cash she would have months to pay now in my mind and the mind of everyone around me this was great you had longer to pay it off not so much marie flips her mind i dont want months i only want months financing why cant you get that in your peanut head what did i tell you yesterday tell the computer to give me months again i cant tell the computer to do it and she would have a longer time to pay it off well maam you can pay it off in months or shorter you dont have to go to the full twentyfour months its all interest free that isnt good to her because she wants it in writing on my goddamned bill she throws her magazines down on the ground takes back her and makes a scene by screaming at the computer give me months dammit she walks out without buying the washer dryer and dishwasher my manager looks at me as well as a couple of associates with confused faces moomatic you have to stop bringing out the crazy in customers my manager tried to say in a straight face but just couldnt stop laughing

background i work as an assistant manager at a large chicken fastfood chain while putting my way through med school i can only work parttime due to my studies but the company was great about letting me keep my job since ive been with them since high school the story this happened in the very first week of undergrad id only been managing shifts for weeks a lady came in to the restaurant with her kids it was a bit of a slow day and we had competent employees on shift so i went out to clean some tables and greet customers like our district manager wanted us to hi welcome to chicken restaurant how are you today i said that to this lady with a big smile and she just sort of gave me a weird look and went up to the cashier whatever it is kind of weird that we are greeting people at a fastfood place i continued to clean up as the lady made a big order for her kids and her i noticed to my annoyance that she ordered water for herself and then put sweet tea in the cup note that our water cups are different from drink cups and made of clear plastic so this takes a lot of cojones to do right in front of a manager ah well i thought she gave us plenty of money on the order nothing i can do about the drink well i finished sweeping up the lobby and then went back behind the counter to check on the cooks who naturally were doing their job perfectly food is coming up people are eating it its a great shift but then this lady decides to ruin it and come up to talk to me dragging her two kids behind and holding a plate of halfeaten food lets call her annoying annoying are you a manager me yes maam how is your visit to chicken restaurant today a you guys got my order wrong me oh i am sorry to hear that let me see a hands me receipt we ordered chicken sandwich with clever rhyming name but actually got chicken meal with a hilarious pun name me well maam the receipt has the chicken meal on here how do you think that happened never suggest that an employee messed up because they will jump on that suggestion like its a wounded antelope a i think the cashier misheard the order of course the cashier misheard the order i get about people a week saying that this happened so that the manager will cave and give them something free i normally just go along with it i have to by company policy if they make a formal complaint anyway but not today today i have started college i can stand up to these other adults now me well i specifically heard the cashier repeat the order to you i dont see how that could have happened i think you simply misspoke a no i didnt i want a refund on this meal and the correct one for free me im afraid i cant do that youve already eaten most of this meal you should have come up and told me right away i hope you have a good day and enjoy that drink you didnt pay for we look forward to seeing you again annoying turned bright bright red as her kids looked up at her the twelveyearold smartass son spoke up mommy i toldddd you that cup was only for water she told me that i had been very unhelpful and sped out the door she never gave me a complaint and all the employees on shift loved me forever i still have to give in to scammers fairly regularly ie all the time jeez its awful but man did it feel good to see one put in her place
okay so i am a lurker who has never desired to create a reddit account nor participate sorry but this happened to me yesterday and i knew it was my duty as a retail monkey to share with you all im also maybe looking for some advice last night about a half hour before my shift at the gas station ended pervert walks in to buy some gas and a bag of chips as i swipe his card he starts moaning very loudly i ask him whats wrong and he asks if i can swipe it again well no sir the transaction went through it wont be necessary to swipe your card again for this purchase so if i buy something else youll swipe my big card through that slit of yours again i want it swiped good and fast it was then that i realized what he was doing of course i am totally disgusted but in a moment of weakness and not knowing what to do i did not refuse service and i let him buy a candy bar however this time i did not swipe his card but manually keyed his number in he still moaned a second time and laughed as he exited i am so grossed out whats going on with the world i dont even livework in a particularly bad city this guy was just an awful human being
when i was a bit younger i worked for a mom and pop sandwich and coffee shop in a cute little connecticut town the job wasnt too bad though we had to wear stupid polo shirts with the company logo printed on the breast which we had to pay for i basically spent most of my time taking orders making fancy coffee drinks and handing out food to those that decided to sit in to eat as winter rolled around i asked the boss for a week to go back to my fine home state of montana for a visit he said that it would be fine and gave me the time off all went pretty well until about three days before i was scheduled to return i got a call from the bossman informing me that he had fired one of my coworkers for some offense or another and needed me in asap i told him that i couldnt adjust my tickets and besides i was in a huge state about three hours from an airport while being at the mercy of other people who wanted to drive me around after making many frustrated noises he finally acknowledged his request was unreasonable and i assured him id be home when i planned the day of the return trip arrived and i was off on my way to a connecting flight in minneapolisst paul sadly this is where i was locked down after many weather delays my flight was finally cancelled no dice nothing coming or going until the next morning i immediately called the bossman and let him know the situation on his voicemail much to my surprise i arrived at work asap to see if they could use me for the shift and was promptly told that i do not work there any longer much wat fuck him anyhow i thought and walked next door to my buddys bookstore to see if he could use a hand seeing as i was now jobless he agreed and all was well though my hours were much reduced the best part was one day when my friend and i were parked in such a way that was blocking the former bossmans truck and he wanted out instead of asking he walked up to my friends driver side window and started a rude rant which was quickly shut down when he noticed me in the passenger seat giving him a withering look it felt pretty good

obligatory mobile formatting message so working retail in a mall that serves a wide area of neighborhoods we get people from all walks of life applying mostly local students between school yearssemesters but occasionally we get less reputable folks this is the story of one such hires last appearance in the store for some background j as ill call him was hired last september to work mattresses since one of the other guys was leaving they wound up staying but we kept j anyway because the sm said we needed to fill the schedule with hours so j finishes training and comes down to the sales floor and promptly falls asleep at the mattress register in plain view of the entire store and of course his behavior gets worse smoking weed before coming in falling asleep multiple times a shift cursing in front ofat customers not even getting off his ass sitting on the display recliners and shouting at customers if they need help etc but despite everyone even the asms wanting him gone sm refused to fire j eventually december rolls around j is cut to hours a week because a we all hate him and he messes up sales and b those were the hours that were available weeks pass shifts missed nocallnoshow each time hes fired for abandoning the job when the termination letter goes out his mom finally calls saying hes in the hospital too little too late we explain and thats that until last thursday when j walks in through the door and has the balls to ask gt j yo who do i talk to about getting back on the schedule to which we stare dumbfounded at the guy and tell him youre fired you dont work here gt j i was in the hospital come on man how can i get back on and we tell him again you basically abandoned the job for a month no calls at all you lost the job j just keeps whining he was in the hospital and eventually goes up to hr few minutes later he leaves without a word when we told our manager his response was what we assume hrs was as well oh well lol edit fixed stupid auto correct
repost from rpettyrevenge by request about years ago when i used to work at a pharmacy as a tech a middle aged deaf woman came in for a refill so she and i communicated by written notes as she and i are writing notes back and forth to each other a douche bag walks up talking on the cell phone and proceeds to complain about this woman to the other person on the phone he was a truly hateful prick about it and was so obnoxious needless to say i personally filled her prescriptions and had her out the door in less than five minutes however for some inexplicable reason his prescription kept getting sent to the end of the line never to be filled after about minutes he asks to speak to my boss and complains about it taking so long it was one of the busiest pharmacies in kansas city but tons of people that came in after him were getting their meds and leaving my boss calms him down by telling him that his script would be next and walks over to me and says whats the deal here why do you keep moving his stuff to the back of the line i straightup told my boss what the douche bag was doing and that it really pissed me off my boss a really cool guy says right on then kept the asshole waiting another half hour
so i was at work and as usual asking customers if they need any help i approach this woman and ask do you need any help there she replies yes im just looking to try on some skirts i reply yes of course the changing rooms are straight ahead of you she then quite condescendingly and angrily replies yes of course i know that i then reply ok cool she then replies well you asked me whether i was ok now im tellling you it is cool isnt it i then walked off i literally got verbally harassed for asking someone if they needed any help

i am in a middle management position and i work for a bakery which is owned by a multinational corporation we sell cookies muffins coffee smoothies etc not long after christmas i felt unwell and called in sick to work i had vomited that morning because of a stomach bug i was told by my manager that because there was nobody available to cover my shift i still had to come into work reluctantly i took some pain killers and made the hourlong journey to work i felt rough most of the day and tried to focus on administrative tasks and paperwork rather than serve customers its not nice for a customer to be served by someone who looks like death warmed up hours into my shift i start to feel sick again so i go to the toilet and end up vomiting again once id finished i phoned my manager and said i was leaving because i had just vomited again i was warned that if i did that i would possibly leave myself open to a disciplinary for leaving the shop insecure because i was the only key holder on shift and nobody else was allowed to close the shop unless a key holder was present i was advised to take it easy for the rest of the shift hours later and i could finally leave after what was quite possibly the worst shift in my years working in retail i took the next five days off work to recover and put the whole incident behind me flash forward weeks and i receive a letter addressed to me delivered to my work this is unusual this had never happened before so i open the letter and inside is a short generic letter inviting me for an investigation meeting on the other side of the city with a manager of another store i had never heard of my immediate reaction in my head was oh its probably about that customer who tried to assault another member of staff a few weeks ago i was on shift and a drunken customer accused a member of staff of short changing him so he took a swing and tried to hit him because of the nature of the incident we had to report it even though he wasnt hurt so i pop along to this investigation meeting and im met by the manager mentioned in the letter and a younger guy in his early s who is there to take notes the meeting is conducted in a kitchen with no seats which seems a little unusual for a formal meeting but none the less i am not too bothered he introduces himself to me and myself to him he begins by asking where i usually take my lunch breaks this is not really what i expected but lets carry on i explain i usually take my lunch break in the food court the guy taking notes writes down all the questions and my answers word for word anywhere else is the next question well i occasionally go to the park in the summer and have my lunch there not a prohibited practice in any case as our lunch breaks are unpaid would you ever take your lunch in the shop this is against company policy because of food safety etc no i dont i like to get out of there for a while i quip to try and lighten the atmosphere ok would you ever use your mobile phone in the shop he asks yes i use it occasionally to contact the manager when he is not in the shop or to contact the delivery driver because the land line phone in the shop has stopped working this is an honest answer and a reasonable one i should refuse to use my own phone for work use but im a nice guy have you ever used your phone for texting people while you were at work im asked well i text the manager a few times with sales figures but not very often his tone of voice becomes increasingly aggressive with no known cause at this point what do you have to say about this he presents me with an a size glossy photo of myself sitting on a chair in the back of the shop with my phone in my hand the photo seems to have been taken on a long lens camera from a considerable distance from the outside of the shop the date and time stamp on the photo correspond to the day i was sick a few weeks earlier i then tell him this was an occasion when i was feeling unwell and i forced to attend work and was not allowed to leave my shift to go home despite the fact that i had vomited twice that day because of a stomach bug you expect me to believe that after being sick your manager said you had to come to work then prevents you from going home when you are sick again and tells you to take it easy i am now feeling angry and shocked at his response however i have something he didnt expect yes i do expect you to believe it i reach for my phone in my pocket and play back the calls i record all of my calls just in case something happened although i never expect myself to be in this position this is completely legal where i live after playing the recordings he tells me that its against company policy to have my phone in an investigation meeting im sure he made that up otherwise he would have said it before i played the recordings i then tell him excuse me i think the bigger issue here is that company name has broken food safety law by forcing a member of staff who has been sick to work around food since the start of this meeting the guy taking notes has been writing everything said word for word the manager interviewing me now holds his hand over the notes and says to the note taker hold on a minute before he has a chance to write what i have just said i am getting angry and upset because he wont allow this to be written down i tell him that if he doesnt allow this to be written down i will leave the meeting right now and go to our head office on the other side of the city to explain the whole thing to them he eventually allows what i have said to be written down before i have a chance to say anything else he proclaims it is now pm and i am suspending this meeting he then leaves the room with no other explanation the guy taking notes is still in the room with me off the record he tells me he is also shocked at the way this meeting has been conducted he said he has never been told to stop writing after someone has said something we informally discuss the situation between ourselves minutes later the manager returns with a letter he has printed out he explains that he has escalated the matter to a disciplinary hearing in five days time there is no mention on the letter of the reason when i demand to know why he simply says the meeting is over i have nothing else to say flash forward five days later and i attend the disciplinary hearing with a different manager the reason given because i have arrived late for work on four occasions in the past months this is such a minor issue that this has never been mentioned to me before now all of the times i have arrived late have been because of public transport issues which are widely publicised after the event none of these have exceeded minutes on any occasion it happens to everyone but we dont make a big deal about it because unless you want to spend half your daily pay on car parking public transport is the only way to get here when i ask him about what happened in the other meeting he claims to know nothing about it and i need to speak to the other manager who conducted that interview this was three months ago and today i learn that the manager that conducted the investigation meeting has now left when i ask the reason why he left the person who told me just said well if he hadnt have left we would have made him leave the incident i experienced with him might have had an effect on his employment theres always a chance but i will never know
this is my first time posting so bear with me so i work in a bowling alley in minnesota usually its pretty calm only had to call the cops twice this being one of them and ive never had to personally kick anyone out this happened last night at about am a guy walked into the bar at about pm greg from here on out and ordered a few drinks from the bartender i work the front counter so i dont know how he acted inside the bar so i cant tell you much about him but i do know that by the time he left at about he was completely trashed the bartender comes into the bowling alley part and asks me to watch the bar for him while he goes out to smoke with the guy before he leaves its kind of a slow night so its no biggie i go in and watch the bar a few minutes later the bartender runs in and tells me to go on the speaker and call forward someone who drove a white escalade because their car was hit apparently greg hit a car while on his way out of the parking lot and sped away before the bartender could get his license plate number so i call them forward while the bartender calls the cops and tells them about the whole situation while were waiting for the cops the bartender gets an idea he goes into his past sales and looks up the name on the credit card greg used he uses this name to search facebook for greg he find his profile totally public and with a profile picture matching greg perfectly at around greg posted a status on facebook drinking at bowling alley and his timeline cover was a picture of the car used to hit the escalade the bartender starts going through his pictures and comes across a picture of that same car but from the front this time totally exposing the license plate number now we have a name a face a car model and a license plate number when the cop gets there the bartender gives him all this information the cop thanks him does all the cop stuff that i dont know about and now they are possibly were searching for that car trying to catch him and charge him with a dwi and a hit and run so this just goes to show dont post everything online or at least dont leave it public or do it just might do everyone a favor if you get into trouble and could possibly save a life

as ive mentioned before i work in a generic supply store located if a mildly ritzy area so its pretty natural that we receive a lot of self entitled customers so we get various different types of pricks but one that irritates me more than most is simply the lazy fuckers again these people are self entitled and lazy and they believe that low payed retail employees are there to answer to their every beck and call so we occasionally get these customers that will just hand us a scrap of paper with a few things scrawled on it and they expect us to do there shopping for them out of the lot of them there was this one particular woman who would come in and give us this stunt she was a fairly regular customer so i had learned to avoid her whenever she came shes one of those customers we just sorta shirk off onto the new guys and let them deal with her however one night several months ago here she comes in well call her lazy womanlw with the same smug look on her face as always however it had been quite the day and my normally pleasant facade was pretty much nonexistent it was nothing personal it had just been a very long shift with several annoying customers and i had just been worn thin so anyways its probably or minutes to close when lw comes in at this point at night im not thinking to hard so i just approach her uclockworkundertaker hi maam anything we can help you find tonight lw im looking for product x uclockworkundertaker thats gonna be on aisle maam your right hand side halfway down lw thats nice ill wait here while you go get that for me she then proceeds to start fooling with here phone this was pretty much breaking point for me i had been there for close to hours i had been dealing with crazy customers all day and i really didnt want to be made into this self entitled bitcheswell bitch so i gave her my condescending go fuck yourself look and told her uclockworkundertaker umyeah no go get it yourself lw excuse me uclockworkundertaker you got working limbs get it your damn self lw well i nevershe got pretty pissed pretty quick shes is already beat red here i demand to see your manager uclockworkundertaker certainly hey manager comer m hi ma gets cut off lw your employee said tm cuts her off m maam im well aware of what just happened i saw the whole thing lw well arent you gonna do something about it m yes i am actually maam leave my store l eh but m maam the store is closed now and i want you off the premises immediately at this point i should point out that this particular manager is about and probably weighs close to pounds this is a big dude and the bitch in question if at the most and in her late s not a lot she can really do against him she gives the both of us a look to kill and leaves the store the manager begins to laugh his ass off the tale eventually made its way back around to the store manager himself who told all of us that in an event like that were simply to walk away and leave the customer standing there the point of the story is that employees arent your personal servants theyre normal people who work a minimum wage job and honestly dont give a shit about you your needs leave them alone ask a question get your shit and get out if you really need help we are more than happy to oblige but dont be a total prick about it cause angry minimum wage employees can make you really miserable
ive been working at a movie theater for about months now and i just got a customer worth posting about one day an elderly lady came in with her daughter and two grandchildren they bought tickets to a d movie and of course i double checked saying this showing will be in d is that okay after saying yes they proceeded into their movie after about minutes the grandmother came back out to the lobby and asked why the screen is blurry confused on why no one had come out to complain earlier i asked if she ha been wearing her d glasses as im sure you know without the glasses it just looks blurry she said no because she didnt want to wear them i explained that the movie will be blurry if she doesnt wear the glasses she said that its unacceptable to run a movie blurry and asked to speak to a manager i called a manager for her and he reiterated what i had said and offered her a refund on the ticket she refused and returned to her movie i went back to preparing for the next round of movies but she wasnt done with us quite yet she returned to the lobby demanding we turn the d off i told her i couldnt do that because the rest of the customers had paid to see the film in d she began to yell rather rude things to me which climaxed in her throwing her d glasses at me gathering her family and leaving the theater early i explained to my manager what happened in case she called to complain edit i was dumb and didnt actually know how d worked
the customer walked in i smiled and said good morning and he just stared at me so that was my indication he wasnt going to be very pleasant when he came through my line a few minutes later with a couple small items he proved my theory to be true gtme is that everything for you gtgrumpy stares at me gtme okay would like a bag for it gtgrumpy no gtme alrighty your total is xxxx he pays and i go to hand him his receipt gtgrumpy blank stare wheres my bag gtme you said you didnt want one gtgrumpy well i changed my mind gtme well you never told me so i didnt know i bagged his items and wished him a good day and he left mumbling something about incompetent women sigh
so i may cry i was minutes into typing this post up when a power surge hit and every thing at work went down including the computer and now i have to type this again that in itself may become another post disclaimer standard stuff first time post massive wall of text etc background i work at a small privately owned retro game store you name it i have something for it now this tale takes place a few days after gta came out you see on this slow day at work i was killing time doing what i usually do playing snes games on one of our displays on the rare occasion when a customer would come in id pause my game greet them and offer whatever help i could provide then make my way to sit in front of the computer that doubles as our register and browse the internet while people wander around the store now it had been an hour or so since i had last had anyone in the store so i was itching to sell something when mom and kid came in i jumped up and gave them my spiel and they assured me they were fine and were just looking well a few minutes go by when kid and mom come up to me with you guessed it gta in hand kid has that look of pure bliss on his face the one where you just know he is envisioning the future just minutes away from him where he has popped that brand new game into his and is merrily running over civillians and blowing them apart with every weapon under the sun except there is one thing between him and that future a fell and powerful guardian that would be me i should take this time to mention that for the most part i dont like telling people they cant buy something it is sad not only because im missing out on a sale but im also a gamer and it sucks when you get that happy feeling of having a new game or system and its ripped away from you your card was declined you have to be or older to buy this etc are phrases i dislike except in some cases when they are the sweetest things in the world for you the entitled the bratty the liars the assholes the pricks the scammers the schemers etc to you i find those words delicious and oh so damn good you just know its fattening back to the story so whenever a minor or someone that looks like a minor tries to buy a m rated game i am required by law to ask for an id or get verbal guardian approval before the sale can happen now most parents fall into one of two general categories the i dont care i just pay for the damn thing and assume every thing is okay now take my money type and the im actually have an idea about what is going on here and im totally cool with it now take my money type those are the ones that just say yes and having done my duty and covering my ass legally i move on and make the sale not mom no when i tell her about the m rating she actually stops and asks me why its m rated my heart stopped i heard choirs and bells and that little tone we all know and love when mario picks up a coin this honestly never happens ive worked at this job for nearly four years and it is safe to say less than twenty to thirty people have actually asked to be informed kids heart drops at this but you can still see hope in his eyes hiding right there behind the fear as he turns to me and every part of his body language is just screaming dudebe cool nope i like my job and i like to think i do it well im paid to play and talk about games from the atari on up to the ps and xbox one afterall so when someone asks me about a game im going to tell you every thing about it and thats just what mom gets first blow language moms approval doesnt take any visible damage kid is optimisitc and reassures mom he is mature enough to handle it quick second punch drugs and alcohol i think i saw a grimacebut mom recovers quickly kid again whispering assurances and praise in her ear like wormtongue in lotr im getting serious now violence finally a crack in the armor mom starts to show some concern and wants to make sure kid reallly wants this game and can handle it kid puts on his most mature look i swear if he had a tux monocle and top hat he would have magically donned them at this point to complete the illusion he does he can he could pay the damn mortgage right now hes that mature youre doing well in keeping the situation favorable kid but i have a secret weapon nudity yep as some of you know gta didnt get the partial nudity rating that could qualify as anything from some exposed ankle to side boob nope now this is what kid feared was coming and hoped i either didnt know or wasnt going to share it but i did critical hit tko mom was out she refused to get it and told kid he wasnt going anywhere near that game until he was old enough i thought that was the end of it but damn kid was quick on his feet he played the friends already have it card followed quickly by dad will be okay with it call him so she stepped out of the store for a moment to call dad and tell him meanwhile im left in the store getting the most venomhatespiterage filled look ive seen seriously i think if looks could kill this one would have done a number on me not that quick and easy kill me on the spot stuff oh no i mean slow and painful years of torture kind well mom comes back in and is on the fence again apparently dad wasnt against it but she still was im given the phone and asked to tell him exactly what i told her and i do and mom gets the phone back this time she stays in the store and i must have convinced dad because this time she hangs up and tells kid he is not getting the game reddit let me tell you i have seen some tantrums explosions complete personality turn arounds etc in my time but damn kid takes the cake all illusion of maturity flies out the window as he plays every cliche trick in the book he screams he threatens he cries he begs every thing i would love to go into detail about exactly what transpired here but it was a while back and he went on for nearly minutes so ill just give you my three favorite parts because i can remember those nearly verbatim favorite kid is in that state where he transitions from rage to bawling seamlessly but is sniffling and snotting and generally grossing me out the entire rampage why is this hilarious because while doing all this he is telling mom that he is mature enough to handle the game and that the nudity isnt even a main part of it and he wont look at it and he doesnt have to do it etc except it actually is a main part for at least one story mission so yeah also the tantrum technique not exactly the best when trying to claim you are old enough for something favorite the xxx has it so screw you ill just play it there now kudos to mom she handled this like a pro her response you wont when i call every one of your friends parents and tell them you are not to be any where near that game im also going to ask them if they know exactly what their kids are playing favorite this one was just stupid which made it all the more pathetic and hilarious kid yells at mom telling her he doesnt need her and hell just come back and buy the game in a few days himself mom not fazed or even looking at me asks me if he could buy it without her to help her get her point across i ask if he is she assures me he isnt and i tell them that without an id proving he is or older no one can legally sell him that game the night ends with her dragging his bawling snot dripping raging ass out of my store apologizing profusely for his antics and before they get out of earshot i can hear her list off the loooooooong list of punishments hes going to recieve after his behavior reddit i love moments like that it had it all drama laughter lies betrayal threats crying bargaining and a parent actually acting like a parent oh and kid was about by the way be honest you all thought he was didnt you ive got years of tales piled up if you want more tldr you guys are cheatingfine kid pitches mom refuses to catch

a while back when i was sixteen i had taken a job at a local grocery store i lived in a small town and even through the store was quite small it was the largest one in the county i had nearly worked for two months at the local grocery store when this occurrence had happened i was nearing the end of my shift on a saturday afternoon it hadnt been a particularly day despite it being a weekend and i can recall myself quite bored when the old man walked into the store the old man whos name i will change for the sake of the story to david had been a regular customer spending a few hundred dollars a week he was usually upbeat and enthusiastic but today he was distant and fatigued how are you doing sir i asked from behind the counter ok its been a long day david replied without his usual cheer he then shuffled away into the aisles minutes passed and i waited patiently in the seat which was positioned behind the cash register but after awhile i went to look for him to see if he needed any assistance i searched the store caressing overstocked aisles with a looking eye when i finally found him in the far right corner looking at the outdoors merchandise we carried which consisted of rope a few cheap tents bug spray and various other things youd need to bring for a typical night of camping david had a cheep twelve pack of beer in one hand and was the examining the different ropes with another hello david i said the store staff were quite friendly with the old man or at least enough that we called him by his first name do you need help with anything which rope do you think is the strongest there were only four different of rope and i honestly had completely no clue which one was the most durable so i picked at random pointing at a blue one then he gave me a measurement and i cut the certain length then took the rope to the cash register so he could pay david followed slowly a mopish jaunt the receipt took a while to print the printer was old and dawdling and so after i had scanned the rope and beer i tried to converse with david i looked at the rope and the weary expression on the old mans face are you sure everything is ok could be better could be worse david said with stale tone alright then i said smilingheres your receipt as he walked out of the store i went to my manager i told him of the recent occurrence and he was slightly concerned david was a regular customer spent a lot of money in the store and also was the owners good friend so due to the fact that david lived about a block away the manager had the bright idea of sending me out to monitor the old man i protested at first but gave when i realized that id be basically getting paid to watch a house but what i could possibly do to prevent a suicide was beyond me i walked out of the store with a hoodie on it was nearing spring but it was still brisk outside my breath misted faintly in the air i walked down the street trailing david feeling like a total moron fortunately i had an mp player in my pocket so i could listen to music while doing my detective research after two corners davids house was in sight and i decided to wait it out on a bench in front of a auto store about yards away from the shabby twostory house ten minutes passed without anything eventful then fifteen minutes twenty minutes but after about maybe minutes i saw david the old mans backyard was surrounded by a tall wooden fence and had a huge branched oak tree in the middle david was ambling up the trees broad branches with the blue rope coiled around his arm when he reached the middle branch he stopped and tied an end of the rope around it in a wide knot he then descended back down the oak and disappeared behind the wooden fence another bout of minutes passed i felt a nervous twinge of expected excitement in my chest the rope glared at me like an impending doom the afternoon sun was setting and it loomed over davids house with a glaring tint i had to squint my eyes at the house and even then it was hard to see the sun continued to decline it grew colder and i grew more jittery with every moment the blue rope swayed in a slight breeze finally a figure appeared two figures actually to stand on top of the fence frame one the slime frame of a young girl the other of the old man david had the rope held in his hand but quickly put it around the girlsneck i couldnt tell with the distance but the way the girl was shaking shrieked of approaching disaster was david hanging a child i stood up abruptly yanking out my ear buds with a contorted twist of my hand and began to amble toward the house everything was as if it was in slow motion my feet speeding forward faster than i ever think theyve gone before david shoving the girl of the top of the fence connected to the rope tied to the branch of the oak tree holy hell i shouted a scream sounded from the other side of the fence and the rope went slack i scaled the wooden fence with an untapped agility landing on the other side with a heavy thud i once again stood up scanning the grass lawn with ninjalike eyes there was david standing on top of the fence smiling down at the frame of the girl whoheld the slender blue rope in her hands two other girls were standing underneath the tree yelling words of encouragement but they stopped abruptly when they saw the sight of me a hooded teenager with eyes pulsing with adrenaline i stared at them awkwardly then turned to david and apologized profusely it turns out those were his grand kids and he was caring for them for the weekend the reason he had looked so distant and fatigued was because well he had been caring for three grand kids for the weekend the rope was used for a rope swing to entertain his granddaughters after i told why i had so unexpectedly appeared in his back lawn he laughed almost as profusely as i had apologized it became a joke between us and the store and the story was told for years afterward
i worked in the deli for a major supermarket in canada for a few years one very important thing we had to do hourly was temperature checks food in the hot case had to be at or above a certain temperature and could only be out for a set number of hours ive got quick stories about new girls i had the pleasure of training training a cute girl who didnt seem too bright but theres not much to the frying chicken business anyway she was going to school to be an rn psw so i figured shed be on board with safety and keeping records accurate temperature logs nope she claimed to be dyslexic and as such couldnt read an analog clock and keeping logs were an issue red flag for food safety super red flag for getting the right dosage of medicine also we had to spice raw whole chickens stick them on racks and throw them in an oven this was too gross for her and she wasnt going to do it not sure if she got the part in her psw class about elderly care and gross things one will need to doclean she didnt make it to the end of the week we hired another rightoutofhighschool girl to replace her this was her first job but she was taking in everything asking the right questions and taking notes i told her about the girl who couldnt read an analog clock well this girl couldnt read an analog clock either but didnt say anything to me at the time i only found out a few days later that she went home and spent a few hours with her mom learning how to do so that was cool of her not to just give up kids these days man

background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax on the th of july and new years eve story i had a customer call a month ago to complain about some fireworks the customer was hearingimpaired and the call was being conducted through a tdd device using an operator if youve never communicated over a tdd through an operator it can be exasperating and i feel terrible for the hearing impaired people who have to use one basically you tell the operator whatever youd like to say making sure to speak slowly the operator types your end of the conversation on a keyboard and then sends it to the hearing impaired user the user then reads the message types in their reply and sends it back to the operator the operator then reads the reply back to you sometimes it can take minute or two for all this to happen so youre basically saying a couple of sentences or asking a question waiting for a minute or two to hear the reply and then speaking again its like having a conversation in slow motion with someone on the moon apparently the caller had purchased some fireworks from me in june and was mad because some of them didnt work i give an unconditional money back guarantee on everything i sell and i always feel terrible when someone has issues with my stuff i apologized profusely and since my store is seasonal and had already closed i offered to send him a check to refund his purchase normally id want to see a receipt or have them bring back the duds but because of the tdd wed already been on the phone for more than minutes at that point i felt bad for the guy and just wanted to finish the call and make him happy two minutes later tdd delay unfortunately that wasnt the answer he was looking for instead he wanted me to replace his fireworks i offered to meet him somewhere and bring him replacements two minutes later i was informed that he lived an hour away and couldnt get over to orlando instead he wanted me to mail him the fireworks now fireworks are considered hazardous materials and cant be shipped through the regular mail because of the expense and problems associated with this i dont ship fireworks i let him know that and again offered to send him a check to cover the duds two minutes later i was again told that i needed to mail him fireworks since i had a guarantee and the fireworks he had purchased were bad once again i explained to the operator that i didnt mail fireworks but that id be happy to send a check two minutes later hes now really mad at me and yelling that i can send him a check and hell go to another fireworks company to get his stuff i only know that he was yelling because the tdd operator informed me that he was typing emphatically thats righti was being yelled at by a hearing impaired person over the phone through an operator translating the call i asked him to give me a list of exactly what fireworks were duds so i could figure out the cost and mail him a check i also told him that i would need his home address two minutes later its a box of firecrackers a fcking box of firecrackers i had now spent minutes on the phone because this ass was unhappy that some of the firecrackers in his pack did not pop more than two months after he had purchased them i immediately sent him a check for through online banking i filled out the note field on the check it read please shop somewhere else unfortunately it can take up to days for the check to arrive when its a new entry online the bastard called me back every day until he got the check when the tdd operator would identify themselves i would just say the check is in the mail and hang up if youre interested ive posted a few other stories 
alright so kids are very annoying when it comes to checking out always in the way blocking the sensor climbing on the bag spinner thing im always afraid im going to hit one of them in the head with it and guess what i finally did this young boy did everything i described above and more however he was also leaning into the thing that the bags are on that i spin towards the customers i did not see him there being obnoxious and i spun it so i could move on to the next bag and it hit him in the head holy crap my heart just about stopped as i thought to myself that i was in a shit ton of trouble right there the parents however surprised me by telling him it was his own fault and that he needs to get out of my way oh that made my day
so im at work at my auto part store trying my bstt not to kill the many idiots that we get so this lady comes in yo the store well she was dressed like a lady but you could tell it was a guy in drag now we dont get many people like that but i have had a few run ins so im not really surprised or even care so she comes up to the counter and asks for some power steering fluid i go and grab it for her and ring it up she then asks me if i could help put the fluid in for her and i said sure why not so we go to the car and while im opening up the hood we make small talk right when i finish she takes out a bill and tries to give it to me i tell her i cant accept tips but if she did that customer survey it would help me out more she agrees and then asks why i treated her normal i get what she meant and i just tell her honestly i dont care how you look maam we all deserve to be treated the same no matter how you look she thanked me and gave me a hug which felt weird cause i dont usually get hugs from strangers and then she just puts the in my shirt pocket and leaves it made me feel happy knowing that i made her day by just being casual my coworker then asked me if that was a dude and i just responded with it doesnt matter all customers look the same to me and smiled and with that i felt good and made today a good day until seconds later i get another idiot trying to buy washer fluid to put in his radiator
i was just a normal customer in this situation but found it to be annoying none the less today my fiance and i got breakfast and studied at a popular bread cafe in town while we were in line waiting to order there was an old lady in front of us demanding her money back because drumroll she thought it was too cold in the restaurant she was holding an empty cup that was clearly meant for a frozen drink and berated the manager for the temperature claiming that she couldnt even sit in there long enough to finish her drink because of how chilly it was a younger woman either daughter or granddaughter im guessing came up to her and told her they were ready and were going to the car to which the woman responded wait a minute im getting my money back for this drink clearly she did finish her drink and had been there with her family for quite a while not only did the manager refund her money but he also turned the heat up in the restaurant long after she was gone it was still roasting inside i couldnt help but laugh later when a customer sitting at a nearby table looked over to us and asked is it toasty in here to you
this happened a few years back when i used to manage a small grooming salon we had one customer who i hated she was a terrifying tiny elderly lady who owned a little dog every frikkin time she called to make a booking to get her dog groomed the times available were never to her liking and she would throw a tantrum like a three year old until we just gave up and let her have her own damn way well one day she called up and i ended up completely rearranging the entire days schedule to suit her sorry butt i was none too pleased and consequently renamed her haggis in the booking system anywho her appointment time comes and goes and haggis doesnt show up im infuriated a coworker asks me where she is and i spit maybe shes dead and her dog has devoured her corpse coworker tells me im morbid and horrible and we forget about it fast forward a week later and i recieve a phone call from my coworker shes upset with me apparently haggis family had come into the shop with sad news haggis had passed away and my coworker being the superstitious person she was believed i had somehow cursed her the only curse here is my big fat mouth and awful sense of humour 
so this happened today before i left work guy comes in and starts taking a bunch of tools i mean this dude was not being subtle so i came up to him asking if he was ready to pay for those parts and just bolts to the door making the alarm go off now at that moment when he was stealing two cops show up and are heading toward the store the shoplifter gets to the door and sees the cops and just stays frozen there i come out and tell the cops that he was shoplifting they grab him and searched him they find about worth of stuff they arrest him and put him the patrol car man talk about having the worst timing ever

sorry in advance for formatting im on my phone i work in a popular asian market in a trendy area that tends to somehow cater to middle aged white ladies who want to buy asian inspired trinkets and ingredients to look more cultured because of this everything is a lot more like a grocery store youd find in the us and its heavily aimed at our caucasian customer base short of the actual products we sell but hey its a good job this takes place months ago we have a strict policy when it comes to cash back customers must write their initials near the cash back amount in the receipt after receiving their money this way we make sure they got their cash and if they come back complaining they didnt get it we can look at the receipt and see if they initialed or not instead of recounting tills in the middle of the day seems simple enough right not to this paranoid customer who will be called pc pc comes through my line we exchange greetings everything is normal and easy i bag his groceries and tell him his total he uses debit and requests cash back no biggie i print the receipt and hand him his cash place the receipt on the counter and hand him a pen giving my usual spiel gtme and if you could please initial your receipt anywhere around here circles cash back amount on receipt gtpc with sudden unexplained anger no gtme uhh what thinking he maybe misheard me i repeat myself could you please initial your receipt for cash back gtpc im not doing that im not legally required to give you my information gtme uhh dont worry youll keep the receipt i just need you to initial it so i know you got the money gtpc nope im not signing anything reaches for receipt gtme pulls it away sorry then youre not getting your receipt at this point the customers next in line are paying attention to our ridiculous argument i feel a little like a parent trying to get a kid to behave in public gtme lays receipt back on counter points to where i circled earlier please just initial here and you can keep the receipt to that pc quickly snatched the paper from my hands barked out a frustrated no and rushed out the door as quickly as possible i shouted some weak comment from my register about it being against policy as he walked out but it fell short oh well he never came back saying he didnt have the cash so i guess it all worked out he can peacefully have his receipt knowing that he didnt have to give me his valuable information by initialing it and then taking it with him
at my store we had those high by thick steel pylons to prevent people driving vehicles into the storefront what they dont realize is that those things are sunk about four feet into the ground and are filled with concrete as well as surrounded by concrete i think we had about eight of them and theyre painted bright yellow of course well early one sunday morning some fucknut decided that he was going to back his truck into the store at speed and steal a bunch of shit we were closed on sundays so nobody noticed because he didnt even manage to set off the glass sensors monday morning cue hilarity i walk up and see that one of the pylons is bent pretty bad clock in and see that all the managers are there laughing about something i go to see whats so funny and am treated to this on video guy pulls into the parking lot lines up his truck and floors it backwards toward the store he centerpunches one of the pylons and his truck is popped up stopped and caught by it he cant get away fucked part is he had a toolbox and managed to take his bumper off throw it in the bed of his truck get his truck off the pylon and vacate before a patrol car came around it took him an hour and a half never caught him but that video was hilarious
hey tfr i worked at a well known pet supply chain and this is one of the few good stories that i have to tell so one of our regular customers was an elderly lady who happened to be the mother of a severely autistic young man well call him johnny johnny was well known in the store for having meltdowns where he would just sit down on the floor curl up into a tight ball and refuse to move he never got violent he just sat and sometimes cried i loved johnny he was the sweetest thing and his mother was always so kind on this particular day i was working customer service so i was running around doing price checks carry outs etc i was standing at the front waiting on a woman nl for nice lady to finish paying so that i could help her out to her car enter johnny and his mom they walk through our first set of sliding doors no problem but johnny is a little distracted by this dvd he has in his hands he then proceeds to sit down in the middle of our second set of sliding doors blocking the way his mom is doing everything she can to move johnny but he just wont budge he is so enthralled by the dvd in his hands that he has completely shut down to everyone i see johnny doing this and i also see the massive line of people trying to get out the front door but with a cart there is just no way around him i politely tell nl that i will help her carry out her groceries if she will give me just a minute to handle the situation she smiles politely and says no problem so i head over to the doors i sat down next to johnny and i got tons of death glares from the angry pet parents trying so desperately to leave the store me hey johnny whatcha got there is that a new dvd johnny i love lucy me oh my gosh i love lucy too did your mom buy you that new i love lucy movie johnny mhm i love lucy me you know what so do i but hey i have some awesome news for you johnny just kind of stared at the dvd packaging me we got some new cats in the adoption center why dont you ask your mom if you can go look at them they are super cute and one of them will even lick your hand at this point johnnys face absolutely lights up and he got the biggest smile on his face he didnt say anything but he just hopped up and ran over to his mom who in turn gave me the biggest most exhausted smile i have ever seen she nodded her head in thanks then went about her shopping with a happy johnny in tow nl apparently had watched the whole situation go down as i was helping her out to her car she couldnt stop commending me for how i handled the situation after i finished unloading her groceries she tried to tip me i was so surprised that i almost started crying but i just told her very politely that i couldnt accept tips but thank you so much for the kindness that was the best day i think i might have ever had working at that stupid pet store edit oh my gosh thank you guys and thank you person who gave me gold i gots the fuzzies in my tummy from all your guys responses 
ive only had this happen twice in the three years ive worked in fast food yesterday and a couple months back basically one customer asked if he could pay for the car behind him at drive through assuming he knew the next customer i agreed and thought nothing of it when the next car got to the window the woman attempted to pay so i explained to her that the car in front of her already had she was confused asking who they were or why they had done it realizing that it wasnt someone she knew i explained how once in a great while someone will come through and offer to pay for the person behind them as a nice gesture the woman looked like she was about to cry she had the biggest smile on her face after gushing over what a great person they were for a bit she asked if she could do the same for the car behind her the pay it forward line lasted for the rest of the cars in drive through about people payed for the person behind them some of the orders were double the price of theirs yet no one hesitated to pay it it made he rest of my night just wanted to share with you guys edit for those of you asking the th car was the last in line so he had no one to pay for before paying he actually offered but glanced behind him and realized no one was there he goes well i guess i win then thought it was funny

part since the wonderful folks in this sub warned me against making the cake itself half chocolate i decided to make the little girl a free chocolate cupcake instead however this posed new problems how to give it to the little girl without making it seem like charity plus how to decrease the chances of the mom throwing the cupcake out if i just coincidentally had a chocolate cupcake made specially for the little girl it would be suspicious so i made two cupcakes one chocolate one vanilla under the guise that we just keep a bunch of single cupcakes made for birthday kids we dont fast forward to this morning mom and kiddo walk in around the little girl is absolutely beaming from ear to ear but completely wellbehaved i bring their cake out and get an unenthusiastic response from mom my decorating skills are top notch lady but as soon as the little girl saw her cake she gave a little shoutgiggle and clapped her hands as kids do mom takes the cake and the moment of truth begins gtme hold on is this the birthday girl gtlittle girl giggles and nods gtme oh well then let me get your cupcake all the birthday kids get a special cupcake if they come in to pick up their cake gti duck into the back and grab the two cupcakes gtme would you like chocolate or vanilla gtlittle girl chocolate please takes cupcake thank you gtmom ill hold onto that you can have it with your dinner its too early for cake lets go ive probably set myself up for this lady coming in a year from now expecting another free cupcake for her kid but for nowsuccess
i think most grocery stores have some sort of loyalty system discounts off off extra points if you spend over that kind of thing our store also has its own line of mastercards with the loyalty system being a major drive its a credit card and a loyalty card you sign up for one of the credit cards you get off your grocery bill seems straightforward yeah well no a japanese couple jc come to my register with a cart of groceries and theyre waving one of these mastercard coupons in my face their bill came up at they were expecting to only pay i ask them for their card and they pull out their regular loyalty card oh boy me okay you need the mastercard for this to work for you points at the card on the coupon do you have the card they wave their regular card at me okay a language barrier i normally hate talking to foreign people like they dont understand but its clear jc has no clue what im on about they back and forth speak japanese to each other and keep pointing at the coupon i repeatedly tell them it wont work without the mastercard and point at the card they start yelling at me in japanese but i dont budge me sorry you dont have the card so you cant get off jc no me no sorry they dont have they have they cant afford the groceries so i offer to take something off for them theyre not having any of that the husband grabs the cart comes around to my side of the register and shoves it at me full speed and then grabs the lb bag of rice and throws that at me he then slams the coupon down on the counter and yells full blast in japanese it was a kneejerk reaction but i managed to shove him back and scream no get out and pointed at the door i always get antsy when anyone apart from children come around to my side of the register and this is partly why kids mostly just want their candy early or they want to scan something which im fine with adults though no my space jc yelling in japanese me get out now out go g and s the managers on duty came running and the customers were eventually told to get out and were banned the managers made it perfectly clear to them what the consequences would be if they ever came back im alright i managed to catch the bag but when i dropped it it split lbs of rice everywhere on the fucking floor the worst ill have is bruises from where the cart hit me the managers sided with me and realized i screamed because i was scared incident reports done but honestly i dont think anything else will be done apart from an indefinite ban im all for foreigners but make an attempt to learn basic english if not for your sake for the citizens sake jesus tldr language barrier ended violently my throats still sore from screaming
ive been working at a small local skate shop for about a month now today a woman came in asking if we carried sweatshirts we do and they were right in front of her i pointed them out and helped her pick out a color she liked when she was done looking around i went to the register to ring her up she paid with a card and tried to swipe it on the chipreading pin pad we keep on the counter im sorry i said since you dont have a chip card im going to have to slide your card myself unbothered she handed over her card i swiped it handed it back and asked her to sign our clover register screen she was utterly confused by the screen which most people know to sign with their finger do you have a pen she asked while attempting to sign with the corner of her credit card then she stopped mumbled something about credit card fraud and announced shed like to pay with cash by this point her card had already gone through but since she refused to sign i couldnt complete the transaction solving this was a bit difficult and i had to call over my boss he was forced to print a receipt for the transaction then go back issue a refund and print another receipt he became visibly frustrated when the woman insisted wed charged her twice i have two receipts you charged me twice no maam said my boss one receipt is for the items you bought the other shows that we refunded you for them after about five more minutes of explaining that she hadnt been charged twice for her damn things the woman pushed her bag back over the counter folded her arms and said you know what i dont want this after all this is too much of a hassle then hurried out in a huff

i was that this should be something i should post here when i was a teenager back in the s i worked at a department store an old famous one familiar to canadian readers as one of those annoying would you like a store credit card people who used to walk the aisles but not the carpeted areas as that was off limits one day during the week i had the job fired for not doing it well i spotted a gentleman walking through the mens clothing section who was always looking at the ceiling specifically he seemed to be looking at the security cameras he disappeared behind a post where the socksunderwear were sold and came out with his jacket buttoned all the way up he was still glancing around i immediately walked over to the security guard nearby and said that i saw someone that looked like they were shoplifting as i was explaining what i saw i could see the gentleman heading towards the exit to the rest of the mall i said thats the guy hes got the stuff under his jacket the security guard didnt see him but got on his walkietalkie and said something like suspect is heading towards exit b suddenly the shoplifter started walking faster towards the exit as did the security guard they both arrived at about the same time and then stopped the security guard turned to me and said what does he look like is he still in here i said thats the guy right there the shoplifter then took out his earpiece that was connected to his walkietalkie and said who what guy yup i had been watching an undercover security guard the entire time when they figured out what happened they both laughed pretty hard they legitimately thanked me for helping them and said not to worry about it
just found this sub and read pages and pages of stories that brought me back my tour of duty was with two major big box stores and all my time was spent in lp i never really had to deal with customers for the most part unless they were stealing or injured i always wore plain clothes so customers didnt know who i was but i can still relate with most of the stories on here these are the most memorable moments i can think of off the top of my head for about six to eight months we had someone that would come in and shit on the sales floor wipe their ass with merchandise and vanish we had no idea who was doing it because it was happening all over the store we eventually referred to the person as the shitter every other week an associate or customers would randomly find a massive pile of shit on the sales floor we would try to review the surveillance footage but were never able to determine who did it the sales floor never had a clue because they never left the register bays i felt so bad for our housekeeping staff because they were the ones that had to clean it up im pretty sure one of them quit because they were tired of it one day im walking the sales floor when i observed this guy looking very suspicious i figured he was going to shoplift so i slowly made my way over towards him all of a sudden he ducks down behind a rounder so i figured he was concealing merchandise i walked around for a better vantage point when i saw this dude just straight shitting on the sales floor i immediately screamed out this guy is fucking shitting on the sales floor all the customers and associates in the area immediately look over in the course of pulling his pants up in midshit he managed to shit all over himself as he was pulling them up i will never be able to shake that from my memory he just grabs a hold of his pants which he didnt even have time to button and makes a break for the doors hes running into everything and knocking fixtures over i following him out the door and yell at him never to come back and that was the end of the shitter saga we were watching this teenage boy alone in the lingerie department feeling up the mannequins he literally groped every single one and then darted towards the bathroom the other lp agent that i was working with who was fairly new says im gonna go see what hes doing in there and bolts out of the camera room i knew damn well what was happening in the bathroom im sitting on the camera and i see the kid scurry out of the bathroom area and book it out the mall entrance the lp agent says hes going the check the bathroom which was fairly large so i start making my way up there as i am going up the escalator he yells over the radio he jerked off in the handicapped bathroom i was instantly heartbroken because that was my favorite stall to use it was tucked away in the back and it was my little sanctuary when i wanted to get away for a while i had to see the carnage for myself and walked in there was semen everywhere on the toilet in the sink it was a massacre i never used that stall again our store was notorious for grab and runners vehicle would pull up to the door people would pile out of the car run in grab as much merchandise as they could near the entrance run out and get in the car one day another agent is coming into the lp office and says theres some crack head near the door that looks like shes going to do a grab and run sure enough we pull up the cameras and see her grab two arm loads of designer brand handbags and start making her way towards the doors our office door was right next to the entrance where she was standing so were piled up behind the door as im watching through the peephole as soon as she hits the doors we go out after her we instantly grab her in the vestibule and the fight is on it must have looked like the tasmanian devil just spinning around in there with limbs and handbags flying everywhere of course everyone just stood around and watched as we fought with her all of a sudden i feel my pant leg is wet so i look down and see shes pissed herself and its on me and the other agent with everything i had we got her handcuffed threw her into the office and hauled ass into the mens department we start frantically grabbing whatever clothes we could get our hands on and ran into the bathroom to wash ourselves off and change turns out that the clothes that we wore had to be damaged out since we obviously could wear our pisssoaked clothes were more expensive than the handbags so the company ended up losing money on that one lol i just noticed my first three stories all had to do with bodily functions we had a girl shoplifting inside the fitting room so our female agent was in there waiting to check the stall when she came out to see what was missing the girl exited the store so i followed behind her the female agent was taking forever to get back to me and the girl was displaying nervous indicators so i took a gamble and stopped her before i had confirmed with the agent that she stole as soon as i idd myself she took off running through the parking lot and the chase was on im yelling on the radio telling the agent that im chasing her on foot to get her ass out of the store i literally chased this girl halfway around the outside of the mall as were running i see theres a car parked in the middle of the street and shes running right for it she gets up to the passenger side of the vehicle so i block the door instead of grabbing her because i thought she was going to get in the car she bolts away from the car and i tackle her in a last ditch effort i just get her handcuffed when i look over at the car and see the driver has gotten out of the car and is walking towards me holding a gun i jump right off of her start to back away and say you can have the bitch the guy doesnt say a word gets back in his car and leaves at this time my backup finally gets there i pass the shoplifter off to them and we start walking back to the store as we get to the store i tell the rest of the staff that i am going to stay outside for a minute to catch my breath next thing i know i opened my eyes inside an ambulance apparently i passed out on the sidewalk and some customers called i get to the hospital and all the cops that i know are coming in to check on me all of a sudden one of the cops says i think your girl is faking it i was like huh he goes yeah the shoplifter and points across the emergency room come to find out when they took the shoplifter inside the store she passed out as well and they had to call another ambulance for her i look over and there she is laying in a bed right across from me we started yelling obscenities back and forth to each other and they had to move her to the opposite side of the er heres some other random stuff that ill just get right to the point of because im getting pretty tired of typing i had two customers that died on the sales floor while waiting on their wives who were shopping inside the store what a miserable way to go heart attacks i once fought a transvestite that had a razor blade in hisher mouth and tried to spray us with bear mace i cant count the number of times i saw parents take their babies in a stroller on escalators and the strollers have gone tumbling down the escalator seriously fuck you if you take your kid in a stroller on the escalator dont ever pick up a pile of clothes off the fitting room floor because chances are someone has pissed on them people fuck in fitting rooms a lot the womens bathrooms are wayyyy more disgusting than the mens bathroom i cant tell you the number of times i saw diarrhea sprayed all over the toilet walls and floors in the womens bathroom when were checking for customers at the end of the night not to mention all the bloody toilet seats bloody andor shitty underware left behind and tampons just thrown about fucking gross ill never forget there was a report of a fire on the second floor so we all booked it towards the area where the fire was i was running past a certain cosmetic line counter and there was this girl that i was absolutely in love with when all of a sudden i tripped fell and landed right at her feet hard as hell i had my radio in my hand and used that to break my fall the radio exploded when it hit the floor and shattered into a million pieces i never walked by her again i never let a sales associate get verbally abused by a customer and was quick to kick customers out of the store if they started to get loud with an employee im sure theres tons more stories that i cant think of right now ive been out since and have yet to step foot back inside a mall for any reason its a nice feeling to be able to look forward to holidays now instead of dreading them keep fighting the good fight and dont take shit from anyone literally tldr fuck retail

background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square foot of fireworks heaven story i got a phone call from a guy asking about our selection of fireworks he said he and his friends were putting on a little show and they were looking to pick up some good stuff we have a lot of customers that do the same thing theyll get together with friends or have a block party everyone will throw in some cash and theyll put on their own show i explained how we had everything they needed as well as videos of all the fireworks the guy says thanks and hangs up a few hours later three guys in their early s walked in and asked for me they looked pretty ragged with scraggly beards and camo pants but then again im selling explosives out of a tent in a parking lot i started showing them videos of our stuff and explained different effects and ways to put on a good show one of the guys asked for paper and a pen and would periodically scribble on the clipboard we gave him this went on for at least an hour i dont think the three of them combined said more than words the entire time afterward one of them told me thank you and they walked out the door it was pretty slow that day so guess it wasnt really a waste of my time but i was still a little weirded out by their behavior guess who walks back through the door an hour later i was actually helping someone else at the time so my dad went to take care of them it was like dj vu they spent another hour walking around watching videos then out the door again guess who walks back through the door an hour later i didnt actually see them come in but one of them walked past me carrying something in his hands while i was helping another customer im trying to pay attention to the person im helping but i can see these guys all walking around with their arms full and im wondering what the hell is going on i excuse myself and head to the front of the store when i get to the front im greeted by a replica of the great wall of china made entirely of fireworks these guys are grabbing sometimes or of each item and recreating one of the great wonders of the world at the front of my store im trying to help them but i swear to god these guys still arent saying words to me when the dust settles my store looks like its been ransacked im pretty sure they grabbed at least one or two of damn near everything i sell i honestly had two different cashiers ring them up on two registers at the same time just to get through the mountain of stuff we swapped out multiple pieces with full cases where we could the entire time the trio is just standing around watching us ring it and box it no small talk no chatter when i had to ask them a question id get a one or two word reply when we finished i let them know that i appreciated their business and since they had purchased so much i was going to give them a substantial discount to put it in perspective the discount was more than no smile no high five no victory dance just looked and me with a blank stare said thanks and paid in cash the story should end therebut it doesnt one of the three leaves and pulls around in an old cargo van it has bucket seats for both the driver and the passenger and a bench seat for the third guy immediately i realize that theres no way in hell theyre going to fit all of the fireworks in the van i went to offer assistance but they of course said no thanks at this point i think my entire staff was standing outside of the tent watching the of them play fireworks tetris after about minutes i think they caught on that it wasnt all going to fit the solutionremove the bench seat they asked if they could leave it and pick it up later and i happily said yes they finally get it loaded and i mean this thing is stuffed to the gills they had stacked the fireworks to the ceiling in back but had actually left a little space between the fireworks and the roof just behind the two bucket seats when they go to leave all three of them climb in the van the driver in the drivers seat the passenger in the passengers seat and the third person laying on top of the cases of fireworks as they drove away my dad summed it up perfectly dad if they get into a car accident on the way home the police arent going to find anything left of them bigger than a quarter ive posted a few other stories if youre interested
i wish i would have called in work today near the end of my shift my coworker came in and was asking me about signs for the garden shop where i was working today and noticed something in the parking lot asking if it was a person on the ground i sprinted outside to find a woman who had collapsed and had a heart attack laying faceup and not breathing i was the first one out there and immediately ran inside and got an ambulance on the way i sprinted back outside and blocked off the area while someone gave her cpr started talking to the womans granddaughter who was six years old off to the side while everyone did what they could to save the woman who was unresponsive not breathing and according to them had no heartbeat i just kept her granddaughter occupied the entire talking to her about school and her siblings and what not the look on the womans face was bad enough pale white with her eyes wide open but the granddaughter got me the most when she asked if mamaw was gonna be okay eventually the granddaughters mother arrived and picked her up and thanked me then drove off to follow the ambulance once it left they tried cpr again with an oxygen mask and also tried using a defibrillator but to no avail the last minutes of my shift were hard i couldnt stop thinking about how the little six year old girl probably just witnessed her grandma whom of which wasnt very old die i got home and told my parents about it but they seemed kind of disaffected about it like it wasnt a big deal im still not sure if i did the right thing or if there was more that i could do to help her im currently stressed out and confused right now it being finals week for my high school i really dont know what to feel right now edit i would like to thank everyone for all of their reassuring words on this matter i ended up going to bed extremely early and not being awake for when many of the messages and comments were sent but i assure you ive read them all now at am your words mean more than you think as for whoever gifted me gold as im not able to see who damn mobile reddit apps thank you as well even through thousands of karma this is my first gold ever party noises go off ill be sure to use it all in preparation for a better mindset for the whole thing which i may not have to try too hard already being consoled by hundreds of you caring people thank you all so much really
so where i work we have coupons out every week for x amount of a regular priced item or off your entire regular priced purchase i had this trio of folks come in consisting of two ladies and a man im helping one woman while my coworker is helping the couple the woman im helping is cheap lady the other is illiterate lady and the man is smart man so cl is trying to purchase a book and with every coupon it has the coupon fine print and restrictions which include copyright items like books magazines and dvds the book is and i immediately tell her the coupon wont apply to the book so we have the following back and forth me the coupon will come off all your jewellery but not the book due to it being copyrighted cl what where does it say that i didnt see that on the sale sign either i went to the display after we closed and sure enough it says it excludes the books proceeds to point it out on the coupon il what thats dumb who has time to sit there and read the fine print thats ridiculous me well just because people dont want to read it doesnt mean it isnt there or isnt valid at this point i was irritable and was having some home issues that i took with me to work which i know isnt fair but bah sm well that makes sense takes out his card and pays for his transaction while il gives me the stink eye cl well then i dont want the book if i cant use a coupon on it theres going to be a very sad little girl and its all your fault youre ruining her birthday so i just shrug take the book off and tell her the total she scowls the entire time while taking out the cash and completely ignores my outstretched hand placing it on the counter i smile get her change and place it on the counter she had manicure nails so she struggled to pick up the change i put her receipt in the bag and wish them a good night honestly just because you dont read a binding agreement or the fine print doesnt make it invalid

i was walking up to my place of employment a few minutes before we opened at am thus the parking lot is usually pretty empty i noticed a car coming my direction as i was walking into the crosswalk but they had a stop sign and seemed far enough away so i proceeded to cross to get into the building i noticed that the car wasnt slowing down they ran the stop sign but i was able to get out of the way before they hit me im on the sidewalk now and the woman in the car stopped and rolled down her window she yells out hey i was just trying to get your attention where is the nearest overpriced coffee chain i was told there is one in your plaza there are two of those not even a minutes drive down the street and another three on campus there is no sign for that shop in my little plazas marquee but really i shouldnt expect that woman who thinks attempted vehicular manslaughter is an appropriate attentiongrabber to consult a gps or a map 
i work in photo labdigital printing service it means we print photographs photo books flyers posters cards etc a man came in today and wanted to print thank youcards so first he needed to select if he wants them printed on photo paper or traditional postcardlike paper i placed different papers in front of him so he could compare them that was obviously too hard for him i just want these printed waves an usb stick yes sir i understand but you need to select the material first how is it so fucking hard to just print these no wonder all photo stores are going out of business unbelievably horrible service for over ten minutes i tried to fish information out of him like this no maybe a card like this i thought you were a professional you should know how can this be so hard i showed him every single option we had and nothing pleased him nooo nooo not like that just print it then his ranting became louder and louder disturbing other customers so finally i gave up and told him either to leave or make up his mind and tell me what is it you want because honestly i dont know he stared at me and said youre a really shitty salesperson and left im so sorry that my employer doesnt provide us with mindreading crystal balls they would come in handy

about a week or so ago my fellow coworker dropped this story on me im sharing this on his behalf he works the same place i work a gas station kiosk we both work separate because its a one person kiosk this is what happened for context this customer was really dumb employee yes sir customer i would like xxx in gas and i also want a fuel injector cleaner for my vehicle employee sorry sir we dont sell any injector cleaners other than what is sold through the pump we dont sell any fuel system cleaners because when you pay for gas the pump prompts you if you want to buy any its a contract that we have to sell that stuff so we dont sell other competitors cleaners in our oil cart many customers understand this and many more do not and hate it because they want a certain brand or whatever customer well why not i want x brand cleaner employee we only sell x brand at the pump he pays for his gas and turns around looks at our oil cart proceeds to grab a bottle of our power steering fluid and walks to the pump which his happens to be right in front of the kiosk my coworker didnt say anything because he sees him and customer just come back and pay after they use item we hate it but they come back and pay for it anyway rarely do we have to make customer pay for acting stupid thinking we wont say anything maybe he needed power steering fluid who knows so man goes to his pump and proceeds to pour that power steering fluid into his gas tank at this time my coworker was busy with a technician who was he to repair a broken pump when he finally saw the customer putting the power steering fluid in his tank it was to late he had already started both my coworker and tech are dumbfounded employee wow what a dumbass tech you gonna tell him employee no i told him we didnt sell fuel injector cleaner other than at the pump and he wants to be a idiot let him tech eh not my problem the man finishes pumping gas and comes back to pay for his power steering fluid customer so much for you dont sell fuel injector cleaner employee excuse me we dont i had told you we only see what is at the pump you just poured power steering fluid into your gas tank customer finally looks at bottle well im not paying for it employee the hell your not you used it not in the correct way but you used it its gonna be xxx customer left without saying another word but just amazing i have yet to see him and so has my coworker but this was beyond me customer thought the joke was on my coworker for lying to him but it was on him for not reading the bottle he took and used
i had a rough day today our cash register broke after i fixed it a mistype charged a customer instead of only in the cash register and not the credit card machine so i spent a good thirty minutes voiding that transaction in the register difficulty level expert because after a certain amount of money around youre unable to cancel a transaction and have to charge it through and void it etc etc this is while also helping other customers in the store it was busy i wanted to lock myself in the bathroom and take a nap the store i work at is literally filled to the brim with merch were packed of our clientele are repeat customers i know their names and faces they know my name and treat me like a human being its extremely pleasant but extremely hectic and busy anyway this woman who is a semiregular had come in and ordered probably of monogrammed items for graduation presents and on her way out her purse knocked into a ceramic pitcher it fell over and shattered our policy isnt necessarily you break it you buy it since were a mom and pop store so it really depends on the customer charging a customer for a broken item is completely discretionary on whoevers in charge that day so usually up to me since ive been at the store the longest of the current employees and the owner of the store took today off so this woman knocks a pitcher over it shatters on the floor huge crash hundreds of little bitty pieces oh my god im so sorry she starts to pick up the broken pieces i grab a broom and come over to sweep it up my bag must have bumped into it and knocked it over i feel terrible im so sorry she says maam with the amount of items we have in the store its bound to happen every so often dont worry about it i hope it wasnt expensive how much do i owe yall nothing maam it was obviously an accident and its only around so its not that big of a deal really let me pay for it maam the fact that youre helping me clean it up is so refreshing that there is no way im going to charge you for this are you sure yes really thank you for helping me have a great day im finished sweeping it up and shes out the door i grab a box to put the broken pieces in and throw the whole thing in a dumpster and just as i get back inside the phone rings i answer its the same woman i just really wanted to just say once again how sorry i am that i broke that pitcher i know it was an accident and you said that it was fine but i really am more than happy to pay for it maam im going to be completely blunt with you when things get broken in the store im the one that decides on the you break it you buy it policy not only was this a complete accident but you didnt try to hide that you had broken something you even helped me clean it up you have to understand that never happens after the start of my day today how you responded to breaking something was so unbelievably refreshing and kind theres no way im going to charge you youre the type of customer im happy to do things like this for she thanked me again told me she appreciated it i had a smile on my face for the rest of the day its the little things
i came into work today clocked in and noticed something strange on my time slip instead of kt cook on the bottom i have the label ft sl i walk to the back office where my manager is doing some paperwork and ask him what it meant oh yeah that stands for front end shift lead uh what yeah wait nobody told me oh well congrats youre the new supervisor so i got a promotion and they neglected to tell me
i was a cashier for the worlds largest burger joint in highschoolcollege and i regularly volunteered for drive through duty quite simply because it was interesting and you never know what youll see one night right before close two bros come to my window besides the fact that they kept changing their minds about what they wanted and generally just being dicks both of them were drunk off their asses they finally paid and pulled forward and i was still annoyedfor two seconds when one of my regulars pulled up in his squad car on duty the stars must have been aligned or the universe smiling on me but i was like hey dave i was getting ready to call you guys but that guy in front of you is wasted and you can smell it its bad hes like o rly didnt order waited till they got their food then flipped on the lights as i was closing up i kept looking out as it progressed from sobriety tests to back up to handcuffs to tow truck impounding at least they got those mcchickens edit formatting and yes i took him and his back up a meal as i left probably wasnt warm by then but good enough for the midnight munchies
i showed great restraint by not beating some customers to death the family was in my shop for about minutes before i noticed the dog the mom asked to use the bathroom and handed off what i thought was the ladys brown clutch purse it was a tiny puppy apparently they bought the puppy at the flea market down the street before entering my store it was seven weeks old and severely dehydrated not surprising since it was a scorching hot day somehow they thought that it was a great time to go book shopping as soon as i saw how lethargic the dog was i got a dish of water the puppy gratefully lapped it up and seemed to perk up a bit the family was in no hurry to leave i told them that the dog looked like he needed some food the woman snapped that she knew all about taking care of dogs she also told me the dog was a pure bred puggle so as well as needing dog care books she needed a dictionary she mentioned that she didnt want to give the dog any water since she was worried that it would pee in the car a seven week old puppy it shouldnt even be away from its mother at seven weeks then they mentioned that they live about an hours drive away actually i dont know if i showed great restraint in not beating them or abdicated my responsibility as a human being a big part of me wanted to take that dog away from them i really hope the puppy is okay
hey there tfr ive posted before like that time a lady tried to convert me but i dont strictly work retail however theres a retail component to my job in fact we broke our all time sales record tonight closing at which is almost triple what we pull in on a normal night so bit of back story we run a shop which is open from am to pm however we have a stargazing program that goes from pm to pm then we bring in the telescopes and go home were open every day of the year every night a car rolls in at pm we call them the inevitable nine fifty fivers so the ers get out asks how he can use the telescopes i tell him that you dont we do but have a look through because thats why theyre around then one of them tries to go inside our doors were open to bring some stuff inside from outside i tell him were closed he insists that because google told him were open until we should let him in gt me no sir i cant do that were closed gt him but i just want a map gt me yes we have maps for sale but were closed gt him oh theyre for sale gt me yes they are and were closed you may look through a telescope if youd like theyre out here for a few more minutes gt him so i cant just come inside there are only a few times when ive wanted to tell someone to fuck off while im at work so i did it in a nice way kind of gt me no sir absolutely not it is strictly prohibited and not least of all we are closed the money is away and counted weve closed up everything and taken inside the carts with the water and such theres nothing left and your girlfriend is running to the car because its freezing cold out we are not open until you are mistaken and no you cant continue to drive to the summit its probably best you just head home as theres nothing left to do here and so they did they left and all was good again
of my two fulltime jobs one is as the manager of a pet supply retail store i was on a register when a woman came through my line to check out me alright your total is she took out her purse and calmly handed me two twenty dollar bills i waited but she made no motion to find any change i waited but she just stared at me me its and two cents maam i repeated myself in case she hadnt heard me she eyed me in this weirdly angry and suspicious way and then smugly declared i dont carry change like it was beneath her and she just let it linger awkwardly between us while she stared at me defiantly me well the total is and two pennies and i quietly stared back letting her awkward silence linger after a beat or two her face crumpled up and she did this weird exaggerated doubletake of disgust at me as if i had just flipped her off while wearing dead babies for slippers im not kidding it was the most overthetop doubletake ive ever seen outside of bad improv her so what are you going to about that me youve already had in savings with your membership rewards card there arent any more discounts and you dont have any coupons i can put some items back for you if you dont have enough for the rest note i always keep my voice low when people appear to be having problems paying no need to embarrass a customer whos fallen onto hard times ive been there before cue another round of exaggerated doubletakes and nasty looks seriously what the hell is up with these grotesque facial distortions shes doing her i cant believe youre beating me up over two pennies ill take my business elsewhere give me my twenties back i swung my display around to show her the price while handing her back her cash im sorry but thats the total amount due if you want all these items today do you have a credit card maybe its really no problem to put just one of these dog treats back if you dont have change she had seven of the same lowestquality rawhides bags in her bag her dog didnt need one of them much less seven packs of seven her i dont carry change whats so hard to understand about that me then this transaction is over i grabbed her bagged items and put them under the counter out of her reach in case she decided to bolt with them more doubletakes no actually i got a tripletake out of that one and the look of utter disgust i got from her you would have thought i had just defecated into my hand and then heiled hitler at this point i began to suspect i was dealing with a mentally unbalanced person rather than an entitled nochangehaver one of my coworkers an army vet overheard the commotion and quietly came up behind my counter ready to assist if it became physical being a former military police officer in the navy myself i felt confident that i could handle an unkempt white lady in her lateforties but it was nice to see cover taking up position her oh you want a dollar from me is that it the lady was waving her fingers at the cash register screen which was still pointed in her direction me no just two pennies but if you have a dollar more i can give you change back she dug through her purse some and produced a dollar bill which she threw angrily at me but it sort of fluttered comically down to the conveyor belt between us then she wadded up her twenties and slammed them on the belt too i collected her free market offerings and began making change when the lady turned to my coworker behind her and started talking shit about me in hushed tones from what little i could hear it was the usual threats how its the worst service ever how shell never come back here etc and by the way why is it people think ill never come back here again is a threat to retail employees if youre giving us problems we dont want you to come back go sell crazy somewhere else i handed her change back to her and she made this overdramatic act of leaning in and reading the name badges of both myself and my coworker who had done nothing at all throughout the entire exchange as if she was going to complain about the two of us finally she took her items and left once she was out of earshot my coworker told me in the middle of all that she said she was deaf and couldnt read your lips thinking back i know this was a lie because she was answering my greetings without even looking at me at the start of the transaction while she was loading up her items on the conveyor belt at no point in the interaction did she act like she couldnt understand what i was saying me no no no that was not the issue here she understood everything i was saying she just didnt like what i was saying you can be deaf and a jerk at the same time the moral of this story is that you get more flies with honey than you do with vinegar edit most of you in the comments are right if the lady was nice or had asked if it was okay that she was two measly pennies short i would have bent over backwards to help her out i probably could have found a off coupon somewhere in our office that would have saved her even more than two cents but she was rude and forfeit reciprocal courtesies as a consequence of her own actions edit ive been repeatedly called a jerk for this story which is fine i am one in real life but in this story i went through our lines for customer engagement and resolution nearly verbatim customer doesnt give you the full amount due ask for the full amount again customer doesnt have enough money offer to put an item back ask for alternative method of payment hold items for later pickup or void transaction cashiers are under no circumstances allowed to volunteer to undermine our own sales prices ie the customer has to ask specifically for a reduction and even if they do ask price adjustments are done at the managers discretion as circumstances warrant which they probably arent going to do if the only reason you want it is because youre an unpleasant person i find it a little comical that i was harassed and threatened by a lying customer and after following my own stores pointofsale policy people have been calling me the jerk if i was wearing a short skirt and sporting some cleavage would i have deserved it too
about a year ago i started working at a large retail chain the particular location i was employed at was going through a lot of changes in management procedures and the like basically the store was in a shambles logistically and couldnt keep employees for more than a month or two at best beyond the usual age verification for certain items there was no standard procedure followed by anybody with regards to people purchasing tobacco lottery or basically any highvalue items that had to be stored behind the counter we would take the items scan them and put them on the counter while the customer paid for them didnt have any issues one day we had a loss prevention guy come in and observe our security procedures one of his suggestions was that when making these kind of sales we do not place them in reach of the customers until they are paid for in full okay seems reasonable nobody should have a problem with this unless they actually plan to steal shit right not so from the time we implemented the measure there was one guy a regular who came in to buy cigarettes every day and he had a huge problem with this where are my cigarettes theyre here behind the counter sir well why arent they in my hand yet because you have not yet paid for them sir we have new security measures in place to prevent potential losses so you think im going to steal them no sir well then put them in my fucking hand no sir that would breach proper procedure i dont think youre going to steal them but this is the rule and it will be followed i dont care what the rule is you have no right to treat me like a criminal now put the smokes in my hand or im going to talk to your manager okay sir ill call him from the back so i rang the button that dingdonged the backroom and an assistant manager came out and asked what was going on they talked for a while and decided that i would place the cigarettes in his hand breaching procedure and making me look like an asshole so i did and the guy smirks at me and says there was that so hard at least your managers are competent maybe you should get a job cleaning toilets or something seems more your speed right in front of my manager at this point i looked at my manager and said hey mike did you hear what he just said to me that was an abusive comment and im not going to take it i told him to hand back the cigarettes and get out of the store but he refused you put them in my hand theyre mine now take my money or dont theyre mine so i looked at my manager and said this is what happens when you dont follow procedure and make me look like an idiot mike this is your problem now i quit and i walked out abusive customers suck and managers who abide them are worse edit guys dont downvote people just for respectfully suggesting that i could have done things differently if somebodys being an asshole and lobbing insults fine but theres a comment from mrjigglybrown buried down there that i dont feel warrants the negative attention its receiving he seems like an ok guy 
hey everyone bleubleh long time lurker blabla mobile phone and formatting and english language etc so the background story goes like this i have a jewellery store with my partner we are located in a small mall with a mix of very very wealthy customers and not so wealthy customers ive only had one real incident before in the ca on and off years in retail but in the past year ive had an office job which has made me a bit slow in terms of knowing if the customer is actually for real with their craziness the incident happened today with a local customer who is not a customer since he didnt come to buy anything he just came to trash talk me just a quick note the culture in this country is such that most of the local men canare very degrading towards young women especially us young foreign girls i am mixed raced half of that country and half white anyways the man will be called dh for dickhead and my partner will be p dh comes to the shop to look at our k gold chains dh where are the free samples p huh we dont give out free samples this is a product to buy dh dont you guys want to make money or what p uh yes but how can we make money if we give out free samples me this is just a shop we are not like those outside promoting their products there were people outside by the supermarket promoting beer and diapers dh sorry what did you say just a shop just a shop are you telling me youre not a business but just a shop do you even know what that means me yes the point of my statement is that we are an actual store we are not temporarily sitting here with any bogof deals or whatever promotions dh well thank you for admitting you mistake with the first sentence i think that you should tell your boss when you see him that he should send you to school so you can learn about business and all that me confused if he is joking uhm i am the boss and i do have a degree in business what are we talking about right now dh oh ok well it is always good to have one fool for a boss and one clever person for a boss and your partner seems to be a clever person me are you calling me a fool dh yes i am a boss myself and i know how it is in a business with using a local word for fools do you know what that word means do you even know the language here next time i come i will bring my business book for you me yes i know and no i dont need that thanks he was so casual about everything so i was really shocked about how he said it it doesnt help that i am a very patient and polite person who will try and avoid confrontations as much as possible but i obviously got pissed at my partner for not standing up for me as he just sat there in silence with his mouth wide open i really really really wish i could swear at him i will not sleep tonight next time
to start off these are going to be a short series of stories that ive stored from my time working at an law enforcement officer leo retail store despite the title its by no means meant to be political argument for or against guns its just well youll see and sorry for the length i did a post about this store called you think you had a bad anyways onto the stories first experiences before starting working where i work now i only had limited experience with guns firearms weapons etc i was nervous as all get out to work behind the gun counter one of the people training me laid some ground rules about handling firearms that should always be followed these rules are the weapon is always loaded even when you know the weapon is unloaded its always loaded always point the weapon at a safe direction never at someone see rules and for why when handing a weapon over to someone make sure the slidebolt is locked back and present the arms to them with the chamber so they can see that its cleared when a weapon is handed to you always clear it see rules and never point a firearm at something that you dont intend to kill there is no such thing as shooting to injure finger is never on the trigger unless you are ready to kill whatever it is you are pointing at i also developed a habit of not walking in front of pointed weapon people will take a weapon and look down the sights usually aiming at the back counter wall i would wait to the side for them to raise or lower the weapon due to rules and notice a theme most people will drop sight line raise the weapons barrel to point at the ceiling lower the weapon down etc to let me pass cool no problem my first day behind the gun counter and the first customer i had behind there wanted to see a glock i remove the weapon from the case clear it locked the slide back handed it to him and the proceeded to let the slide forward and take aim to see how it fit in his hands problem he was pointing it right at me i moved to the side to get out of the line of fire and he followed me sir could you please not point the weapon at me why its not loaded i dont care please dont point the weapon at me stop being such a at this point a coworker whos been there for years reaches out grabs the slide from the top breaks the guys grip and tells him to leave why do i have to leave because you arent being safe with the weapon you need to leave now fuck you i want to see a manager fine my coworker calls out a name down at the other end of the counter is the president of the company the name called was his my coworker tells the president what just happened including the fuck you part the president looks at me asks if i did have a gun pointed at me yes sir asked the customer if he did point the gun at me yeah but it was unloaded the president looks at the guy and says matter of factlyget the fuck out of my store and dont come back the guy started to cause a slight ruckus about it saying that he shouldnt be talking to a customer that way which was meet with a reply of you stopped being a customer when you pointed a gun at one of my employees the guy wasnt moving and was getting more and more angry since we are cater to leo and military we usually have a sheriff police officer constable state police federal agent in store the president pointed out that right now the guy is trespassing and disturbing the public and that theres five officers looking at him ready to take him out of the store and to downtownjail if he doesnt leave now officers were watching the scene unfold and were just waiting i never seen so many different people from different agencies waiting to bust some jerks ass fine im never coming here again the customer said i know and i dont care the big boss said yes we accept trades after a while you get to feel for how heavy a weapon is unloaded and can tell when it is loaded even if you never held a loaded weapon before theres a certain weight to it and the balance is different so we take trades this guy comes in looking to trade his shotgun for credit to get a different shotgun no biggie we do this all the time we tell him to bring in the weapon and make sure its cleared he brings in the shotgun and hands it to me it felt different heavier are you sure this is cleared yeah i cleared it before i put it in the car so most of you know its not very smart to carry a loaded shotgun in a cartruck or have one in the chamber because it can accidentally discharge shotguns dont usually have a drop safety and some hard bumps can make the hammer strike the shell causing an accidental discharge its illegal at least in my state to have a loaded shotgun in the vehicle for these reasons i rack the action and a shell goes flying out and hits the guy in the forehead i follow the shell in flight in slow motion as i see it hit him in the head thinking what the fuck man i rack it six more times six more shells go flying out he is told to put the shells back in his car and well finish the trade when he comes back in he also got a stern talking too by one of the mangers i need a holster we sell anything an officer needs duty gear pants holsters accessories for their weapons badges vehicle equipment you name it we have it or can get it so a local officer comes in and needs a holster we can help you with a holster what weapon do you have i dont know this happens more times than i feel comfortable with saying if my sample size is any indication about other officers a good dont know what side arm they carry we ask if he has it with him he says yes and we tell him to clear the weapon lock the slide back and bring it in and we can help him find a holster he comes back in with a weapon cleared we see that its a common weapon and we have different holsters for it and show him the holsters as he is looking at the holster someone notices that he has a full loaded magazine in the the weapon he drops the slide which chambers a round the gun is now hot live and ready to shoot someone mentions this to him as he slides the weapon into the wrong holster the weapon is stuck fuck us a loaded gun is stuck in a holster coworker gets that look of slight panic i grab the weapon and holster from the customer drop the magazine and keep the whole thing pointed down at the floor i explained to the guy that we can try to take the weapon out but its gotta come off the floor and we have to take it our vault and for his safety and the safety of others hes not allowed in there i also tell him very politely how much of a dumb ass he is hes cool with this and does feel very stupid im cant really fault him too much because we failed at our job too make sure that it really is safe so i take it to the vault and try to figure out how to get this things out safely i call in two other more experience coworkers to help figure this out after some cussing grumbling lots of wd and talk about taking a saw to the holster we finally got it free the next day everyone got a lecture and retaining on weapon safety im on the swat team people come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes sheriffs at least in my part of the woods tend to be on the bigger size of things this big fellow comes in and is looking for tactical gear for his swat riguniform he has a purchase order from his department he needs everything new body armor clothing thigh rig chest holster sling for the ar he has to get new duty belt rig the whole nine the problem we didnt have anything that fit him we can measure for body armor as those are custom made but the sheet measurements didnt go that big pants we didnt have anything close to his size i had to take a measuring tape or two to get the guys waist size we had to order a xl for frame of reference im a size waist when these pants finally came in myself and another guy got into each leg of the pants and had room for more people of course he was offended that everything had to be custom made that we didnt have it in stock and would be up charged for the size which the department po didnt take into account the horrible person in me was thinking that they were going to use him for tactical entry as a human shield i also joked with some other coworkers that the department should order all his gear in red and when he does bust down the door have him scream oh yeah alright i think this is long enough i have other stories that ill share at a later time enjoy edit minor typos

this happened to me several years ago when i was training as loss prevention at the big store with a smiley face as a mascot i had traveled to another store to be trained by that stores loss prevention associate emily we were walking the floor and it was my first day or two of training so we were watching a lot of people and also going over a lot of the dos and dont being a very corporate company the rules were designed to protect the store from lawsuits more then stop shoplifters and were long complicated and strict one of these rules was the minimum age of a child that we were allowed to stop if we noticed shoplifting i believe it was but i am not as it has been many years this kid who looks to be years old and has a look like he has gotten whatever he wants during his life walks by us and emily instantly suspects him of being up to no good so we follow him he belines it without his parents to the toy aisle we see him with the grace expected of most kids his age take a rubix cube off the shelf remove it from the packaging put the rubix cube in his pocket and throw the packaging unceremoniously under a shelf i am ecstatic because at first i think we are going to have an easy catch emily informs me of the minimum age we can stop someone and that he looks too young to stop this deflates me a little then annoys me as i cant stop this little shit from stealing from us i pick the package up to take it out of our system later we watch the kid for a little while longer as he goes back to his parents and then leaves his parents after a minute or two he is alone again in another aisle acting like he owns the place and checking out anything he likes at this point i reaffirm we cant stop the kid or do anything about the rubix cube emily reaffirms this and i decide to try and scare the kid i wait at the far end of the next aisle under he comes down it he turns the corner a minute later and i step out at the other end of the aisle and stop in one hand is the torn packaging from the rubix cube and my other hand i have my fingers tapping the packaging one finger at a time i give the kid my best i got you fucker smug look while slowly shaking my head back and forth he instantly freezes up and goes from smiling to bright red his eyes start to water up a little and he knows he did not get away with it i stand there just tapping the packaging for a couple seconds shaking my head until he backs out of the aisle and goes to find his parents emily is dumbstruck at what i have just done i ask her if what i did was wrong and she tells me that it was awesome we watch the kid reunite with his parents the kid tries to keep a tough appearance up but spots me a little while later walk by and i just shake my head with a big disappointing look from afar this put the kid over the top and after a minute or two his dad clearly sees something is wrong with him as the kid starts to break down the tear works are in full swing but the kid wont say a thing to his parents and after a couple more minutes they all walk out the store i dont know if the kid ever dropped the rubix cube or not or if he came clean with his parents all i know is he was distraught as they left the store and the parents werent getting anything out of him then i probably shouldnt have felt as good about what i had done as i did but that kid needed to taught a lesson

so weve all had the parents come into our workplace and let their kids run wilddestroy the storetreat employees like crap i once had a parent dump a kids piggy bank on the counter and sit and laugh while i counted out all the change but today i had a good experience with a parent and wanted to share the little kid was about years old and had clearly been saving for this toy for awhile he had his money all wadded up in his hand like crumbled and stuff his mom caught it as he was handing it to me and she crouched down to his level mom now look at what youre about to give her what would you think if someone gave that to you would that be very nice the little boy looked at his hand and kind of shrugged mom lets unfold this and count it out when you buy something you always hand the nice lady or man your money the way youd want your money handed to you so that means you count it out and you unfold it and you put it in their hand and not on the counter you wouldnt like it if someone just dropped it in front of you so thats how we treat other people i basically wanted to hug this mom it took her kid an extra minute or so to unwad his bills but the gesture was so nice i love when parents teach their kids some respect and courtesy its so rare sometimes and it just really warms my heart when they do
i work at a small bakery we make fresh doughnuts every day and also serve coffee milk etc most customers get the exact same thing every day and we know most orders by face we work in a small community theres this one lady i cant stand and one day she pushed me over the edge im a manager now but when i was working the front counter one busy friday morning she showed up i could see her desperately trying to look at the doughnut and pastry case along with what we had brewing for coffee i was waiting on someone when she says from behind them you need to hurry up because im going to be late for work well you know what lady maybe if you had planned your morning better you wouldnt be in this predicament in the first place seesh i took my sweet time making that coffee edit thanks for my very first gold 
so this happened awhile ago i work at the end of the mall right next to a childrens playground so we get a lot of mothers with their hyper kids so a mother comes in with three kids the mom is very intent on browsing and grabbing lots of items the little girl is whining and doing a pee dance but the mom keeps shushing her we get them into a dressing room when she leaves the dressing room one of the associates goes to clean it out and to our horror there is pee all over the floor we clean it up one of the associates tells the mother about it the mother proceeds to yell at the child like she didnt know like you somehow dont know your child is in a urine soaked white dress and you were standing in it while you changed clothes she then continues to shop as if nothing happened while the wet child following her around she buys items briefly apologizes and leaves while telling the girl shes going to take her and her siblings to the playground she then comes back two more times within the hour saying her kids are at the playground so she has some more time to look around she bought more things each time i dont even know what to say i just nervously laughed edit cant spell tried to make the story clearer didnt have coffee when typing this 
i work overnights at a gas stationconvenience store on the edge of the ghetto so my customers are a mix of affluent middle of the road people and hood rat types being that i do the overnight shift i see a lot of strange folk pass through my doors last night i had one of the best customer interactions ive had in a long time and surprisingly it was with a hood rat type dude he came up to my register and started piling all of his selections in front of me but instead of the typical chips soda and candy bars he had mixed fruit cups strawberries and dipping cream fresh fruit like apples and bananas and a box of apple i commented on his choices and he replied my nia said bring him somethin fruity so thats what im doin somethin fruity i picked up the cereal and said man i havent had this stuff in years now when i leave tonight im going to have to go buy a box to tear up thanks a lot dude he laughed and went on his way a few minutes later i hear the buzzer from the gas pumps that indicates a customer needs assistance i pressed the button to ask what the matter was and a voice just says dont forget them apple jacks lol edit here you go guys tearin it up 
justiceporn didnt like my submission because i dont have any proof to show this happened but its related to working in retail so i hope you all like it years ago i was attending a local college learning computer repair and networking a guy in my class who was known for being a braggart worked parttime at a big box store that serviced and sold computers he came in one day bragging about his new processor and how much faster his computer ran now he was just dying to tell us how hed outsmarted a different big box store and come out of it with a free processor he told us how hed gone into the store and bought a brand new processor he took it home installed it in his computer and put his old one back in the box he then returned it to the store and got his money back claiming it was defective of course this is clearly theft and it made all of us uncomfortable to hear about and the instructor shook his head sadly at him the next day he didnt show up for class neither did he show up the second day on the third day he came back and was raging mad that things were unfair he told us hed taken the two days off to cool down because he was so angry at what had happened to him it turns out that in addition to bragging to us hed also bragged to all his coworkers at the big box store he thought theyd love his story because hed done the stealing from a competitor his boss was disgusted by his actions and phoned up the store hed ripped off and told them what hed done he told them that the thief would be coming in and returning the real processor and gave them the guys full name and phone number in case he skipped out on it the braggart was afraid of losing his job at this point so he manned up and took back what hed stolen as soon as his boss had confirmation that things had been put right he fired the guy i really like to think that the guy learned something from the whole ordeal but the way he was raging about how unfairly hed been treated i doubt it tldr bosses dont like to hear they have a stupid thief working for them

this summer i worked at a small shoe boutique there were only two employees myself the assistant manager and the owner usually only one of us would be manning the store at a time i had a lot of eccentric customers but for the most part everyone was understanding and respectful except one woman as soon as she walked in i knew that she was going to be difficult she marched through the entrance with her friend in tow and slammed a shopping bag onto my desk try to dispel an argument i ask how may i help you she says my daughter bought these shoes from you and now theyre ruined i am very confused at this point but ask to see whats in the bag she pulls out a shoe box that i recognize as a style we always carry and opens it to reveal the shoes and a receipt the shoes are in fact ruined the soles are completely scratched and there are lots of dirt marks and scrapes on the upper part i look at the receipt and these shoes were purchased two years ago confused i say what seems to be the problem while these shoes are no longer wearable it is obvious that it is due to normal wear and tear after regular use for two years she scoffs and turns to her friend giving her a look that obviously means that she thinks i am incompetent she says i told you already my daughter bought these shoes and now they are ruined i want a full reimbursement or replacement i calmly explain that that isnt possible as we dont accept worn products but that i could check to see if her daughters size was in stock so she could purchase a replacement she and her friend both start yelling at me saying that obviously these shoes should be replaced for free since they fell apart at this point im starting to get really annoyed so i say im sorry but it isnt procedure at any shoe store ive ever been to to replace merchandise that has been worn multiple times i cant accept this return but like i said i would be happy to check to see if her size is here at this she and her friend grumble to each other for a bit while i just stand there awkwardly finally she turns to me and says you obviously are new here and dont know what youre doing pass the message along to your boss and tell her to call me she leaves the store leaving the shoes on the desk luckily my boss came in an hour later to relieve me of my shift i explain the situation to her and she was just as confused as i was she calls the women and asks her what the problem is after the woman explains it to her my boss simply says well im glad she enjoyed the shoes they look well worn we still have her size in stock if shed like to purchase another pair but i cant accept the return after this the women hung up we thought that was the end of it until we got a call a week later from the same women saying that she had to drive hours to the next city to find the right shoes after her experience with our terrible customer service and blaming us for having to pay for the gas money and the cost of the new shoes i simply said im sorry for your trouble but looking back i wish i could have said something i wouldnt want to be the manager at that store when she returns in years demanding a refund 
i work at a pet store that closes at pm on sundays last weekend i was put on the door at to make sure that someone was able to open the door for those leaving that no one else was able to sneak in sometimes my coworkers feel sorry for a shopper i never back down as i was on door duty i saw a lady outside walking her dog in the grass next to the parking i just assumed she had picked her pup up from grooming and was letting it potty before getting into her car i was wrong as i let another person out i notice she was approaching the door me sorry we close at her you serious i been walking my dog out here for min and now you say i cant come inside me im sorry we close at her this is fucking ridiculous she started saying more but alas i shut the door in her face and turned my back to her the joys of closing
a few years ago i worked at a big popular cosmetics store as a skincare consultant a company certified skincare expert actually sometimes rude customers would assume i was a complete moron just spouting off random madeup info to sell stuff because retail workers are obviously incapable of actually having accurate product knowledge or an intelligence level above a cockroach anyway one day a middleaged woman asked for help finding an antiaging serum for her sensitive dehydrated skin i recommended one that had alpha lipoic acid a powerful antioxidant among other things and hyaluronic acid a substance that is naturally present throughout the human body and is able to bind x its weight in water it lubricates joints gives your eyeballs their squishyness and is a major component of your skin as it retains hydration and elasticity etc excellent stuff well i got about as far as this would be a fantastic product for you as it contains both alpha lipoic and hyaluronic acids before she cut me off with excuse me im not going to put anything with acid on my face do you think im stupid i really had to hold my tongue at that question i politely explained that the word acid merely refers to the ph balance of the ingredient and that since human skin is healthiest when its ph level is maintained at its naturally acidic level that acids are not only perfectly safe to use on your skin but preferable to alkalines in most cases i then went on to say that while obviously not all acids are safe for human skin such as hydrofluoric or hydrochloric acid that those particular acids are not going to be found in skincare products really we have nothing to gain from doing that its a terrible terrible idea she was still not convinced and went off on me about how we must think that people are really really stupid if were cramming all our products full of acid shes seen enough news stories about acid attacks and peoples skin melting off to know better then she had the nerve to scoff at my skincare expert badge on my nametag and ask what kind of bogus program the company was running if the experts didnt know that acid was bad for you i replied maam this company actually has an excellent training program however i learned the basics about acids in th grade science its a class i would highly recommend that you take then i walked away

sorry wall of text incoming i handmake stone cabochons and jewelry and in the summer i go to local gem and mineral shows or just events that go on and set up a booth to sell my product as well as mineral jesus christ marie specimens one beautiful summer day i was relaxing with a cold glass of tea and a delicious philly cheese steak sandwich when crotchety old hag coh comes up and starts to browse my pendants she was there for hours literally picking up every single pendant over of them some more than once finally she picks one up and brings it to me and asks can you take for this now the rough stone can cost me anywhere from to a lb we cut and shape using diamond edged saws and grind wheels add in that they are wrapped in k gold fill or sterling silver and i still mark my product below retail because the local economy couldnt handle anything higher so i explain all this to her i walk her through the step by step process to make a pendant explaining gently and politely that i cant mark a pendant down to but i would happily sell it for she proceeds to go on a tirade yelling and cursing about how us young folk were trying to rob the older generation and how i should be ashamed to overcharge so much she then starts to yell at other customers in my booth about how they should buy elsewhere at this point i tell coh she needs to leave or i will flag down the officer they always have at these events coh thats not your decision to make kid go get your superior and see what he says me yes maam right away i walk into my trailer have a few more sips of tea and come back out me hello maam i am the owner what seems to be the problem coh then throws my pendant at me and walks off muttering to herself unfortunately for her the officer happened to be nearby to catch part of the spew of crazy and told her she needs to leave she then begins another rant as she is less than gently escorted out of the park tldr old biddy cant navigate the great material continuum very well
a while back when i was sixteen i had taken a job at a local grocery store i lived in a small town and even through the store was quite small it was the largest one in the county it was the end of my shift and i was waiting for the next employee to get out of the break room to take my place on the stool behind the register the owner refused to allow any employee to work with the register or with anything in the store for that matter after their shift ended so i was sitting on the stool struggling to keep myself upright tired beyond belief while an impatient customer clicked his heel on the tile across from me im sorry sir i said where is leon hes been in the break room for ten minutes i promise this is just as uncomfortable for me as it is for you damm i was tired twelve hours of checking out customers and i felt like a discombobulated kraken stuck in a net why cant you just scan my items he asked i would if i could i forced my eyes to stay open if i still had the strength to yell id give leon a browbeating to befit an insubordinate terrorist in guantanamo bay but if the owner found out i worked after my shift ended hed be as angry as you are right now the customers reply was cut off by the jangle of bells and the slamming of a door mind buzzing with exhaustion i look up yawning into my hand what can i do for you sir features hidden by a stretched panty hose he looked quite comical from a pocket of rough leather he removed a battered pistol that could have been dropped in a blender give me all of it oh shit i scratched my head where was leon why was the man holding a gun sir can you be more specific to what you want all the money he scratched a scabbed forearm and pushed the other customer out of the way in the cash register all the money oh i was being robbed all of it im sorry sir not even the gun perturbed my fatigue i cant work the cash register after my shift is over really he faltered back an inch yea sorry for the inconvenience i said fucking hell the robber screamed and sprinted out of the store i wavered atop the stool for a moment eyelids declining the knowledge of what had happened struck me all at once a speeding truck striking my mind eyes snapping open i shreiked as loud as i could leon

at my last to the owners of my shop also owned a preowned sporting goods resale shop next door the guys over there would hop next door and chat with us while it was slow we were all on friendly terms i went away for vacation and when i came back boy was there gossip greg one of the friendliest and most helpful employees had been fired funny thing was greg had also been on vacation out of state for a family reunion he came back into our shop a couple months later and i got the whole story you see the store manager next door was boss son like many beneficiaries of nepotism he practically got away with murder showing up late or not showing up for shifts opening shop late disappearing for half the day borrowing things for his rec softball team all that good stuff bs also had a habit of calling his employees to cover shifts at the last minute an hour or less of lead time greg as i mentioned had his vacation approved in advance all the paperwork in order tickets purchased bags packed everything was gravy the day hes set to fly out he gets a text from bs telling him he needs to get to the shop asap to cover bss shift not that bs was sick or had some important business function to perform he just had a date no can do obviously greg isnt going to reschedule a flight at the last minute just to cover bss ass so greg texts back and tells him that since the vacation was approved by bs himself as of two months ago he wont be coming in bs being the mature and responsible manager he is sucks it up and covers the shift himself hahaha just kidding no he fires greg via text instead greg he takes it in stride goes on vacation gets back and instead of heading to work heads right to the unemployment office to file a claim for wrongful dismissal paperwork and copies of texts in hand then he goes to a friend who worked for the city and gets a much more lucrative and rewarding job same day nice thing was when all was said and done he won his suit for wrongful dismissal and still got awarded monthly unemployment payments despite already having another job apparently in this state the unemployment office does a routine conference call with employees and employers when verifying claims just to get both sides of the story at once bs was blatant and unashamed of his actions proudly admitting his role in the matter of course its not like bs was punished in any way as far as i know he still manages that place badly

warning nsfw language hey all this is a story from many years ago back when i used to work at a electronics computer appliance media retailer sorry its so long i get verbose sometimes the backstory apparently a man and wife came in and wanted to purchase a refrigerator they found a couple they liked for something around they picked one and paid for it on their credit card they set it up to be delivered some time a few days later no real issues at this point the next day the woman came back in they decided they had changed their minds and didnt want that specific refrigerator anymore and wanted to think about switching to the other one they liked instead no problem delivery was canceled this is where the core problem occurred she neglected to bring the credit card presumably her husbands they had originally paid with back in at this time i dont know if its different now i havent worked there in over a decade we could only process a credit card return if we had the original card to put the money back on she didnt have it and they lived an hour away a manager was called over this manager told the woman in front of two different customer service reps that because she didnt have the credit card we could only process the return for store credit unless of course she made the two hour round trip to grab the credit card the woman was not happy about this but agreed since they were planning on buying a refrigerator with that money anyway as the manager was processing the return he very specifically said something along the lines of just so you know after the close of business today we will no longer be able to undo this transaction you will be stuck with the store credit and theres absolutely no way for us to get this money back onto your credit card give it back to you in cash etc if you want the money back on the credit card you need to show back up here to the store with the credit card before the end of the day and then we have a way well be able to put the money back on the card after the close of business though theres literally nothing we can do to get the money back on the card the woman acknowledged this accepted the store credit voucher and went on her way now heres where i come in the next day im working loss prevention for the store standing at the front checking receipts monitoring cameras etc nothing out of the usual was happening when all of a sudden i hear a loud commotion coming from the customer service desk a woman is yelling at one of the customer service representatives something along the lines of you guys are thieves give me back my money it was the woman from the day before at this point i have no idea what the situation is though i ask someone to cover the desk for me and head over to see what is going on the manager who had helped her out the day before happened to be there he arrived at customer service desk at the same time i did apparently when her husband got home from work that night after we had already closed he informed her that he had already purchased another refrigerator from one of our competitors assuming she would be able to handle the return of the one they had purchased from us she informed him of the store credit situation and he got pissed she was sent back to try to do the return she was already informed would be impossible the manager did what he could to calm the woman down she was screaming and crying and talking about how we robbed them of her money etc the manager reminded the woman of the conversation they had the day before of course she accused the manager of lying and said he never told her anything like that however he had witnesses and in addition that exact policy was spelled out in plain english on both her receipt and the wall right next to her it was literally impossible for him to process the return now that the close of business had come and gone at this point she had store credit and you cant return store credit he apologized but said there was nothing he could do and asked her to step aside if she didnt have any other business she stepped aside but then just started swearing at every customer as they approached the customer service desk dont fucking buy anything from these assholes they will steal your fucking money at the point i had to ask her to leave as she was causing a disturbance she complied but on her way out yelled i am calling my husband wait until he gets here you fuckers will all pay fast forward a few hours and in storms the most irate looking man ive ever seen in my life face beet red fists clenched looking like hes ready to punch the first person who says a word to him hes not a big dude or anything but he looks pissed he storms up to me and to his credit quite calmly says please point me towards customer service i point he heads off that way i know theres going to be trouble at this point so i call back to the warehouse and ask for the biggest guys back there to come up to the front i lucked out we had a guy back there who was about probably lbs and another who was about at this point i was about and maybe together we were a formidable enough force that i figured wed be able to handle whatever happened i got someone to cover the desk and headed over to customer service by the time i get there the dude is already screaming his ass off at some poor year old customer service rep who is desperately trying to get anyones attention to come help her the manager gets there just as i do again and tries to calm the man down the man isnt hearing a word of it though he throws the credit card and store credit voucher in the customer service reps face and says if that money doesnt get back on that card in the next two minutes something bad is going to happen well he was right i approach the man from behind and i see the two guys from the warehouse jogging up the manager says sir your wife was informed of our return policies when she processed the return theres literally nothing anyone here in the store can do for you the man replies bullshit you guys can do it and you will do it my manager sir i assure you we literally cant the system wont allow it theres nothing we can do you need to leave the man says no fuck that im not leaving until i get my money i dont care how pull cash out of the drawer i dont care give me my fucking money my manager says sir we cant help you the corporate number is on your original receipt maybe they can do something we cant do it here you need to calm down and leave the premises now the guy says im not going anywhere fuck you manager says i have now asked you to leave if you dont leave the premises in the next seconds im calling the police and having you arrested for trespassing the guy responds fuck you call them i dont give a fuck so the manager picks up the phone and starts dialing meanwhile the dude starts screaming at the customer service rep again who just looks like a deer in headlights i say firmly sir you have been asked to leave you are trespassing it is really in your best interest to leave now before things get worse this apparently startled him he didnt know i was there he quickly turns and swings at me luckily for me the dude was off balance and threw a terrible punch so i was able to dodge out of the way of it i charge him and slam him into the customer service desk the other two dudes from the warehouse jump in and we wrestle the guy to the ground where the lbs dude just holds him down the guy hilariously squirms and flails beneath the weight of this huge guy swearing up a storm ah fuck you get off me fuck you pieces of shit fucking assholes this lasted for a couple of minutes after realizing hes not nearly strong enough to get out of the situation he starts to calm down and bargain okay okay youre right i should just go just let me up and ill leave calmly my manager having gotten off the phone with the police at this point says we gave you plenty of chances for that you decided not to go at this point you assaulted one of my employees and you are going to go to jail and went to jail he did he was charged with battery for throwing the cards in the customer service reps face assault for verbal threats such as something bad is going to happen and swinging at me and trespassing failing to leave the premises when ordered he plead guilty across the board i never heard what his sentence was and thats the time i was assaulted because of a refrigerator

i work in a strip mall the collection of stores consists of very few name brand places and several momandpop style stores that provide a number of obscure or unexpected services while i work in one of the actual retail chains this one comes from one of our across the hall neighbors a aromatherapycandle store one of the mom and pop businesses business is carrying on as usual for them which is to say actually quite brisk of course the problem customer arrives a middle aged man looking for dinner candles however the request quickly becomes incredibly specific he is looking for red candles that are exactly seven inches pointed and were packaged in a way that displayed dinners with wine on the little cardboard thing now with something that esoteric the cashiers went ahead and checked around however in the back room the owner was taking some stock and gave the cashier in the back room the news they had never sold seven inch candles like that it was all for aromatherapy stuff and in candles the only tall ones they had were scented too the cashier returned with a set of red candles which had been shrink wrapped not factory produced or anything and the customer actually gets insulted they could not be above seven inches nor could they be scented he then insisted that the candle store was the last place he had gotten them a few years back he starts to get irate slapping his hands on the countertops for each syllable and getting louder like doing so will somehow make these candles materialize or make the cashiers realize they are wrong in some way for these things not existing he gets increasingly angrier reducing the small stores registers to instead of as he occupies one and refuses to move unless he gets these very specific seven inch red dinner candles with the picture on the front no no i got them here this was the only place i got them the supervisor gets involved he tries to explain the only thing they have are the ones the cashier brought up the man falls back on his previous argument of no i know i got them here and in general being so flustered its making customers leave the store this carries on for almost two hours two hours every cashier has been involved and the supervisor even we across the way can see this as it unfolds through the glass windows finally another guy comes up from behind all the other customers behind the register with a set of the red candles he asks the cashier for a ruler measures them out and bites the flat ends off he slams them down onto the counter and yells heres your fing candles now since i know you can take more than seven inches back there when the stick is out take em and get out the candlebiter storms out in a huff swearing up a storm the guy turns back to the cashier group and gets really pissed he screams at them as if they have wronged him somehow i want to talk to your owner the supervisor shrugs bewildered and says you just did

for some time i worked in a college bookstore first as the assistant manager then later as the big cheese this is a story from when i was the assistant i came in just as the third keyholder opened the door and in his usual tactful manner he said ducks you look terrible he wasnt wrong i wasnt feeling very well at all however the store manager was in her eighth month of pregnancy and had a neonatal care appointment that morning until she showed up i pretty much had no choice but to be there i pulled up a seat at my desk grabbed a soda out of the beer fridge we had and began to open the mail from the past week invoice invoice credit memo invoice i have no idea what this is invoice so on and so forth after about minutes of this i had this sudden feeling like my heart just tripped and fell down a flight of stairs bouncing off each one on the way as if that wasnt bad enough my pulse rate shot through the roof and i felt really hot i stood up and staggered out of the store heading to the bathroom the whole time my heart going a mile a minute i saw my face and immediately went back to the store slowly and carefully getting back in i asked the tactful opener to call and i sat down on a nearby stool at the end of the counter a few moments later i was handed the handset and i was being asked questions by the operator no im not in pain yes my heart is still beating no im not out of breath and on and on fortunately the campus is about a mile from a hospital it only felt like it took forever for the emts to show up one of the guys started to erect the stretcher unit while the other began to take my blood pressure and check my pulse then came the words i never thought id ever hear in reference to myself i cant get a pulse my heart was going so fast that the emt couldnt count the individual beats oh and the bp was offscale high as well at this point i was having trouble standing up one emt took position on either side of me and we started to get me headed to the stretcher and then i heard it excuse me i need one of those snickers bars yep right there was a coed pointing past me at the candy rack the rack the emts the stretcher and oh by the way i was in front of my opener talked to her for a second as i laid back on the stretcher i assume saying something like itll be just a moment i dont want to interfere with a medical emergency or something along those lines but im late for class the store manager was walking in as they were wheeling me out oxygen mask firmly clamped on my face i explained that i was going to take a sick day and they loaded me in the ambulance once they hooked me up to the gizmos and doohickies and machines that go ping my pulse was bpm and my bloodpressure was something like why blood wasnt squirting out my pores ill never understand as it turns out i have a birth defect that ill describe as an extra nerve in my heart when it fires my heart has a chance of going crazy its not uncommon they told me later and most people wont ever know they have it i was just lucky i guess it hasnt happened since i dont know if our customer got her snickers bar edit woo quote of the day at least the customer was good for something

ive been working at a coffee chain in a food court for about years and ive had my fair share of regular customers come and go our most common regulars are older folks whose best part of their day is coming out to the shopping centre where i work and getting their daily coffee ever since i started this cute old european couple would come in religiously every morning the man was named angelo and i never found out the name of his wife but they knew my name i believe my name tag was a giveaway they would order small cappuccinos in the round cups we changed our cup design about years back but they preferred the old cups so we kept aside for them gradually i made the change from service to barista angelo would greet me enthusiastically every time he came in spergus ahhhh your coffee is the best im not the best with compliments so i would proceed to blush profusely as my coffee skills improved so did my coffee art i would always make sure angelos cappuccinos looked superb i cant help it i attend art school hearts feathers stripes or when i screwed it up an abstract bird angelo would go sit about metres from the counter with his wife and when id finish making my coffees id gesture in his direction theyd both look up excitedly and either angelo or his lovely wife would come on over the wife would always say in her thick european accent your coffees all i want to do is look at them too good to drink haha theyd really appreciate it i really looked forward to seeing them whenever i was working it was the least i could do anyway a few months ago they were coming in less frequently angelo started sporting a hat the hat was stylish however i could tell he was hiding something they were more grateful than ever for our service they would say on more than one occasion how seeing us smile would make them feel happier inside even if there was sadness around it would brighten their days that really meant a lot to me especially as i could get some pretty shit people come in and treat me appallingly id ask angelo how he was sincerely not just as a customer service reflex i was worried he didnt look well he was less cheery than usual a lot less cheery id ask how are you and hed give me this shrug like ehh what can you do about it he was sick we subsequently saw them less and less while i was away overseas for about a month angelos wife came in to the shop she came in to tell us that angelo had passed away she was close to tears but managed to say his funeral was packed not surprised he was a popular guy my manager was working at the time and had to go around to the back because she too was on the verge of tears i guess she didnt want to upset the wife any further i think shes too upset understandably to come back to get coffee the second round cup broke recently too now theres only one edit thank you everyone for sharing similar stories it has been a pleasure to read them albeit the sadness i believe with the older people especially its part of your job to look out for them its always distressing when they disappear out of the blue come to think of it i havent seen norma in a while update the wife came in today she ordered coffees for her and her pals nice to see her happy shes still using angelos coffee card though it has his name on it
for years i was a pharmacist in a very busy store with a super demanding clientele the neighborhood is very wealthy and they tend to be the kind of wealthy that is convinced its constantly being cheated by everyone they expect a lot and they tend to be ungrateful even after theyve gotten it needless to say while stressful the store provided me with lots of amusement in retrospect todays story begins when we have a workman come in to look at our water line the distilled water we use to mix liquid suspensions we have a suspended ceiling in the pharmacy and the water line is above it so the guy got up on a ladder and went into the ceiling i have no idea what he was standing on up there but he lost his footing and fell face first right through the suspended ceiling onto the floor which is just carpet squares over concrete everything in the pharmacy stops as we have a bleeding unconscious man on the floor my fellow pharmacist goes to assess the damage i call hes not dead but he is out cold we are walking distance from the fire station and the paramedics are there before you know it minutes tops while they are putting him on a stretcher i notice the phone ringing and i pick it up i need you to page my doctor at the hospital right now its the middle of the day we generally dont page during the day plus with current events being what they are i am a bit flustered you want me to page him why its an emergency and i was on hold for fifteen minutes this is doubtful but i still apologize im sorry sir but things are crazy here we just had a guy fall through the ceiling the paramedics are here is he an employee i am baffled but answer yes then he doesnt matter im a customer im more important yes honest to god the guy actually said that are you going to page my doctor or what now i am really flabbergasted um sure give me the number where i can reach him he does what am i calling for hell know ill be there in minutes to pick it up and he hangs up by now the workman is on his way to the hospital and my manager is scrubbing up the blood on the carpet which never came completely clean i recount the phone conversation to my coworkers who all decide this guy is the biggest asshole ever then i dutifully page his doctor at the hospital the rx i got was the icing on the cake his emergency was for hemorrhoid suppositories the workman by the way was more or less okay but he did end up with a broken nose and a concussion
i used to work loss prevention for a large retail clothing store that sells very popular jeans so one afternoon im sitting in my office watching our cameras when i see someone slightly suspicious going in and out of the mens dressing room every few minutes i walk over to get a better look at what he is doing as im on my way over the fire alarms go off well crap i get on the radio and start telling employees where to post then go to the fire control panel to see what alarm is going off a smoke detector had triggered but it did not say where everyone else has been cleared the building by this time except two people two people that refuse to exit a stall in the mens fitting room i get annoyed and finally tell them to come out now or im coming in they walk out briskly past me and toss a pair of jeans back into the pile as they move toward the door the fitting room floor wall bench all covered in blue security ink odd i walk over and inspect the jeans security tag melted jeans ruined i get up front just as they are walking into the parking lot and going for their vehicle fortunately the police showed up with the fire department i hold up the jeans to an officer and point towards them tampering with a security device destruction of property and something about use of combustible in an occupied structure needless to say they both left in the back of a cop car though had they just tried to steal the jeans and got caught they only wouldve had a minor citation and been free to go 
i caught a female customer red shoplifting last night in the gas station i manage we have an electronic ordering system for our deli that prints tickets which the customer uses to be rung up with at the register while theyre waiting for us to make their food if it doesnt get rung up itll sit in the resume sale button until its rung up or until i delete it its am and red shows up and orders food were in a bit of a rush at the moment so im in the deli helping out my associate she pays for her food and drops the slip she used to pay for it in the basket but she picked up three different orders we were busy and im not allowed to demand the customer show me their paid slip before giving them the food well red left so i go up to the register to she if the other two orders were payed for they werent at this point the shes gone already so there isnt anything i can do all i can do is wait for her to come back and watch her like a fucking hawk its now am and red actually came back to the store she just shoplifted from she grabs a couple sodas and i make sure im ringing her up my register associate noticed something was up because i kinda cut her off to the register so id be the one to ring up red me thatll be red thats pretty expensive for a couple sodas me i also rung up the hoagie you didnt pay for and the mac and cheese bowl you didnt pay for earlier redare you sure i didnt pay for that me completely if it was paid for i wouldnt be able to resume the ticket from the register for the same order number you had with the same order you ordered red im going to kill him why didnt he pay for it ill go get him me if you leave before paying im going to call the cops for shoplifting i already had my fuel associate write down your tags red fine she payed with a hundred dollar bill and she was clearly a junkie we get them all the time normally i dont get wins like this we arent technically allowed to confront shoplifters im supposed to just call the cops and give all the information to them but that doesnt ever pan out and it doesnt feel good

im interning at a museum for the summer and one day a week i work the front desk during that ampm timespan i am the only person who is on two main floors and often the only staff member in the whole place my bosses are wonderful people with a sense of humor and always back me in whatever i need to do its basically a resort town filled with upper middle to upper class tourists in the summer mostly from boston who are some of the most self entitled people ive ever met in my life i have tons of examples and this is just one of them it was a particularly slow day before the season really started so it was nearly noon before the first guests came in id been chatting with one of our docents who thankfully served as witness to the whole thing a group of nine came in and i immediately knew there was going to be trouble there was just a way that they was looking down their noses at everything those are always the problem ones the obvious leader was a year old woman dressed to the nines like she was some sort of kennedy i launched into my normal greeting good afternoon how are you would you like to tour the museum today she looked at me like i was the lowest speck of dirt on her shoes yes you dont have to take that attitude we are going to tour the museum and it will be free i was a little shocked the docent whos been volunteering since the s said we have free weekends once every couple of months but other than that there is an admission fee its very small and it goes to help further education for the local area faux kennedy lady snorted yes but we will get in for free you understand do you have anyone more respectful to give a tour miss this is our only docent for the day and if you would like to go further than the front desk you all will have to pay an admission fee unless you are active duty military a museum member or under the age of no we wont because we will get in free we are special guests of the director she was completely certain i was going to cave and the polo bedecked clan of family she had with her was crowding around like they were trying to physically intimidate me if you are a special guest i have to approve that through the director of the museum let me just call him as i grabbed the phone she continued talking to be like the was negotiating with a deaf monkey my boss said hed be up in a few seconds and i held them off just wandering into the building by showing them greeting cards there was a firefighters benefit going on that night after hours and some of the guys were there setting up so trailing just behind our museum director were two young large firefighters there to help move things in the front hall i presented the group as the directors special guests the director was very friendly shaking their hands they kept glancing at me with this look in their eyes like theyd won finally the director said with a big smile on his face not losing a beat from his friendly demeanor please leave you have had your opportunity to visit with us and you have tarnished it we welcome you to come back another day possibly a free family weekend have a lovely day then he went back downstairs leaving me with two large firefighters making a wall preventing them from going further inside faux kennedy lady huffed then stormed out yelling something about being the ruin of all of us the firefighters brought the docent and i sweet tea and chili as thanks for a great story it was delicious
