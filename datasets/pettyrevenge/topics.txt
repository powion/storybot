i am driving to work a few months ago and getting close i have two turns remaining until i turn into the building it is just a few blocks away all side streets no highways involved this guy behind me is in a black bmw and he is on my ass the whole time i see him checking his phone then making angry faces at me and getting closer and closer i speed up a bit thinking it might calm him down over nope anyway i make the first turn and am now on the street where my building is maybe yards up ahead the asshole is still behind me driving inches from behind me and obviously pissed that i am still going the speed limit maybe on this street so i speed up a bit and see he does the same i drive an eight year old toyota truck not one of the big huge ones but not one of the small ones i do have all terrain tires and i have certainly driven through pastures over rocks popped a curb or in my time my suspension is in good shape and have no problem treating my decade old truck like a truck well as i get closer to my building there is a large speed bump in the street effectively to get people to slow down as they approach the parking garage entrances i look back and see asshole still riding my bumper i remember thinking to myself i need to slow down for this speed bump and looking back and thinking if i hit my brakes this guy is going to hit me the plan takes shape in my mind and i speed up i am doing about when i hit that speed bump and yeehaw i did a bit of a jump and land never once touching my brakes didnt even tap them i gave him zero warning for what was about to happen i am watching my rearview window intensely during this because i wanted to see his reaction he was cradling his cell phone between his ear and shoulder when he hit his hood bucked up behind me then slams to the ground i see him go flying out of his seat straight up he slams his head on the roof of his bmw and his head rolls sideways from impact then he slams back into his seat violently he has a total wtf was that look on his face as he grabs the wheel with both hands to recover and yes he slowed right the fuck down after that
so a while back i was given a uga bulldogs flag and a flag pole to mount it on my porch our homeowners association hoa restrictions say that sports team flags can only be flown on a day in which the team is playing my intention was to only fly it on saturdays when the football team was playing so i put the flag up on a saturday the dawgs were playing but forgot to take it down until monday on friday i get a letter from the hoa stating that i am in violation of the restriction and could be fined okay fair enough they are correct on this one i then noticed that the date of observation was on wednesday i called and said that couldnt be true because i took it down on monday instead of admitting her mistake she lied and said that she had seen it up on wednesday now i was mad i printed off a schedule of every sporting event the bulldogs had in every sport even club sports and then proceeded to fly the flag every single day there was any kind of game match regatta etc which was almost every single day i then started getting letters stating i was in violation again i would call on each one and explain that the water polo team had a match or the rowing team had a regatta on those days after about a month or two of this back and forth they finally gave up 
so this just happened and the woman is still shooting me dirty looks so i decided that i wanted to go see the martian today i took the bus and ended up showing up minutes early so i was the only one in the theater for a good minutes so i took my time picking out my ideal spot i decided to go the bathroom before the movie so i didnt miss anything on my way back with a soft pretzel in hand i see the a woman with her kids and shes moving all of my stuff to a different seat so her and her kids can take my spot i stomach it grab my stuff and move to a different spot while im sitting there eating my pretzel i notice her and her kids all going to the bathroom i seize the opportunity i run grab all their stuff and move it to seats right in front of the entrance so theyll see it as soon they walk in i then reclaim my rightful place in my perfect spot the lady comes in sees her stuff looks at me connects the dots and now has been shooting the occasional death glance from the front row and every other spot filled up tldr went to the movies women stole my spot now has a terrible spot edit despite the hate that i may get for saying this i just hit my own front page o 
so i posted on here a little while ago about my room mate using up all my baby wipes and he said to me he would stop well the past days he started doing it again along with using my tooth paste and not even fucking being kind enough to put the cap back on after using it so i confronted him about this again and he said whatever i dont give a shit hide it somewhere then nah nah i will keep it there i have an idea a couple days ago he said he has a girl coming over and would like to get some action and leave him alone i said ok no worries so about an hour before she came over i pretended to leave and said i am heading out for the night minutes later i snuck back in while he was making dinner for the both of them i got to my room and hid in there knowing that for a fact at some point in the night she would ask to use the bathroom and i needed to take a shit so minutes goes by and she arrived and i am just waiting about hours after she gets there i hear him go take a piss ah perfect he went first now time to take a big fat fucking shit i run into the bathroom and crap as quiet as i possibly can a huge load and i dont flush or put the lid down i go back to my room and wait i stare at the clock and sit there giggling like quagmire exactly minutes go by and whoooop there she goes into the bathroom she was in there for exactly seconds and came out minutes later she leaves guess who isnt getting any pussy

so i live next door to a couple a very conservative couple and their twin boys the boys cant be more than and like most kids they like to play in the back yard which is totally fine doesnt bother me at all theyre kids and like to run around what bothers me though is that they love to throw their toys over into my yard alot of toys action figures balls frisbees rackets etc them throwing them over dont even really bother me that much what bothers me is that the parents keep demanding that we have to throw them back they dont ask they dont knock on the door and apologize they just yell over there fence when they know that we are outside and tell us to give it back and that bothers me they also seem to encourage their kids to throw it over to our yard so after christmas i was at the store and saw that they had a ton of barbies nail polish bratz doll frisbees and balls on the clearance i bought of everything i could find that i knew my neighbors would hate seeing their sons play with every time an action figure gets thrown over to my yard i will throw a barbie back with it every time a ball gets thrown a bratz ball will be returned i already threw a couple nail polishes over and the twins went crazy they loved it theyve had pink purple and green nails all week its been days and not a single action figure has crossed my fence more importantly not a single rude demand from the parents to return them the kids are having fun and i have pretty revenge

 years ago when i was in th grade my sister who was at the time built a giant snowman after an unusually heavy pennsylvania snow she spent all day on this thing and it was actually pretty impressive the town im from is actually a borough and it only has something like people who live there meaning high school classes were small and relatively tightknit there was one particular kid who ill call scotty who drove me up the fucking wall he never did anything to me personally but he just had a massively annoying way about him to make matters worse it seemed as if i had way too many classes with him to be statistically possible one of scottys irritating behaviors is that he drove a loud redneckish johndeeregreen truck it was obnoxious as hell and important to the story later had a huge brush guard on the front of it well on the evening after she built her snowy sentinel i heard the sound of scottys truck making its way down the street from inside our livingroom then i heard the pfft of someone running over a snowman and laughing unfortunately for my sister she had built it close to the road and too easily within the range of this semiguided asshole she was rather upset to see her days work splattered all over the street something needed to be done about this so the next morning i woke up early and began building another snowman it was glorious i made the classic three section scarfwearing sticksforarmsandvegetablesforaface snowman this new snowmans cheery countenance betrayed a grim and dark secret however frosty was built on top of a fire hydrant at the corner of our yard where there was no curb for a good two days i dreamt of scotty wrapping his stupid truck around my masterpiece out in the yard but no dice i didnt see him at all anywhere around town so i thought i was out of luck then on the evening of the th day i heard it my family was eating dinner and i heard the low grumble of fates motors kicking from gear to gear would they find themselves abruptly halted in about seconds it all depends on you scotty boy so i start chewing my food really fast because knowing the idiot i knew what was happening next the final acceleration sounded off like a chaotic crescendo as he plowed straight intonot throughthe snowman with the deafening crunch of twisting metal my family ran outside and it took everything i had to not laugh before i got out there there stood scotty dazed and bewildered and caughtoff guard by a battle that he lost before he realized it had begun 
good god i wish i found this subreddit sooner i love it so much so one of my best friends from my freshman year of college is a bouncer at a popular bar on campus and once in a while if theres a concert i like hell set aside a few free tickets for me as long as i let him know in advance and usually i pay him back with drinks food whatever my girlfriend is a major skrillex fan eh whatever i like edm but i dont like that broy kinda dubstep it turns out a couple of her friends in class were too so she asked me if i could get my friend to give her and her friends four tickets i was wary because i didnt know these chicks and they looked bitchy but i trusted her judgment i talked to my friend got the tickets and gave them to my girlfriend it turns out that my girlfriend trusted these bitches too much because she gave them the tickets to hold on to since one of them was going to drive everyone you could use the bus system but this was february and it was too cold to wait outside naturally shit goes south and my girlfriend is calling me crying a few hours before the concert saying that the girls just ditched her and decided to bring a different friend instead now i was driving home for the weekend but as soon as i heard this i called my dad and told him id be a day late as soon as i explained the situation he laughed because he knew i was going to do something or the other in response i called my bouncer friend an hour and a half before doors opened once id reached campus again i let him know about the situation and since these tickets were those print out and scan the bar code kind he just cancelled those four tickets and actually printed out two new ones specifically for me and my girl i picked them up myself and he told me hed kick my ass if i let anyone have them this time my girlfriend was so excited when i told her this and we both quickly got ready well i quickly got ready we showed up right as the doors were going to open ready to hear a bass drop so sick it would make ebola seem like a cold as we showed up there was naturally a long as hell line and luckily about twenty people in front of us were those bitches as soon as the doors opened they started letting people in scanning tickets and checking ids once the bitches were getting their tickets scanned the bouncer my friend saw from the error that these were the tickets that were the ones stolen he saw me a little bit behind and told them to wait on the side while he let in the next few people after the next ten people they start whining and complaining that they should be let in because theyre going to lose good spots he tells them theres an issue with their tickets and once my girlfriend and i show up they immediately shut the fuck up and their faces turned really white he scans our tickets says to them oh look these were the tickets you girls wanted werent they and they just stormed out of line pissed as hell as they left i yelled if you want you can just sit by the walls and feel the bass from there i was kidding but honestly skrillex uses way too much bass for my taste holy shit my heart was shaking during that concert tldr some bitches tried to use my girlfriend to get free tickets out of me so i fucked them over and enjoyed a wub wub concert and yes my dad had a great laugh when i went home the next day edit weary of learning how to spell words correctly edit im going to be perfectly honest this past week has been rough with work and research and i just wanted to post this to feel happy about something but all your responses are just so uplifting thank you for the gold and thank you all for the support i promise that as soon as the proposal happens ill let you all know edit yes i forgot the month of the concert i just remembered it was winter so naturally i assume december thanks to the pitchforks edit relatosalvajes big thanks for correcting my confusing mistake with the half hour 
i saw how you parallel parked like a decent human being nice and snug with the car in front of you realizing he had a no parking zone in front of him and thus plenty of room to pull out forward little did you know that the man that would pull up behind you wouldnt give you the same courtesy pulling up within a half inch of your rear bumper effectively trapping you between two cars i saw your look of frustration as you came back out to your car and realized the situation and then your look of resigned determination as you entered your vehicle the red of your brake lights released and you gently bumped backwards into the offending car a slight pull forward careful enough not to tap the innocents in front of you another reverse and satisfying bump to the luxury car behind you your shitty s cavalier didnt care another slow ease forward and then totally unnecessarily one more hearty bump to the douchebagmobile before you head off into the night i saw it all and i approve edit not to be that guy but you all made my by far highest karma post be about petty revenge for a bad parking job id just like to say thanks and park safe
so about a week ago i find myself in downtown austin visiting my soon to be married best friend who has asked me to be the best man we have plans to rent a beach house and everyone chipped in about to buy alcohol for the bachelor party i had been procrastinating and was running out of time i saw this sushi restaurant downtown and thought ill park next door in this liquor stores parking lot by all the alcohol for the trip and then surely theyll let me park there and go eat lunch i ring up worth of scotch bourbon vodka and beer and then proceed to pay the old man at the counter looked like he had the personality of a celery stick when i got my reciept and everything was loaded into about cardboard boxes i asked him hey man do you mind if i stay parked here for about minutes while i run next door and get lunch he looked at me over the boxes of all this liquor and flatly said no unless youre just getting it to go and youll be back in five minutes or less ill tow you i looked him dead in the eyes and said might i inquire as to your return policy then he looked at me confused as if he didnt understand the question i said id like all of my money back sir thats when it clicked and he tried to offer the parking spot to me like i had initially requested seeing going up in smoke no dice jack i made him painstakingly rescan everything while i stared him down tldr buy worth of liquor ask manager to use parking spot to grab lunch next door he refuses i return all the alcohol and ask for my money back edit changed starred him down to stared him down thanks ulmgs
a couple months ago i was on a hour bus ride when i was seated by a woman from hell when i boarded the bus i was told that it wasnt fully booked so i assumed it would be alright if i left my backpack and personal items on the seat beside me so no one would sit with me i normally wouldnt do this but i am someone who gets extremely motion sick no amount of meds or other remedies seems to help and since this bus ride was going through the mountains i thought id save someone the trouble of sitting next to a puking feverish girl anyways i rode like this for about an hour and half the bus was empty so i thought it didnt matter then out of nowhere a woman across from me starts looking back and me sending me death glares over and over at this point we are slowly moving into the foothills of the mountains so i ignore her trying to focus on relaxing and not letting the nausea overwhelm me after about minutes she comes over and says excuse me im going to sit here pointing at the seat next to me i give her a look of frustration but being the nonconfrontational person i am i moved my stuff off the seat and allowed her to sit there despite empty seats around us intentionally i scatter my stuff on the floor just enough so her feet dont have quite as much room as they should hoping this would persuade her to leave nope she begins kicking my things hard i ask her very politely not to kick my things she looks at me with moral outrage little girl you dont own this fucking bus give me my fucking space i am years old you little indian bitches seem to think you own this fucking country so the realization sets in that this woman is a racist bitch who intentionally sat with me to bitch me out i am really a canadian citizen born and raised here however i am brown because my mother is a filipina anyways i tell her there is no need to be so hostile and as she begins to snort rude remarks back to me i put on my headphones and blast the loudest radiohead songs i can find just to bug her at this point the anger boiling up inside of me and the nausea are beginning to get to me so i decide it is best to ignore her but she wont let that happen she begins elbowing me hard then kicking my leg i finally give in and take of my headphones she demands that i turn down my music i demand that she leaves me alone suddenly from the corner of my eye i see her opening her water bottle and pouring it all over my backpack and personal belongings i push it out of her hands at which point she begins screaming obscenities at me telling me i am abusing a poor elderly woman with back problems that im taking up too much space that i am part of the indian problem that is destroying our respectable nation at this point the anxiety and the mountainous bus ride is just too much to bear as she screams at me i realize i need to throw up and although i could interrupt her to quickly run to the bathroom i instead decide it was okay if i just let it go in her lap i am terribly sick so i end up vomiting almost an entire sandwich onto her she stops for a moment out of shock and then begins to hit me as hard as she fucking can i am a tiny little half asian girl who weighs less than lbs and shes huge people around who have been hearing her bullshit finally at this point call for the bus driver who pulls the bus over in the town we are passing through the woman demands i be removed from the bus for elderly abuse the other passengers back me up and defend me after witnessing the insanity the police are called and the woman is escorted off the bus literally kicking and screaming about how indians should be banned from public transit last i see of her she is being held by police on the side of the road covered in vomit as much as i believe you shouldnt vomit on people on purpose i must admit that my motion sickness has never felt so good before also i ended up getting a coupon for a free ticket with the bus company as an apology for what happened which was only an added bonus tldr racist woman sits beside me in almost empty bus terrorizes me for so long that i vomit in her lap forcibly removed from the bus by police for being a racist bitch ha edit so many people are asking me why didnt you just get up and move to a different seat my answer is i probably should have but i am easily intimidated and i was just hoping that shed leave me alone once she started acting nasty then it became an issue of pride i didnt want her to get her way so in my passiveaggressive sort of way i was fighting back by not switching seats also i was feeling so ill i probably would have vomited anyway had i attempted to gather my things and move i cant say it was the right thing to do or worth it but thats how it happened i have social anxiety so i get very nervous and dont think clearly in such situations

best buy at a big mall circling the parking lot for literally a half hour looking for a spot since my roommate insisted she couldnt go shopping alone finally found a spot in the way back of the parking lot doesnt matter i wait for the car leaving the spot to exit turn signal on he leaves and as i begin to pull in someone whips out from behind me and makes it into the spot before i can almost hitting my car in the process and scaring the shit out of me but he moved so quickly to get my spot that he ended up parking crookedly and couldnt exit his car so i just pulled up behind him now he couldnt adjust and he was too heavy to climb across to the passenger door though he did attempt it he was giving me the middle finger and shouting at me to move so he could readjust i literally stayed there for minutes to my roommates annoyance until he called security who asked me to move when i told security what had happened he made the guy leave the parking space or be ticketed fantastic got my spot
i scored an awesome parking spot today i mean really awesome im surprised its not a handicapped spot honestly while leaving the store this couple in a giant suv is cruising down the aisle awesome i think to myself theyll love my spot its a hotass day and the lot is packed while im loading my bags into the car though they creep alongside my vehicle and the woman in the passenger seat shouts hurry it up already right im sorry im a sucker for helping folks out but the minute someone pushes me i push right back so i hop on into my car start the engine crank the ac and hop on here to post this the suv is still there even crept forward a couple of times to make sure i can see them think i may browse a bit longer now assholes 
i guess this belongs here i got petty revenge by merely existing at a past job i had a long commute it was miles door to door to save money i bought an early s rabbit diesel from an old man for mpg and it ran like a top however it was gutless and some of this commute was through the foothills of the colorado front range some of the larger hills would slow my top speed to about on this mph interstate i can handle this just fine especially with the money it saved me however even though this is a three lane hiway and i kept to the right of the time never even tried to pass people on the very rare occasion it was an option some people would still honk angrily or flip me off when they came up behind me i was somehow inconveniencing them to force them to pass bear in mind my shift did not make me commute in rush hours there was little to no traffic one guy lost his everloving mind honking and flipping me off he paced in the next lane becide me for a while foaming and spitting screaming and using every rude gesture in the book completely lost it then he moved on a few minutes later i arrive at work and my boss asks me to sit in on a interview as the tech interviewer i settle in and wait the first smiling candidate that walks in looks at me and loses his smile it is mr foaming nutbag without saying a word he turns and walks back out i spend the next minutes giggling while i explain to the boss what just happened tldr sometimes karma is a bitch
im riding my bike home on the shoulder of a major roadway when a white suv drives past and the front passenger screams extremely loudly in an attempt to scare me as is sadly common behavior for dumb teenagers normally a pretty immature yet innocuous lark i took a bit more offense because its pretty malicious to try and startle someone who is riding a bike adjacent to highway traffic they took the exit directly in front of me which was a loop to an overpass with a lane to go straight and a lane to bear right at the end of the overpass i just so happen to be taking this exit as well and as luck would have it white suv is between two other cars in the straight on lane window still rolled down while i need to turn right i slow down so ill pass right by their car just as their light turns green and when i pass by i scream as loudly as i fucking can directly into their window while i rolled past in the brief moment i glimpsed at least one starbucks cup fly into the air both guilty parties scream the suv lurch forward from a panicbrakeapplication and what fear truly looks like in a teenaged girls eyes
back in college i went to a large university that stretched over three towns so getting from one side to the other was quite a hike one day after i had parked in the student lot and was walking to class i hear a car honking and a woman yelling hey you now this sounded like some loud mouth trying to get their friends attention so i ignored it until it happened again much closer to me i turned and see a woman with her window rolled down looking at me rather annoyed i need directions to college hall she made no attempt being cordial at all whatever ill help her out anyway i start thinking about the best way to get her there and raise my right arm to start pointing her in the right direction when she snaps her fingers at me hurry up i have an interview to get to and youre making me late oh hell no if you had an interview you should have arrived early thats standard procedure or at least in my book it is i didnt say this of course instead i slowly lowered my right arm and raised my left college hall is right past those dorms its a big white building right behind the tree line you cant miss it theres nothing past the tree line except for more trees as she parked and walked quickly off without a thank you or even a look of gratitude i called out good luck with your interview i chuckled to myself for the rest of day tldr woman snaps her fingers rudely and asks for directions i point her in the opposite direction 
i used to work for the largest company in the world by market cap and know quite a bit about their electronic gadgets this has earned me the unfortunate family title as tech support for all things fruit related last week i received a call from my brother asking if i could fix his friends phone as it was acting weirdly i told him to come by my place and i would get it sorted out well this friend of my brothers is and kind of a little douche ld he also smokes far too much weed to ever be healthy nothing against the stuff but seriously too much is too much anyways they come by stoned out of their mind right as i finish making myself some delicious baked spaghetti for dinner i proceed to update his phone to the new os and fix his issues which was an app that required an update to the latest os version to work properly and all is ready to go i come back to find my baked spaghetti completely devoured by ld while my brother was playing video games in the living room you motherfucker so i went into the settings and now his phone autocorrects tired to high every time he types it in that way every time he types i am too tired it becomes i am too high etc give him the phone back and say all is fixed two days later i get a text message asking wtf because his friend is grounded for telling his parents he was too high to go to a family dinner never eat my goddamn spaghetti edit thank you all for making this delicious revenge my top post ever a few of you have asked me a main question andor called me out on this being fake i would like to provide some proof in the form of my x pan being completely devoid of spaghetti found in this picture finally for the question how did he find out why text brother what happened after etc after texting his message to his parents which by the way he uses the tired excuse on a constant basis to get out of shit he doesnt want to do he tried to correct himself by typing tired which kept correcting to high over and over again cue my fucking lolz it looked something like this gtim too high to go to dinner sorry guys gttoo high gttoo high gtfuck too t i r e d at this point his parents had already called him and chewed his ass out of course afterwards he called my brother saying that his phone was super broken now and explained the situation to him brother immediately knew what i had done ive done similar things to him before and texted me with the wtf i then sent him the above picture of me having no spaghetti that i was pissed and he deserved my sweet tear induced justice
my so decided he didnt want to go on the date we had been planning for over a week because he was too tired he was too tired because he had stayed up late redditing and playing games if youre reading this i drank the last of your chocolate milk it was delicious 
when i was in college i worked the night shift at a gas station one night a group of high school kids drove in and it looked like they were on a double date they were apparently running on fumes and badly needed gas but didnt have much cash between them they all came in and emptied the change from their pockets onto the counter and came up with total i punch in as the prepay amount for their gas and the nice girl who was driving was appreciative that i had helped count out the change there were a lot of pennies after this the girls go to use the bathroom while the boys peruse the small store the aisles are angled towards the register so that i can look down them pretty easily i see one of the boys clearly take a snickers bar and place it into his jacket pocket he made absolutely no attempt to hide this action i was about to call him out on it but remembered that they hadnt started pumping their gas yet as they were walking out the door have a good night i cleared out the prepay amount and typed in subtracting the that i knew the candy bar cost i then waited for the fun the nice girl starts pumping her gas and when the pump stopped at she looks at me through the glass and raises her hand to make the international gesture for wtf i motion for her to come inside and shes a bit annoyed until i explain that her friend stole a candy bar so i took the price of the candy bar off of the total amount the look of incandescent rage that crossed her face was beautiful she took that anger back out to the car and opened the passenger door even though i couldnt hear her i could see her yell animatedly with her hands and soon she started walking back to the store candy bar in hand she placed the candy bar on the counter and said thank you i put back on the pump i could see her still yelling at him as she finished pumping the gas and drove off tldr high school boy steals a candy bar and i let his date know about it in my own way 
i live in the same building that i work in i manage a sandwich shop in a heavily urban area the landlord of the building is an angry old man who we all love but can be crotchety at times he took upon himself to remove the bike rack in front of my building illegally his thinking was it would cut down on people leaning on it to smoke cigarettes so i emailed the department of transportation stating that if they continue to be removed well potentially miss out on business from cyclist on the theory that if they have no place to securely lock up their bikes my landlord is on vacation when he comes back on wednesday there will be a brand new foot bike rack installed directly in front of the building courtesy of the city edit spelling
ill start off by saying that i take pride in cooking customers orders to perfection and i strive to always make the customer happy its hard to do that when the person calls back every time no matter what and says that we messed their order up in some way well today sir today was your last meal from us i deleted your account and blocked all of your numbers that you have ever called us from when you call you will get a never ending elevator music tone i also took the liberty of emailing every pizza place in a mile radius of our store to inform them of your selfish habit i told them what you do and how many times you have done it to us hope you like chinese food from now on fucker

he knew i had to work the next day he knew i absolutely hated those particular friends and he knew i hate surprise guests so i just went in the bedroom and tried to sleep unsuccessfully this guy is a massively neurotic neat freak he is physically unable to relax in a room that is not clean to his standards so after he finally passed out i went into the kitchen and poured maple syrup all over the floor and told him one of his idiot friends did it he just about had a panic attack it took him hours to get rid of the sticky those friends were never invited back edit this happened years ago we are long since broken up to those of you saying i should have just talked to him i did goddamn times this guy was an enormous scum bag so all of you telling me what a bitchcuntwhatever i am fuck you too also i am a guy so your misogyny is wasted on me i poured syrup on the floor ffs he was inconvenienced for a few hours give me a break the panic attack line was a hyperbole finally thank you to all the people who understand the point of this sub edit dont worry canada it wasnt real maple syrup and thanks again for all the nice comments
ok this may be an example of preemptive revenge but considering how it happened im still pretty sure i was entirely in the right not sure how petty it was but anyways in elementary school i wasnt the most popular kid i was into books had big glasses into video games got very grades classic nerd i had friends sure but i did tend to be the butt of the classic nerdykid jokes one day in class we were doing some sort of busy work and i was seated across from one of the girls lets call her bitchj who always loved to make fun of me and give me crap the girl for some reason was stamping her feet up and down on the floor like a crazy person not just the nervous knee thing that most people get from time to time full on lifting and dropping them fuckers the massive shockwaves from her dinosaur stomping ending up knocking her glasses off the desk and somewhere right beneath her feet being the good guy that i was i immediately yelled out bitchj stop watch your feet she stops her foot a few inches from her glasses then looks at me and just asks why now i could have told her that she was about to ruin her glasses but for some reason i didnt i happened to not be wearing my own glasses at the time and on a lark i told her youre about to step on my glasses the bitch got the biggest grin on her face lifted her foot back up and smashed it back down onto her own glasses bitchj heard them crack and bent down to pick the glasses up still grinning at me without breaking her gaze when she lifted the glasses up and looked at them and realized they were her own she started crying loudly ran to the teacher it was wonderful
at work i measure out two ounces of cashews in little bags the bag itself weighs ounces so i usually do or ounces to make up for it a lady asks me for a bag of warm cashews i hand her one and ring her up she holds them in her hand and tells me that that is not two ounces maam i assure you they are two ounces i measured them myself she does not believe me and asks for me to measure them in front of her i put the bag on the scale and it measures ounces so i say oh looks like you have a little more so i remove a single cashew from the bag and hand it back to her she was not happy and refused to buy the cashews but it was worth it

yesterday i was shopping at a pretty busy walmart right after work with the gf we were getting a few cheap bar stools for our new apartment self checkout was pretty packed so i went to the items or less line that only had people in it i notice some commotion coming from the person in front of the old lady in front of me with the cashier the cashier politely asked for his women in her early s if she can go in one of the other lines that have way more counter space for ringing things up i felt like that was a reasonable request because her cart was so full of food and clothing i was surprised it wasnt falling out the sides well this lady flat out refused stating i waited my turn in line you have to ring me up or im complaining to your manager the cashier folded and started to ring up her items soon the small counter space was filled up and so was the bagging area but this womens cart was still half full she complained once more scowling and saying cant you hurry it up a bit i need to beat rushour traffic so i can make dinner in time for church ash wednesday was yesterday when this happened the cashier then says this would take less time if you went to the regular lanes where they have a bagger at this point the old lady in front of me just leaves the line to go to a different line to get her bananas my girlfriend is getting annoyed at this point and wants to switch too but im a pretty patient person my girlfriend starts making passive aggressive remarks loud enough for the lady in front to hear but not to her face stuff along the lines of i hate those idiots who take hundreds of items to the express lane you could tell this lady heard it because she started getting flustered about minutes later she finally finished after we had finished packing up our car and heading for the exit we saw that lady putting the last of her groceries in her minivan i decided to slow to a stop in front of her car blocking her in and turn the car off i told my gf to be patient for a few minutes and winked that our battery had died i hopped out of the car popped the hood and disconnecting the battery this lady starts honking like crazy so i turned to her and just shrugged she got out of her car yelling at me to move i told her no can do the car just died and wont start up i pretended to call a tow truck and told her she would have to wait min for it to get there this lady had a mental breakdown started cussing me out and eventually climbed back in her car around min later the people in the car in front of her got back and started unloading their groceries she started honking and yelling at them to hurry up amazingly this just made them go slower they eventually finished and pulled out and the rude lady was free to go i reconnected the battery after she left and laughed about it with my gf all the way home 
i was hiring for a level tech position at a carrier that i worked at by day while i contracted out on the side by night one of my customers had a former employee who had not yet had his vpn access disabled who logged in and destroyed a lot of their infrastructure which i had to repair we worked through the night until the next morning to rebuild it so ive been interviewing people here and there and this guy comes in with a seemingly good resume so i give him an interview when i asked him some technical questions about complex things hed worked on he described a setup that was identical to the one i had to repair and it was a pretty unusual setup i quickly texted the owner of the other company and sure enough it was the same guy on a hunch i texted a girl i knew shed had a boyfriend whod gotten her pregnant and bailed leaving her with a lease to pay on her own id only ever heard about him by first name but he fitted the physical description it was the same fucking guy no shit i decided to waste his time with the longest most stressful awkward and technically difficult job interview ive ever given before giving him real hope that he was the best candidate and would most likely get the job and that for the right person wed pay for their moving expenses and pay above what was advertised with bonuses and perks i never called him to let him know he was very very unsuccessful and let him sit for weeks thinking he was getting his dream job fuck that guy for those asking for proof the incident ended up used on our corporate web site as a case study with testimonial edit for common questions he wasnt pursued legally because he took out the servers that logged all the firewall activity we realised what he was doing while he was still doing it but were unable to save everything as while the production data was being backed up offsite live diagnostictroubleshooting stuff like logs werent all we had was his vpn being connected which wasnt enough to be sure on and it would raise questions with pcidss requirements for storing credit card information yes it is just an incredible coincidence that he also knocked up a friend she ended up miscarrying so dont worry he has not reproduced edit for additional info part of the most awkward interview ever was when i spent a lot of time in the interview talking about how familiar that setup sounded and that id done some contract work to do some emergency repairs for a setup just like it a while ago he tensed like a conjugated verb
sorry for the length i had a lot to get off my chest back story when i was my mom got married to a halfway decent guy hes not bad but hes not great either but he made my mom happy and thats all that i cared about in fact i cared so much about her happiness that i was willing to endure years of living under the same roof as his selfobsessed obnoxious spoiled daughter amy the entire time we lived together she would project all of her insecurities onto me in the form of insults being young and wildly insecure about myself these daily insults well and truly cut me to the core and just continued the cycle of crippling insecurity when i started talking to a boy for the first time kyle she all of a sudden developed an intense infatuation with him and told me i was forbidden from communicating with him from then on i was insecure but i was not a pushover when i didnt listen to her demands she took it a step further and told kyle i had ongoing relationships with several other boys untrue which he unfortunately believed i was completely crushed she then swooped in and took every opportunity to rub it in my face that she won him ie inviting him to my birthday parties at home inviting me out with her only to later reveal i would be thirdwheeling on their date making him compliment me and then gloating about how she had such a nice boyfriend etc this sort of thing happened countless times not with just boys but with friends and even workplaces they ended up dating for two years and although they had a nasty breakup kyle and i remained on good terms which drove her up the wall she would constantly ask me so did you guys hook up behind my back yet while claiming to have moved on already when we finally graduated high school we were in the same year i could not be happier to move out and go to college while i was finally living the life i wanted without her toxicity she went to different unaccredited schools both of which she dropped out of after semester at each eventually she moved back in with our parents in our hometown and fell into her old ways again assuming she had ever grown out of them on the eve of her th birthday she posted to fb about how her friends had gifted her a fake id and raved about their plans to club hop for her birthday even though i lived mi away she still had to find some way to rub it in my face that i would be missing out on all the fun i was invited to her birthday event page on fb where she detailed all the extravagant and expensive things she planned for her special day were talking limo rental vip rooms at of the biggest clubs in town and even some photographer guy who would follow them like paparazzi she made a public post on the event page where she tagged me and said its going to be amazing too bad youll miss out haha youll have to wait years before you can experience any of this it had been about a year since i had last seen or spoken to her by this point i was at a much happier place with myself emotionally it took me a while to shake off the effects of her emotional abuse but by god i did it and i wasnt going to let her drag me back to those lows again but this post got me to reminisce about all the things that she had done to me in the past and i couldnt help but feel a boiling rage inside now unbeknownst to her kyle had recently reconnected with me on fb it only friendly conversation between us catching up on each others lives until he suggested we meet up and have lunch he went to another college an hour away lunch turned into us having an afternoonlong shittalkingfest about amy he confessed that she was emotionally abusive to him during their relationship and the only time they didnt fight was when i was in their company which is why he didnt mind me thirdwheeling on all those dates apparently during this he also confessed he had feelings for me but couldnt forgive himself for letting amy dangle him in front of me because he knew that i had liked him this guilt was apparently something he had been carrying for years and finally found the courage to apologize for now revenge heres where we get petty i convinced kyle to alert his brother who happened to be the marketing director for one of the clubs amy had reserved a vip room at of these upcoming birthday plans after he did that i went home and called the limousine rental company and pretended to be a concerned parent and insisted no alcohol be available since several of the girls were underage they let me know that they were very appreciative of the notice and then i did a little digging and found out who the paparazzi guy would be and called him to cancel his services for the event with her birthday coming up in just a couple of days i sat back and waited to let the chips fall where they may and it was better than i could have hoped for when i asked about it a few days afterwards she was sure to screech every beautiful detail to me over the phone since the limo did not provide them with alcohol they stopped by a friends house to pregame and sneak in their own supply once the driver noticed the gaggle of very drunk girls in his limo he stopped and made them throw away all of the liquor they snuck in when they got to the first club kyles brother who knew amy as kyles ex confronted them at the door and told them there was no way in hell they were getting in this was very upsetting to these group of drunk girls and they all proceeded to make a huge drunken scene going so far as showing him amys fake id to prove they were allowed inexcept the name on the id wasnt hers kyles brother or assfucker as amy called him had security forcibly remove them from the premises as the cherry on top he contacted his friends at the other clubs in town and warned them of amy and her underage entourage successfully banning her from every single dance clubbar in a mi radius she didnt even get a refund on the deposits for the vip rooms shes lucky she wasnt arrested but she still plays victim to horrible bad luck tldr evil stepsister torments me in our teen years so i ruin her last teenage birthday by getting her banned from every club in town and making her waste thousands of dollars also i fucked kyle edit thank you for the gold let me address some questions that were brought up in the comments firstly my stepdad didnt pay for a cent of this so i have absolutely no guilt about wasting any of his money amy and her friends funded the night themselves secondly there was no evil revenge fucking between kyle and me just a good ol nostringsattached tryst lastly i cancelled the camera man because i didnt want to give her anything to be happy about hahaha that is all
it was the spring of a dozen or so brighteyed junior high students eagerly listened as our social studies teacher gave us an important assignment each of us had to write a letter to a government official on a subject of our choice some students wrote to representative lois capps others wrote to senator barbara boxer i decided to write to the big man himself president george w bush this was pre bush was just beginning his first term i wrote him a letter with my ideas on how to improve the public school system i was courteous and respectful throughout the letter this was the president i was writing to after all another student also wrote to bush she her parents supported al gore and she made sure that bush knew it she started her letter by letting him know that her family did not vote for him nor do they support him the rest of the letter was filled with similar statements along with her own plans to fix the public school system a month passed thankyou letters from senators and representatives trickled in to the junior high then a plain white envelope from pennsylvania avenue arrived for the girl that wrote president bush with a smug look on her face she opened up a thankyou letter from the president that started with gtdear student thank you for writing also enclosed was a walletsized picture of the president my letter from the white house came the same day instead of a plain envelope i received a large manila envelope enclosed was a letter that started with gtdear friend thank you for writing included was an enormous x portrait of the president this was too much for the girl to handle it was bad enough for her to receive a smaller portrait than i did but the fact that bush addressed me as a friend and her as a mere student made her absolutely furious i havent kept in touch with her since then but i doubt she ever voted republican since that incident edit thank you for the gold you made my day

a long time ago eddie murphy was shooting one of his beverly hills cop movies at a location across the street from my fathers house i was a big fan at the time my father was a senior member of the staff at this location as well so he had arranged to have a little surprise for me as this was a busy city location the movie studios would have to rent space for their trailers in parking lots like where my dad worked and put a few in peoples driveways and yards our house had a very long driveway with a rear parking area which fit about trailers our neighbor had a short driveway which fit one trailer but then opened onto our lawn there were no other nearby homes with long driveways for at least a few blocks they were all much smaller properties anyway mr murphys trailer just happened to be on our neighbors driveway opening onto our front yard cool i got to see him come and go a few times and was allowed on set it was very cool watching them film and i even noticed a stunt double not wearing a watch when mr murphy was i mentioned it to the staff and they actually reshot a scene because of it i was ecstatic to have helped and yes the scene made it into the final movie anyway my dad suggested i go knock on mr murphys door and invite him and his entourage to use our pool and hot tub at the time i was in th grade so i was just a kid but i was thrilled to meet a movie star and maybe have him as a guest at our house i knocked and he answered his door and after i offered he told me to fuck off and slammed the door in my face yeah i was pretty much destroyed and went crying back to my dad my dad was slightly less than impressed and the next day at work he told the movie company what happened and that they could no longer park their trailers on the business grounds they also could no longer use our driveway and he asked my neighbors to do the same and they did they had to stop shooting for a few days to move everything as i recall the nearest location they found to fit all their trailers was about miles away i was thrilled my dad stuck up for me so eddie murphy is an asshole but he got what he deserved

my boss well call him steve is one of those guys whos always attached to his email whether hes at his desk or answering them from his phone he will stop the conversation immediately and read the email no warning the sound will go off hell stop midsentence read and reply to every email this annoys me a lot while going over a very important project well into the million dollar range and longterm im briefing him on talking points and covering the power point on the projector a few slides in he gets an email immediately steve pulls out his phone and begins reading and replying ive dealt with this for years and this is where the revenge begins im on slide and while hes buried in his phone i progress the slide to and patiently wait for him to end he looks up oblivious to my trickery mind you he has to present this within a few hours to toptier business management and this a project that weve been working on for months i finish briefing him on the rest of the slides we take lunch and eventually the guests arrive for their briefing steves taking charge of the meeting and i retreat to my office where i can still clearly watch the presentation but dont have to participate steves hobknobbing talking our guests up laughing and joking as hes talking to one particular vp he gets an email and in normal shitlord fashion he stops mid conversation and reads it the vp did not like this not one bit he interrupts steves email reply with a hand wave and a lets continue this is where i get my second idea for revenge eventually steve gets to the power point presentation yammering on like hes the one who spent all the time on the fancy flyins formatting research etc until he gets to slide i can see him pause break his jovial manner and begins reading word for word whats on the slide hes no longer chipper and poised hes floundering little does steve know that im about to launch an email war on his psyche that he is ill prepared for see since ive been in my office ive been collecting all the emails that came in that needed replies drafted the replies and have them sitting on my desktop ive ccd steve to every one of them because im just that good of an employee as he skips to the next slide i send the first email i hear his phone jingle he pauses and instinctively reaches for his phone throwing him off his presentation he looks around and then continues a minute later i send the next email then after a short pause the next and the next i can see him sweating bullets his brain imagining some catastrophic failure somewhere in our building in shipping in product sourcing etc but he cant check his emails without breaking from the presentation and pissing off the executives its still going on i have about more emails to send and he has about a hour until hell be able to slink away and cower over his phone like gollum holding the one ring im glad i went to work today edit steve is an overthetop kind of guy he wants to know everything its common for me to cc him on important emails he has not caught on yet i also fixed the spelling of gollum update i just made myself a bagel with cream cheese it was delicious the meeting is still progressing ive sent a few more emails and have drafted more update the power point is finished and ive setup the next part of the program the video conference no ones taken a break yet except steve he had to go to the bathroom and was in there for at least minutes he responded to two of my emails update steve came into the office to see if i can run for some food for everyone i told him i was really bogged down with emails but im sure i can find some time update ive sent emails to him today only directly ive rescheduled the janitorial service which was emails alone plus their responses ive sent an email to the entire staff and local regional team over people requesting computer information for a software integration project and instructed everyone to email myself and steve with their results update holy end of the world steves phone died and he forgot his charger i heard him banging around his office let out an exasperated sigh and then head for mine i quickly plugged in my company phone sure enough he wants to borrow my charger sorry steve my phones almost dead and i have a conference call in minutes the look on his face and the air of defeat around him is palpable i think hes going into withdrawal hes honestly pulled his phone from his holster three or four times either to make sure it was really dead or because hes feeling phantom vibration notifications 
a little over a year ago i had just gotten my motorcycle license and i was on my way home i wasnt driving particularly fast just some kph over the speed limit pretty normal up behind me comes a car tearing up the asphalt but im not in a hurry my bike is new and im not gonna risk a ticket just cause this guy is in a hurry he starts to come up really really close behind me just a meter or two between his front bumper and my rear wheel so now hes driving dangerously and putting me at risk so i move over to the right side of the lane and give him room to pass figuring hell go on on his jerkish way and be done with it wellnope he passes me and then slows down in front of me and starts to break at random basically trying to tick me off even more at the next traffic light i tell the guy how dangerous his driving was and that he should quit it apparently i shouldnt have because he flips his lid and starts opening his car door probably to give me a good kicking thankfully the light turns green i gun the engine now really thinking fuck traffic regulations this guys dangerous of course motorcycle in dense traffic beats a car no matter how nuts the driver is so i get away later that evening im doing grocery shopping no longer in my biking clothes and guess who i see at the checkout lane next to me yeah its the asshole im out of the store before him and heeey theres his car and i happen to have found an old parking ticket on the ground rather then keying his car i slide the paper underneath his windshield and keep my distance im gonna enjoy this little bit of payback and oh boy did i not only did he completely flip his shit about the ticket which btw has a diffrent plate number on it but apparently hes blind with rage bonus points because theres cops nearby the asshole stomps over to them and begins to rant and curse and swear at them like theres no tomorrow at first the officers try to calm him down but this guys fucking nuts so after a minute or so the officers have enough perform the most beautiful takedown ive seen in my life and put the cuffs on him he gets stuffed in the back of the van and hauled off to the station tldr i give an asshole driver a fake parking ticket guy flips his lid and gets arrested for it edit thanks for all the cool comments everyone edit most of you have enjoyed this story immensely but reasonably there have been a few comments that say that i made this up ill admit readily that its a pretty incredulous story and im glad i can enjoy telling it now i do think its unfortunate that this happened though the revenge is sweet but the dangerous situations on the road are most definately not motorcyclists are vulnerable parties in traffic and dangerous driving like this can lead to horrible accidents so i would definately prefer that this situation had never ocurred to begin with and i wouldnt wish this kind of situation to happen to anyone
ok so my sisterinlaw is engaged and the guy she is going to marry is a somewhat decent guy the only thing is he has a lot of bad tattoos im talking knuckle tattoos that say dumpster baby vampire bite marks and the web address of the guy who did his tattoos the last one is one that this story is about because my plan originally started as a joke i made that i would buy the domain when it went up for sale and put photoshopped images of him with other men so i get to know him a bit more and hes actually a good guy has kids with an ex fiance and she has been a total bitch not telling him where his kids are leaving them with a rd party when shes supposed to have them and has also left them to go allegedly buy and sell drugs she has an open case with the department of family services and she has failed drug tests twice yet still has majority custody side note this woman hates my sil with a passion making up lies and publicly making threats on social networking sites the revenge part of this story comes back to those tattoos you see he got many of them when he was with his ex so she has similar tattoos such as the vampire bites and the web address which she has on her ankle for shits and giggles i decided to look up the domain and found that it was for sale i purchased it immediately and thought about what i would put online if i hadnt just been talking to my sisterinlaw about whats going on with his kids i might have put up the pornographic photoshops and had my fun but i changed my mind and decided to make it a launch page for their wedding plans and registry so now this woman has a tattoo that links to her exs new wedding plans and eventually a nice slideshow devoted to their everlasting love tldr sister in laws fiance has an evil ex she has a web address tattooed on her ankle that expired and i bought it to put their wedding pictures online
im still basking in the warm glow of pettiness i displayed on my way home from work i noticed my gas tank almost empty so i pulled into a station behind the car in front of me there were two pumps open on the end so i kept following the car in frontuntil the car stopped at the first pump instead of pulling through to the second pump there was just enough room to squeeze my car by between the car at the first pump and a fence as im driving by i see a teenage girl give me an exaggerated sad smirk while her friend laughed wrong move ladies i pull into the second pump but i do not leave them enough room to pull by after they finish pumping gas i decided today to pay inside for my gas and take a few minutes perusing the store grabbing a soda and chatting with the clerk when i noticed the girls are done pumping their gas i walked slowly back to my car and started pumping gas as the gallons ticked by they start to realize their mistake and are getting annoyed i finished pumping my gas but as im about to get in my car i noticed my windows are awfully dirty it would be unsafe to drive without them clean but luckily the gas station has so conveniently provided a squeegee and cleaner i promptly did my duty and cleaned every window on my car as i walked to put the squeegee away i noticed the first girl flipping me off i gave her the same exaggerated sad face she showed me earlier not so funny now is it tldr two teens didnt pull through to the last pump at gas station and mocked me as i squeezed by i made sure they realized their mistake and i now have a full tank of gas a delicious soda and squeaky clean windows edit wow my first gilding im finally a cool kid thanks
long time lurker first post so excuse noobyness i hope this is petty enough for you so i was at the supermarket today collected a few things and headed for a till it was midmorning not very busy so as usual i scanned the line of tills and picked an empty one i put all my things on the belt wheeled the trolley through the other side and waitedand waitedand waited while the cashier unpacked boxes of plastic bags and hung them on hooks next to her all in all it must have taken her a couple of minutes to finish hanging those bags before she started to put my shopping through occassionally glancing up at me as if to say go on say something well i can be failrly laid back and a minute or two is no big deal but that glance well so i started packing my things as she rang them through cashiers are pretty fast and i normally stop packing to pay so they can finish the transaction while i finish the packing but today i slowed downa lot after she finished scanning she had to wait for some time as i carried on packing very carefully intent on finishing it before i made any inclination to pay did she offer to help pack no instead she huffed and puffed at the delay there was nobody else in the queue so i just said sorry im nearly finished why dont you hang up a few bags while youre waiting that look on her face said it all
my wife and i live in a suburb where you can park on the street in front of your house directly in front of our home the curb is long enough to comfortably park cars if you pull all the way up to the end my wife parks in our driveway and i park on the curb leaving room for anyone else who needs a spot a couple months ago we got new neighbors who consistently park on the curb right in the middle in front of our housewhich effectively takes up both spots they continued to take up both spaces even after talking to them and politely asking them to pull up so everyone could park last weekend i started feeding the birds again and really seeded the berm right by the curb the next morning their car was covered in birdshit they havent parked there since petty but worth it pic in comments

this story dates from last june i was headed to san diego for a conference the night before i went out for some drinks with a coworker who would also be there a few drinks turned into us pretty much closing down the bar when i woke up at later that morning i actually felt great i figured i must have drunk my way through the hangover this was of course a very stupid thought and as the morning dragged on through getting to the airport getting through security and waiting at the gate my head decided i am an idiot and deserve to be punished it was not wrong i made my way through the plane to my row where i was to be seated in the window a personal preference as i approached my row i saw a woman sitting in the middle seat with her belongings on my seat i politely said that it was my seat and waited for her to move them she let out an overlylarge sigh then laboriously moved her things onto her lap she then sat there and sat i asked her if she would mind letting me by and she said the oddest thing go over me now at first i assumed that this was my fault i assumed that in my awful terrible hangover i had forgotten how people board cramped seats and that i was wrong for assuming she would and should get up to let me in but then i remembered im an idiot so i assumed she had some sort of physical disability which made standing and sitting difficult or painful for her and rather than embarrass her i did as she requested i went over her shortly before takeoff she stood up and hollered at her husband who was in the back of the plane with their two children i dont know why you couldnt get us seats together honestly this is absurd why didnt you lady i got an idea why i didnt really care about her constantly reshuffling things or her armresthogging it did bum me out when her daughter came up to our row with a cheese and cracker platter and asker her mom if she wanted some and the lady simply said no eventually i was able to fall asleep for those who dont drink there is a phenomenon called the beer shits after a night of heavy drinking you will often have a large amount of gas and other things which go along with it the next day about halfway through out flight i felt this coming on and i decided i had no choice but to go i asked her if i could please get out the gentleman in the aisle seat immediately got out but she again said go over me now by this point i was pretty irritable i had an awful headache my stomach was doing somersaults and i was about to blow an oring and this miserable bitch wanted me to go over her on a moving plane fine i would i swung my right leg over her then put my ass over her face nearly touching a slight tremble in the flight and i released a fullon seemingly never ending fart a cloud of noxious gas which should have had me arrested for war crimes i let the whole thing go afterwards i turned made full eye contact and said sorry turbulence everyone around me was fully and truly disgusted and to them i am still so sorry but i did what i did for the greater good when i got back from the bathroom she got up to let me in
every time my brother visits i notice things missing it used to be small things he probably figured i wouldnt miss like snacks and silverware and over the counter pills like aspirin and tums but lately it has been escalating so basically what i did is i have broken gps and mp player that look brand new i put them in a drawer next to the chair he usually sits in and sure enough after he left i checked and they were both gone i immediately called the local pawn shop to report that the items were both stolen and not working got a call a few hours later from the pawn shop confirming that he indeed tried to turn them in and is now banned from the only pawn shop in a mile radius of this town no more selling stolen goods for him at least not to the pawn shop

another restaurant post reminded me of this story you know the scam whine about perfectly good food to get some sort of comp in their old age my parents befriended another older couple who would pull this stunt everywhere they went after my mother told me a few stories about how their new friends had shown them how to get discounted or free meals i felt like i was suddenly the responsible adult concerned about the bad influence these people were on my parents while visiting my parents with my girlfriend this other couple attended dinner with us as i expected the food was brought to the table and they immediately began dramatically complaining to one another about the qualitytastetemperatureetc they were making a scene in order to attract the attention of the waitress when our waitress returned to ask how we were doing the miserable old bastard who played the lead role in their act took a deep breathe struck a dramatic pose with his hand raised to begin gesticulating for emphasis and begai leaned forward and cut him off before he could finish the first word everything is absolutely fantastic its all great thank you very much she smiled and began her obligatory great well if you need any when he made a second attempt we come here all the time an i didnt acknowledge that he was speaking at all repeated that all was just as we ordered and thank her again he was stunned and thrown off from his routine by my interruption during this pause the waitress walked away it seemed clear that she knew what they were trying to accomplish he turned bright red i turned to my girlfriend and smiling and without lowering my voice stated how pitiful it is that some people could be dishonest deceitful and put at risk the livelihood of a cook server or hostess for a pathetic discount or a free earlybird special my passiveaggressive reverseparenting broke my parents of the habit in short time
i was just getting to the bus stop for my morning commute and about to sit on the bench when some guy comes and takes the place instead i was a little annoyed but just stood next to the bench and waited for the bus now the street runs east to west so in the morning the sun is shining directly from the east where the bus is also coming from and directly in our faces for some reason i turn to look at the guy who took my place and saw that he was conveniently crouched behind my shadow taking full advantage of my sunless projection fucker so i take one swift step forward acting like im looking out for the bus and let the full glory of the sun pierce his eyes disturbing his concentration on his phone that will teach him that my shadow aint free

i was at this club one night that had two levels one for dancing and one that is a bar type area with some food after hanging out on the first floor all night i decide to go get some food on the second level because by this point im drunk and starving i look on the menu and i am a little surprised that they have sushi and decide that is going to be the solution to my hunger im chatting with my girl waiting for my food to arrive and once it does im super happy and i start chowing down while still chatting away the table we were sitting at was a little small so the server sat the sushi on the table behind me and the area wasnt packed so i thought no big deal so im turning away from my girl to eat and toward her to talk about the fifth turn in as im getting more food there is a super drunk guy eating my fucking sushi now im a little compassionate because i have done stupid drunk things too but im also really pissed that he is eating my food we make eye contact and he knows he is wrong i know he is wrong and i very calmly push the glob of wasabi and ginger that i have barely touched toward him and tell him that if he doesnt eat them in one bite we are going to have a problem he surprisingly does because i guess our drunk brains agreed that would be dispensed justice he eats them both in one bite and proceeds to have somewhat of a rough time with it coughing and eyes watering what could have turned into an incident was handled with a food challenge it felt good
made for my girlfriend she was mean right before so i gave her a tiny with it
i just saw another thread here that reminded me of this story and thought i might as well contribute so a few years ago i was at the vets office waiting to pick up my dog from some routine something or other i was the only person in the waiting room at first but after awhile a mid s woman comes in with a young boy probably or years old for whatever reason in a totally empty waiting room they come and sit very close to me over in the corner in a little alcove or whatever near a table with a bunch of magazines and coloring books on it before anyone says well no shit they came and sat near the coloring books there was more than one table like this in that waiting room ok so the mom is sitting across from me and the kid is next to her and in between us are these magazines and all that and some crayons and just junk on the table well im reading a magazine and the kid picks up a magazine that is obviously not something hes interested in like the economist or something i turn a page in mine he turns one in his i sigh he sighs i move my leg he moves his leg i pick up another magazine he picks up another magazine hes copying me in other words so at first this was vaguely amusing but then the longer it went on the less funny it got obviously im tired of waiting for my dog ready to leave etc and this kid is mimicking everything i do with this shit eating grin on his face like hes got me and theres nothing i can do about it eventually it gets so that hes mocking my eye movements and facial expressions stuff like that i look over at the mom with a look of are you really going to just let your kid do this for min straight to a total stranger kind of in disbelief and shes smiling at him like hes the most amazing kid in the world and clearly encouraging him to mock me some more up until this point not a single word has been spoken between the of us its all nonverbal communication but it was clear to me anyway lol that the kid was a brat i wasnt in the mood and the mom was over indulgent of him and something had to be done to right the balance of the universe by this time it was obvious to the kid i was annoyed and i had been sitting totally still not doing anything for a minute or two while i thought this through so he was afraid his game was over i guess so finally i moved my arm with elaborate nonchalance and he got this huge grin on his face like fuck yeah this guy still hasnt figured out im the king of this waiting room and he mimics my arm movement very obviously so then i reach over and get a coloring book he gets a coloring book i get a crayon he gets a crayon i slowly take the paper wrapper off the crayon he take his wrapper off his crayon he shoots his mom a jubilant glance once in awhile and she beams back at him like hes a good boy and is taking his first crap in the adult toilet or something so im sitting there with this crayon and hes sitting there with his waiting to mock me more and the mom is looking on waiting to see how special and brilliant her child is going to be and then i stick the crayon in my mouth and start chewing only not really i palmed it and was making these exaggerated chewing motions with my jaw like omg this crayon is so good with this look on my face like i was loving it so then boy wonder stuffs his crayon in his mouth for real and starts going to town on it bits of wax all in his teeth and shit it was glorious finally mom springs into action and snatches him up by one arm and starts smacking his ass with the other hand clearly furious while staring at me the whole time like she wishes she was hitting me i stare back with the shiteating grin i just learned from her year old then after about smacks she grabs the crying child and storms out of the vets office in a huff i have no idea what they were even there for since they left without getting it but i like to think that they went home with a little lesson in waiting room etiquette and i left with my very petty revenge and my loyal dog
well more specifically he was forced to find a new place after the lease ended because he wasnt paying attention this was a number of years ago just after college id rented a two bedroom apartment with a friend of a friend type since we were both staying in the same town after college i planned it to only be temporary and this was the case has things gone amicably id never have done what i did the guy however turned out to be a roommate from hell he was always late in getting his share of the rent and utilities to me sometimes as much as two weeks after constant badgering all of the utilities were in my name and i didnt want my credit score to get fucked up for nonpayment he never cleaned in any way the bastard never took out the trash or recycling he only did his dishes when absolutely pressed could never be bothered to even touch the vacuum and so on i had conversations with him about sharing the workload and was dismissed the asshole would even leave cookware with food in it after using it i didnt want the place adrian monk levels of clean at the very least i wanted women wont vomit in disgust and then run in horror nope this jackass was having none of that he also would blast the tv or music at all hours even am i was counting down the days until the end of the lease when the lease renewal came my idea for revenge sprung into my mind when he was distracted by a particularly intenseclose baseball game i got him to sign it i just said hey man the lease renewal came you need to sign this he signed without looking at it at all and said now fuck off im watching the game well he probably should have checked the document he signed since i had marked the box stating that we would not be renewing the lease and would be out at the end of the month i mailed it in immediately i already had plans to move out of state and had pretty much locked down lodging in my new area over the course of the month i slowly moved everything of mine out of the apartment into a storage unit the lease ended on sunday evening and he worked weekends and then went out to the bar right after work so on friday the th i rented a bigass uhaul loaded much of the storage unit stuff and parked it somewhere safe on saturday the th i got some help to move the rest of everything that i owned outright furniture the living room tv and every last goddamn thing in the kitchen i had the truck loaded and i hit the road headed several states away the fucker came home to an empty apartment and a photocopy of the agreement that wed be out by pm on the st of the month oh id also cancelled all of the utilities since they were in my name effective the st edit since some folks are concerned that i made him homeless he wasnt really he ended up couchsurfing for a couple months before renting with someone else i later learned that he wasnt any better a roommate for them that he had been for me

im in graduate school and my paying job is as a behavioral therapist for a few families that have kids with autism i often take my clients out to the local mall or whatever to engage them with the community one of my clients sean has been diagnosed with both autism and a rare chromosomal abnormality hes nonverbal and has severe physical and mental handicaps but the dude is seriously one of the coolest people ever hes obsessed with one of the department stores in the mall that employs pianists ive spent hours sitting by the piano and listening to them play which is fine because its easy money for me and its probably his most favorite thing ever to do the other week we were in there hanging out sean is standing up and rocking back and forth on his feet clapping and squealing to himself at times he may have been a little louder than the average customer but it was a busy thursday afternoon and he wasnt being disruptive in any way lo and behold a random woman comes up behind me and taps me forcefully on my shoulder she tells me that sean is being way too loud for which i immediately politely apologize for she continues to say that people like sean shouldnt be out in public and i should be ashamed to have a child like that a few minutes later the woman returns with her children and strikes up a short conversation with the pianist most of the pianists are elderly women that are just there to get out of the house and since sean and i are there all the bloody time i know them all by name and they often sit down with us during their breaks for small talk the woman asks the pianist if some of her brood could play on the piano as her oldest is just the talk of her art school and is incredibly brilliant at the piano for her age level the pianist looked her dead in the eye and said im sorry but we try not to encourage rude behavior in our stores perhaps children as brilliant as yours shouldnt be out in public as the woman stood there stunned the pianist turned to sean and gave him a high five

quick revenge story from last weekend my roommate and i have been friends since high school ten years ago lived together for the last three for the most part things have been great we get along well and both of us are easy going to not sweat any minor things lately though shes gotten very careless ive gradually had to take over doing almost all the cleaning dishes etc plus i dont think shes bought groceries once over the last three or four months my first petty revenge was to stop buying groceries myself letting the fridge gradually empty as we ate through things ive seen her come in open the fridge and get frustrated when theres nothing there but it gets better on sunday when there was nothing left besides milk i ordered a pizza before she came home i ate all i wanted and then gave the last couple slices away to a nice homeless man whos often outside our building then i brought the empty box up to our apartment and left the empty box on the stove she came home shortly thereafter to the room smelling like pizza with an inviting box sitting in the kitchen opened it and found two leftover crusts take that

apple stores arent your typical retail store we have revered customer service but sometimes customers have unreasonable expectations why should i have to pay to get my screen fixedapple made the glass too thin and arent happy with our service so they either call applecare or write to the bbb where executive relations will then give them basically anything they want recently a customer came in wanting to get the screen replaced on his iphone s the catch to screen replacements is that a new screen will be shaped like a new phone meaning if the phone enclosure itself got dented a new screen wont fit in properly and we have to replace the entire phone for a much higher cost were not rated on service revenue so we have no motivation to lie to youbut this customer didnt believe that i inform him that two sizable dents on the side of the phone will make it impossible for a new screen to go on so well have to replace the whole device he goes into a frustrated tirade about how we should at least try a screen but if it fails youve wasted and that he shouldnt have to pay if it fails if we waste a part and labor on you after informing you this wont work yes you should he asks for my manager who is months pregnant she calmly corroborates my statement that the repair wont be possible with the dents and that his only option would be a full device swap he retaliates youve got to be the worst bitch ive ever met both of us were being rather nice and empathetic about it she scowls and says im going to have to ask you to leave the store to which he responds why dont you go lose some weight fatty so i decide to write up nonrepair notes on his account about that appointment i saved onto his profile notes that stated our interaction and how he responded how he called my pregnant manager a bitch and told her to lose weight i implored executive relations to not throw us under the bus and to refuse this customer anything besides the originally quoted service sure enough days later i checked his profile again out of curiosity he had contacted a tier applecare supervisor and the notes merely stated read notes from technician at apple retail store informed customer his business would be more welcomed at samsung manager and i fistbumped

earlier last week i called in a prescription refill to the pharmacy at the walmart ive used for the past several years yesterday i got off work scramble and made the minute drive to get there before they close and squeaked in just under the wire with minutes to spare only to be told by the clerk behind the counter were closed i explained i drove like a batoutahell to get there and i really needed my medicine and that it would be another week before i could get back she gave a smirk shook her head no and pointed at the pharmacist who didnt look too concerned either i turned and asked him if i could have my pills he wouldnt even make eye contact and said come back tomorrow being persistent i said fine just give me the prescription the doctor gave me and ill go to competitor and have it filled what i didnt know is that evidently he has to do that if i ask and he suddenly had a change of heart and offered to give me my pills which were already bagged up and ready to go im pissed its saturday night i have nothing pressing and im about to make a point i insisted on the prescription and refused the pills this took him an extra minutes and i waited right there at the counter glaring at him and the clerk who also had to wait with him the entire time he dug for it 
i was and in my first managerial job ie swing shift manager at a fast food burger joint like every place we had a couple of usuals who were assholes for the sake of being assholes one of them an overthetop egregiously aggressive woman who found fault with everything would go ballistic if you so much as failed to address her as maam in every sentence things came to a head when she was so rude to one of our counter clerks that she made the girl cry i told the girl to go back to the break room and take a breather and then calmly informed the woman that she was no longer welcome in our store that triggered the nuclear option i waited for the screaming and cursing to stop waved her to the door and then watched as she left i sent corporate her cc number and license plate info and they sent her a youre banned from all the stores letter filed it with the local pd and told us to call the cops immediately if she ever showed up in our store again which she did a few weeks later she showed up ready to launch into another tirade for whatever imagined offense might occur we politely kicked her out despite her screaming that the donottrespass order was fake wasnt legal didnt apply to her her lawyer said it happened again a couple of times but eventually her luck broke and there happened to be two cops on their dinner break in the restaurant i was on shift that night and i can tell you that i have rarely been so satisfied as when i showed the officers the order identified the woman as the person referred to in it told them about the frequent return visits and then watched them arrest her on the spot best of all i never had to testify she went totally ballistic and scratched a cops face no need to book her for trespassing when resisting arrest and cop assault were so convenient now the vast majority of this story is instant karma so why am i posting in rpettyrevenge the answer is simple after they hauled her away i noticed that her car was still in our lot oh yissss that call to the towing company was the most satisfying two minutes of my young life sure i could have just let it sit there until she came back for it but make my register clerk cry yeah enjoy your trip to the impound lot maam tldr rude customer got banned refused to stop returning got arrested for some instant karma then i pettyrevenged her ass by having her car towed edit to answer some questions how is the clerk doing she was fine by the next day no lasting issues that i noticed did you stay in management no i quit in my freshman year of college im more of a techhead these days so i leave the management up to other people why did you send the cc to corporate wouldnt that be mishandling of the information to send it unsecured via email to a corporate office when my franchise owner and i called the corporate offices to report the incident they asked for the entire receipt history for that visit including the credit card i dont think we actually sent it to them they probably just pulled it from their computers or something so you were her manager you dated a while didnt mention to her that the crazy bitch that made her cry got arrested and towed to clarify yes we discussed it nb the original question was did the clerk get to witness the call so my answer that i was sure she was aware of it didnt specify how ever find out what happened to her in court no all i got was a call from the arresting officer stating that i would not need to give a statement other than what i had told him at the time 
this happened many years ago at the time i was working at a popular tourist attraction that had a hall that could be rented afterhours for events and functions the hall could be accessed in a number of ways including a doorway that opened out onto the street during functions we would often use this doorway to let smokers in and out of the building the only rule was that they had to leave their drinks on a table near the door since liquor wasnt allowed on the street one night we were holding a holiday party for a large bank for whatever reason a number employees of this bank thought they could take their drinks out with them when they were having a smoke this is not legal in our city i was posted near the door to make sure they didnt do this because if they were spotted by police or we were subjected to a random liquor inspection it happens we could lose our liquor license one employee was particularly douchey about not following this rule in fact lets call him db the very first time he attempted to bring his drink out with him i stopped him and let him know the rule he looked me square in the eye and said what a terrible shame it is that i cant enjoy my scotch with a cigarette i looked him square in the eye back and replied yes sir the world is in mourning now please leave your drink on the table if youre planning to go outside from then on db didnt like me for the rest of the night he would attempt to hide his drink under his coat get his friends to distract me or sneak in and take his drink outside when i wasnt looking every time he did this i would quietly approach him and ask that he please take his drink back inside and leave it on the table every time he would openly mock and insult me in front of the entire group of smokers the last straw happened when he got a number of his friends to walk out the door en masse with their drinks as some sort of first world problem protest this time after herding them all back inside i radioed our buildings maintenance worker and asked him to lock the door no more smoking area db and his friends howls of protest attracted the attention of their boss who had planned and was paying for the event he asked me what the problem was and then proceeded to tell off db and his friends for acting like a bunch of immature dickwads he then asked me what he could do to fix this so that the smoking area could be reopened i pointed right at db and said i want him gone the boss nodded and told db to get his jacket and go home i made sure to be at the coatcheck when he left i handed him his jacket and said have a nice night sir best feeling ever
i used to work retail at a thrift store in a really nice neighborhood our customer demographic was almost entirely made up of middle aged empty nester house wives with too much money and too much time on their hands theyd come in daily and treat the store and its staff with such disrespect youd think we had wronged them in some horrible way but there was no better feeling than finishing ringing up a bitter and mean woman who has desperately tried to hide the fact shes ageing behind layers of makeup botox and other various cosmetic miracles looking her dead in the eye and offering her a senior discount nothing wipes a condescending smile off a face faster 
background i work at my city halls switchboard calls range from your standard hello ext please to nonsensical screaming about fluoride i wish i was kidding today i had this lady call or times over the course of about minutes looking to be transferred to our daycare subsidy office the next time she calls she says to me that she wants daycare subsidy but i do not want voicemail i explain to her that unfortunately there is only one extension available for their main reception and if staff is unavailable their voicemail will pick up she very rudely asks if she failed to make herself clear and says again she doesnt want voicemail i explain again that there is only one line to transfer to and that i can not force them to answer we go around in circles like this for a few minutes until she decides to threaten me with do i need to talk to the mayors office about this i told her that it was up to her and i would transfer her if she would like she decided the mayors office was necessary so i transferred herstraight to their voicemail 
so i work tech support for a very large tech company and i help provide support for desktop and laptop computers that my company makes guy calls in he is having a hard time troubleshooting his mail application its receiving mail but isnt able to send mail this is a pretty common call sometimes our mail program likes to delete the smtp password line if anything else changes to help prevent any kind of fraudulentspam emails from being sent by your computer i assure him ill be taking care of this problem the best i can and i start to ask a few probing questions when he stops me and asks to speak to a senior advisor me i know what the source of the problem is most likely and should have this solved in minutes may i ask why you want to speak to a senior advisor customer this is nothing personal but i just dont feel that a woman will be able to fix my email problem me i assure you that i already likely know what the problem is how to solve it and it will be quicker than holding minutes for a senior advisor my gender does not prevent me from helping you with your email customer just get me to a senior advisor i am not going to let you help me so i asked him to hold for a few while i get in contact with a senior advisor i called one up and he was male explained the situation and got off the phone called a second time got another male explained the situation and got off the phone called a third time got a female senior advisor explained the situation she was delighted to take the call changing names due to confidentiality i merged the calls me hello ron are you still there ron yes me thanks for holding ive got a senior advisor on the line per your request her name is katrina ive caught her up to speed as to the problem with your mail program and she will be further assisting you from here sorry sexist pig you arent getting your way you will realize that women have brains too just because my skin is softer and my chest sticks out further than yours does not mean i dont know how to direct you to fill in the password slot in your smtp mail settings jerk gt edit because it may have been unclear i called three times trying to get a female advisor its not that the other male reps were refusing to take the call
a few months ago i was waiting in line at the checkout counter and little did i know i was behind that lady i patiently waited for her basket full of groceries to be scanned while she gave the high school aged clerk a miserable hell i really felt sorry for the young lady who was doing her best to appease this wretched hag when she couldnt provoke a single rude response from her she turned to me arms crossed and said something to the effect of i guess theyll hire anybody to work here oh you spoke to me i guess you are expecting a reply i nicely asked have you been a bitch all of your life or is today special that shut her up and she didnt say another word and i did notice the corner of the clerks mouth turn up slightly when i said it after she was gone and it was my turn the young lady gave me a heartfelt thank you

so i live in a low income housing area of the town i attend college in i was initially drawn to the apartment im currently living in because it was extremely cheap and on the second floor this is a house converted into two living units i immediately signed the lease and everything was dandy for the first few weeks however i had taken notice of the neighborhood riff raff and was wary to keep my distance i wasnt exactly scared of a bunch of young teens but after observing their absolutely appalling nature i tried to give them no excuse to fuck with me through vandalizing my car or apartment well not so long ago i was sitting on my second story porch enjoying a cigarette after a long tedious shift when the teens decided to fuck with me at first i didnt realize they were speaking to me until one of them called out hey you indian fag now even though im not indian people often assume i am because of my skin tone so im aware theyre attempting to heckle me i look up and merely raise my eyebrows in acknowledgment when one of them kicks over my full garbage cans and tells me to get on my knees and pick up my trash you insert random racist slurs here they laugh and leave knowing that ill be fined by the city if i dont clean up the mess i begrudgingly clean up the mess it was while i was kneeling among the strewn garbage that my revenge came to fruition a few nights later i was sitting on my porch again waiting for my targets to arrive sure enough the pack of them comes strutting down the road talking shit and fucking things up when they get to my house i shout at them to keep it down and that theyre being obnoxious just as i had planned they took my bait and the one who had kicked over my trash cans a few days earlier told me that i was a fag and aimed a full forced kick at my trash cans little did he know that i had filled them to the bursting point with packed down rocks and dirt making them extremely heavy and almost unmovable i savored the moments leading up to contact and burst out laughing when the garbage can failed to move and the kid howled out in pain when his foot connected judging from the time he spent on the ground clutching his foot and the fact that he limped away on the verge of tears im assuming he broke a toe or two i slept like a fucking king that night 
this is one of my best im at a christening for one of my nephews and its reception is taking place at a hotel my inlaws booked we get there and there happens to be some other event going on for an orthodox jewish family trouble starts as soon as we pull into the parking lot with three or yearold kids running around the parking lot while im trying to park without running them over no adults anywhere to be seen we get in the hotel and its bedlam in the lobby kids running around the hotel with adults standing around generally not giving a fuck that other people may be utilizing the hotel too so we get to our events room and some kids from the other event open the door and come in to ours they see our kids playing with a bunch of toys and hoola hoops my inlaws brought and want to join in the hotel staff quickly remove them and tried to lock the doors but these kids about different ones keep coming in i go back into the lobby to try to find the parents nothing but bedlam in stark contrast to the control we had over our kids and my own and year olds so as a parent and a jewish person myself i felt it was time to teach the parents of the orthodox jewish kids the dangers of leaving their kids unsupervised the next time their kids came in to our party i handed each one of them a strip of bacon and told them to bring it to their mom they never came back edit for clarity and thanks for the gold i put it with my secret jew 
i have a minifridge in my cubicle this minifridge is used by myself and a few others in the office that im cool with one morning i came in to find there were a weeks worth of salads in my fridge i had no idea where they came from the coworkers who usually use my minifridge told me the salads werent theirs turns out one of the temps got the idea to start putting her food in my minifridge without my permission if she wouldve asked me i probably wouldve said yes and i wouldnt be sitting here on my break typing this out but its too late for that now so without even telling her anything i turned the temperature of my minifridge as low as itll go by the time lunch time rolled around her salads were practically frozen she openly complained to me about the temperature in my minifridge and how she had to wait for the dressing to thaw before she was able to eat it i told her that if she wouldve asked me before she used it that i wouldve warned her that we kept the fridge extra cold you can rest easy knowing that shes using the fridge in the break room now where the rest of the office can steal her food edit i now realize that i should have titled this post petty revenge is a dish best served cold reddit i have failed you

i work at a small store that sells a variety of different things we had a lady come in and after browsing for a few minutes wanted to see one of our products out of the box so she grabs one off the shelf and opens it and in the process rips the packaging i walk over and attempt to explain it to her but i get shooed me away then apparently satisfied she takes a new box off the shelf and walks around a bit i walk over and repackage the one she opened using a bit of tape to seal the ripped sections when she went to pay i swapped the new box for the ripped box she thankfully left unawares fuck those people 
years ago i drove a school bus in my old district when we parked at a school it was policy to park with our front bumper only a couple of inches from the bus in front of us to keep kids from blindly darting between the buses into traffic the bus zones were granted enough space to get the required number of buses that serviced the school and if a bus didnt fit in the zone policy stated that the driver had to find a spot usually a block or two from the school and wait until enough room has cleared up in the loading zone occasionally we would get parents parking in our zone but most times a quick chat with the parent or an address over the school pa system would get the car moved and all of our buses into their spots except for this one parent every day she would show up and park underneath the school bus loading only sign and disappear into the school the one time i tried to talk to her she called my supervisor with claims that i verbally harassed her i dont know about modern school bus recording equipment but the system our district had at the time recorded any audio in range of about feet of the open door i was told that if she parks in the loading zone again i was to call our radio dispatcher who would send out a roving campus security guard who would ticket the driver for parking in a no parking zone the one time that the security guard made it with enough time to catch her in our zone he let her go with a warning a week had passed since the guard incident and as i approached the school i saw the first four buses lined up bumper to bumper and directly behind them was the parent i was bus number five of nine that serviced the school the last bus was going to run late because he wouldnt be able to fit into the loading zone but this time the parent had made a mistake she hadnt left enough room to pull her car out from between the buses so i did was i was supposed to do pull up as close as possible to the bumper of the vehicle in front of me she loaded her kid into the car and realized that she wasnt able to get out from between the buses without one of us moving she went to the bus in front of her and he pointed out that he was just as stuck and couldnt move the bus until departure time she then tried to get me to back up to let her out because i didnt need to park so close to her i told her that she didnt need to park in a bus loading zone after a few hollow law suit threats she finally retreated to her car and had to wait an extra twenty or so minutes until we all departed i didnt see her in the loading zone again for the rest of the school year
so there i was getting my normal hamburger and fries in the cafe at work tonight i brought my meal to the cashier to pay and the conversation with her went like this me hi i have a hamburger without cheese and fries cashier without cheese me correct no cheese cashier ok i gave her my credit card and then noticed she put it into the register as a god damn cheeseburger so i told her me i ordered a hamburger not a cheeseburger you put it in wrong cashier its only a quarter the bitch gave me this look like come on man you can afford it then billed it to my credit card without fixing her mistake i dont care if its a quarter or a fat stack of franklins she stole from me so i grabbed her tip jar and took a quarter out of it she gave me this stunned look like i was violating her tip jar like i was stealing from her like she didnt deserve it i then said its only a quarter shrugged and walked away i made an enemy today
a kid at my college after they passed the smoking ban would smoke in the doorway of the dorm and stink up the lobby he would also leave his butts everywherewe sent him several notices and several times ras had written him up but the administration wouldnt do more than that i even asked him polietly and he gave me a go fuck yourself ill smoke where i want my window was right above the door and his smoke would come in my window andor ac unit i took latex gloves from the lab and i would pick the butts up and put them in a pickle jar once the jar was full i poured the stale nasty cigarette butts in his ground floor window right before an inspection he didnt have a roomate because nobody wanted to live with him since he stank so bad i made it look like he chain smoked in his room at the window which im sure he did anyway the adminstration levied him a fine he smoked in the approved section after that which had a smokers friend butt catcher and was far away from the door to the dorm
so a friend of mine well call him daniel is deaf and has been his whole life daniel was fired from his job by a manager that openly mocked him for being deaf so when he needed to go to the unemployment office he asked me to go with him because i have been trying to learn sign language and we can communicate pretty well we get there and theres only us and a very elderly old man em sitting in the waiting area all of the chairs are set up so that we are facing the only receptionist in the room there seems to be some sort of issue with ems paperwork so every few minutes em would walk up to answer a question of the receptionists or to sign what she asked him to sign and then he would sit back down daniel being the sweet guy he is would reach forward and hold the mans chair every time he went to sit back down so me and daniel are signing back and forth just shooting the shit when a few other people come in including a very loud obnoxious white trash couple now as i previously stated i am just learning sign language so i was concentrating on what i was signing and understanding what daniel was signing so at first i didnt notice white trash couple plop down in the seats behind us then i heard it derrr derrr im a deafiederr i glance behind me without moving my head and in my peripheral vision i can see white trash male mocking daniel and imitating the noises that daniel makes when he laughs or gets into a story white trash bitch apparently thinks this is hilarious i realize that because i am super concentrating i havent said anything or given them any idea that i am not deaf i take a look at the receptionist who looks mortified but seems not to know what to do now nothing would have made me happier than to cause a huge scene but i knew daniel was already self conscious about getting fired so i did the next best thing i waited until em went to sit down again daniel reached forward to hold his chair i spun around in my chair looked white trashy amp and yelled as loud as i could what the fuck is your problem white trash douches jaw drops in shock and the bitch went white as a sheet i just stared at them daniel suddenly realizes i am looking at the white trash couple and signs whats wrong i told him they kicked my chair he signs asshole and glares at them i guess they felt uncomfortable enough that they decided to slink out of the building fuck you and your unemployment check edit concerning the amount of posts regarding legal action against daniels workplace at the time daniel couldnt prove that he had been fired for his disability the manager claimed it was for him being lazy and tried to say that daniel had drawn a penis on the white board in the back that he sometimes used to communicate which he hadnt so daniel went for unemployment while his friends back at his job pulled some strings i want to get daniel to post his revenge story for getting his job back bc i dont think i could do it justice its pretty great thanks for the great responses edit omigosh reddit gold thank you so much 
walking up to the big glass entrance i passed a small group of three or four young boys probably around the age of you could clearly make out the type from afar loud attention deprived the kind its best to not even look at if you dont want to give them a chance to talk shit well sadly i didnt need to as the alpha kid had planned to impress his fellow morons by loudly yelling at a stranger when i ignored his first attempt of making contact he had found reason enough to move on to even cooler stuff namely fearlessly insulting a random and obviously stronger male from ft away at this point i was considering walking right up to them and give them a piece of my mind but decided against after all they would get bored quick if i dont react at all also i was expecting to be inside the school very soon after much to my dismay i found the doors had already been locked shut with only someone from the inside being able to let me in since i didnt have a key and looking through the mostly glass front no one was in sight so i waited having my back towards the kids who had gone on shittalking me loudly as to make sure i wouldnt miss any of their intellectual artistry it became obvious they where also waiting to get inside after about two or three minutes i finally saw someone walk past the door and signaled to him that i wanted to come inside although he didnt seem too pleased with his newfound divine purpose he reluctantly walked over and opened the door i went inside turned around and saw the alpha kid running towards me shouting hey guy hoping to finally get to go inside aswell i looked over to the open door which basically closes in slow motion if left to itself smiled at the boy grabbed the handle and shut it keeping that big smile on my face i headed towards my destination now accompanied by the beautiful sound of muffled curses from a boy who had it coming

i walked into a starbucks today im a long way from home already checked out of my hotel and needed a place to unwind and catch up on email and reddit of course the one open seat was next to a man who was reading this was not a shared couch these were two separate seats with an end table in between them i quietly sat down and opened my computer the reading man gave me an incredibly dirty look and let out a loud how dare you type sigh for the next ten minutes i made no noise or significant movement other than some light key tapping yet he continued to audibly be annoyed at me even going so far as to mutter come on in my direction when i shifted my weight finally when the two girls across from us left he loudly and purposefully gathered up his belongings and went over to one of the now empty chairs in a huff a few minutes later he got up to go to the bathroom reserving his seat with his book just then a woman with a toddler approached me and asked if the seat next to me was taken sorry im waiting for my wife i lied but one of the seats across from me is open the reading man returned from the bathroom to find the seat next to him loudly occupied by a woman with a toddler on her lap watching a cartoon on an ipad with no headphones tldr starbucks is not your living room people can sit wherever they please and ive never met someone who i cant outasshole
a few weeks ago i started receiving calls about a medical bill i told the lady known henceforth as jane that i had already paid it via online banking the week prior she said it probably hadnt processed and hung up jane continued calling daily however i again told her it had been paid the nd and rd time she calledsame lady btw the th time i requested an email address to send her proof that it was paid she gave me a fax number a fucking fax number we dont have a fax machine at my work because ya know its not anymore i insisted on an email address and she finally gave me one i sent them a pdf of my health savings account statement after i cropped out all the account numbers this should have taken care if it right wrong jane called the next day and now needs a copy of the check from my hsa bank getting pretty pissed at this point i am overloaded at work as it is and they are interrupting my day because of their shitty system whatever i just need to end this i called my bank and requested a copy of the check they sent one days later i forwarded this check image to the same email address they originally provided in the email i stated that i would like a confirmation reply that shows jane a received this email and b will be removing me from the call list i got zero replies so every day for the last days i have been calling the billing department and specifically asking for jane enjoy my incessant phone calls because it is now you that has to provide proof to me whats that no need to call because it should be taken care of nownope i simply must call daily to confirm where i am at in the system to get written approval whats that there is a confirmation in the mail sorry im going to need immediate confirmation that what you are saying is true ill stop calling when i have letter in my hand edit til i am stupid i called jane yet again today requesting a confirmation of payment via email jane was out or busy apparently instead i got someone else who informed me that my payment was still due i almost shit my pants with anger when she said that i had had enough i requested supervisor i start ranting the bill was i set up online payee using information on bill i paid to that payee i sent proof of that payment mark it paid and send me confirmation thats about the point they informed me that i was missing a chromosome apparently there were in fact two bills for that posted within a week of one another from the same doctor one was for my visit to urgent care for a spider bite one was for my daughters visit for temperature of though they should have informed me of bills in their system during the first phone call it is ultimately my fault for identifying my medical bills based on the amount due instead of the date of service amp patient name once i realized what was happening i apologized for everything and said i would get the nd bill paid immediately i then derped my way off of the phone as fast as i could because it was hard to hear with all the shaming going on so now im embarrassed and i have to pay another my conclusion is that similar to spiderman my spider bite gave me special powersmine were just a different kind of special
hello my names rich and im an illustrator in november of last year i started drawing monsters for charity at the time of writing this im about halfway there anyway ive been experimenting with periscope recently drawing live for whoever fancies watching so the other night i thought id draw something on periscope it was all going well a comedian im a big fan of watched for a while things were going great then a pack of trolls arrived the leaders opening gambit was im gonna come yours and stab u mums this was troubling for reasons periscope uses gps to give a fairly accurate location of where i was broadcasting my mum doesnt live with me but i live there and i certainly didnt want to get stabbed and he said mums plural did he know something i didnt did i have more than one mum and was she also in danger after a mercifully brief torrent of poorly spelled abuse and well worn threats they up and left as suddenly as they arrived i should have thought trolls eh whaddya gonna do i should have risen above it all i didnt though and i found it was still playing on my mind the next day i remembered that my troll had rather foolishly used his actual name so i googled him eventually i found him i say eventually but it was actually disturbingly easy to find out vast swathes of information on him by simply googling his admittedly fairly unique name he looked about years old he looked exactly as id imagined it was as if every troll theres ever been had been fed into a supercomputer and this boy was the result i should have laughed it off and thought nothing more of it i didnt i found who i believed to be members of his family its like i always say dont get mad tell their mums and dads i picked out who i gathered were probably his parents i messaged them over facebook telling them what had happened in the most grown up and rational way i could muster i also provided screenshots of the chat log just in case they went on the offensive and accused me of making it all up i read my message over once or twice and pressed send about an hour later i got a message back from his dad which ive posted below it seemed my rational and calm approach had paid off and that his little darling would be in for a right ticking off in the very near future that day that day was a good day and i only had to use my ak times which is a definite improvement its just a shame that i wasnt present to actually witness the almighty bollocking first hand hope alls well rich x some pictures 
they stopped paying me after only dollars while still using the xbox almost all day every day not giving it back so i pretended to put it past me while i patiently waited for an opportunity to get my revenge and it came years later the twinbrothers had this class that assigned a page essay and they didnt want to do it i offered to do it for dollars each they accepted i dont know why they accepted but they did so i told them ill hand it in the morning of the due date except i didnt i spent all weekend playing pc games i bought with the dollars not even thinking about the twins come monday the due date they corner me barking i just smile and ask what games they played this weekend on their newlypurchased xbox they failed the course and had to take summer school in order to graduate high school on time i know this might not seem petty but all i had to do to achieve revenge was ask them a question and collect bucks and nothing else so maybe its more of an elegant revenge 
so today i was on a flight from oakland ca to ontario ca mind you this is not a long flight its usually about minutes so when most people are doing something annoying unacceptable on the flight i can ignore it pretty well due to the short exposure today however i got a chance to pettily punish someone that i could not pass up this grownass man was sitting in the seat behind me and even before we took off he started bumping up against the back of my seat i thought hes a tall guy and must be uncomfortable so ill give him like ten minutes to settle down he did not settle down he constantly kicked the back of my seat for the entire flight i know i should have turned around and told him to knock it off gently of course but part of me was hoping that he would be a decent enough human to realize how horrible he was being im not a confrontational person and ill avoid social interaction with strangers if i can help it so i settled in and gritted my teeth much to my disgust he not only does not stop the kicking he decides its ok to cram his smelly unkempt man foot right up next to me between my arm rest and the wall i was in the window seat at this point i think he must realize what hes doing hes so very clearly violating my personal space i wait patiently to move his foot but of course he just leaves it there so the pilot announces we were making our final descent into ontario and i had just about had it with the smell of this dudes foot and his constant kicking in fact the smell was so bad it was kind of tickling my nose it tickled my nose enough to kind of make me have to sneeze normally i would have not done what happened next because it is uncalled for and wrong but i had been listening to eugene mirman and his sardonic comedy kind of pushed me over the edge to fuck it level i sneezed on this dudes nasty foot i pretended i was covering my nose and mouth with my arm and turning my head away from the passenger to my left even though i apparently sneezed into the crook of my arm in reality i missed it completely and most of my nose juice landed in his flipflop clad foot needless to say he immediately retracted his foot he couldnt say shit to me either he didnt bother to confront me but if he had i would have apologetically said i didnt realize his foot was there between my window and my seat so sorry tldr i sneezed on a mans foot because he invaded my personal bubble on an airplane and would not stop kicking the back of my seat
back in grade school i popped the lock on the bathroom door and took about seconds of super film of my little sister sitting on the toilet i thought it was hilariously funny and it was to teach her a lesson about invasion of privacy shed embarrassed me by snooping through my drawers and sharing personal letters my parents of course werent amused i was grounded and even worse never allowed to use the video camera again my sister out of earshot of our parents gloated over me being the only one to get into trouble and the punishment seem horribly unfair at the time because no one ever saw the footage keep in mind this was back in the mids when there was no instant playback you had to mail the film off and wait a few weeks for it to return my parents asked the film developers to remove the last seconds of the film when it was processed or so they said fast forward years my parents recently gave me all the old mm family films so i thought id surprise them by having all the reels converted to dvd for christmas and guess what i found at the tail end of one of those reels yep the infamous deleted toilet scene heres my petty revenge i got in trouble for something no one ever saw before so now decades later heres a tastefully edited screen that literally dozens of people might see tldr the only thing worse than a nosy little sister is petty older sister with a grudge edit with update jan i showed this to my sister keep in mind were both in our s now right before christmas not having any idea how shed react to it i honestly thought only a handful of people might see it maybe a few hundred if i was really lucky but as of today its had views she absolutely loved it read every single comment and laughed her ass off but i know her yr old self would have cried in abject humiliation and yr old me would have been overjoyed at the epic revenge of having tens of thousands of strangers around the world see her on the toilet showing this to her before christmas was a mistake though especially with our parents in the room she blurted out oh my god you converted all those tapes for us for christmas completely ruined the surprise guess i need to start plotting my next petty revenge for 
my apartment has very limited parking with only three guest stalls that the other residents have to use if they own more than one car if you cant find a spot you have to park across the street a good feet away its a pain but generally the neighbors try to keep their cars in the guest stalls moving from day to day so they arent hogging them except this one guy he lives alone gives everyone the stink eye if you wave hello and just comes off like an asshole well he owns two vehicles one car and one s pickup that isnt suped up or anything its just a normal truck with a faded factory paint job this prick parks in the stall so it goes over the line and crowds out anyone trying to park next to it hes got a super sensitive alarm that sets off a little warning beep if you fart to close to it and then you can see him yank the blinds down from his window and look out at you if he hears it so heres the part that makes him a total shitfuck if he leaves for a weekend he takes the truck so he moves his car into the guest stall leaves his covered stall empty and takes off fuck you so one day i happen to come home while hes doing the ol switcharoo and his guest stall is empty because hes in the truck while his car is double parked in the street quick as i can i drive into the lot and jump into the guest spot i get out of my car and look over to see him standing by his car which he was about to put where i am hes giving me a death glare then drops down into his car tears off with a chirp of his tires and parks it waaaaay across the street and has to walk back at this point im in my own apartment and i hear his door slam and his truck leaves i give it an hour and then move my car into my designated covered stall by the time he returns sunday afternoon someone else has his spot so he still cant park there its been weeks and he still hasnt gotten the guest stall back mmhmmm
i buy my husband poptarts two boxes at a time and he freaking loves them i occasionally like a breakfast pastry treat as well but my husband is a poptart vacuum or something because every time i go to find myself one theyre always all gone i decided to buy my own box along with the two i regularly buy for my husband i am not quite the black hole for poptarts as my husband is so my one box lasted about two and a half weeks before he found them where i had been hiding them in the cabinet where i keep my casserole dishes his were long gone you see there were two packages left and they were gone in seconds okay a day or two but still they were the smores kind too my absolute favorite the next time i went grocery shopping i got him his boxes of poptarts but i got him the unfrosted kind the unfrosted kind unfrosted enjoy your roof shingles lover lt
a couple of years back myself and a couple of friends were enjoying some late night weekend drinking as usual the bar was packed and i was still waiting for drinks after minutes or so i am not a patient person i saw many people come and go from the bar yet i was still to be served when i finally secured a place at the bar about to hail the bar steward only to notice a sharp digging pain in my left side i look a young girl around yo was stood there i heard her friend tell her to dig her elbows deeper then she somehow managed to get in front of me to the bar block my path and allow her pal access i had waited too long for this to happen and not yet being drunk i quickly thought of a plan its ok ladies allow me this rounds on me what would you like they requested their order though i never bothered to listen to it they then freed up some space for me to get to the bar i ordered my drink and nothing more i then proceeded to explain to the barman how i had heard these girls talking about school and probably werent old enough for drinking i turned around to see them casting me some really evil looks as i left the bar with only my drink they lost their place had to wait some more time only to be refused drinks as they failed to produce id tldr girl elbows me out of the way in a bar queue i offer to buy drinks and instead buy only my own alert the bartender to possible underage drinking feel like a boss all night
my brother was being mean to me i took one of the rubber stoppers on the bottom of his laptop off and now it wobbles fear me
long time reader first time poster so my fiance and i recently made the big move and got a house we were renting previously now in scotland where we live there is a law that says taking admin fees for a lease is illegal and this was clarified in so a lot of people were writing to their landlordsletting agents requesting that these illegal fees be reimbursed i was one such tenant however as i had paid this in cash and couldnt trace the transaction my letting agents simply responded that they would be happy to refund me but without a receipt or bank transfer number there was nothing they could do no paperwork no money im afraid you could just be claiming against anything otherwise i admitted defeat as it was only and i had already put it aside as a loss when i paid it but i was however annoyed by it so it comes time for us to move out around about the time i took over the lease in when the rental act scotland was clarified they also introduced the deposit protection schemes this meant that your deposit had to be placed with a third party to be protected and then released when both parties agreed to a split of the money for damaged etc my letting agents had already explained that they would be taking a large chunk of my deposit to repair the wear and tear of the carpets as i was arranging the move out and getting the details for the deposit scheme i requested an inventory of the flat to ensure that everything would be returned how it was and try to get as much of my deposit that was remaining after they took their slice for carpet repair they sent me an inventory it did not have my name on it nor the date that i had taken on the lease it was from two years previously and named the girls that i had taken the lease over from in their laziness the letting agents had just transferred the tenancy over to me without doing an inventory check i brought this to their attention and asked them to supply an inventory check with my name and details of the tenancy taken at my time of moving in they were unable to i pointed out that should i challenge their request for carpet repair money out of the deposit that they had no paperwork to back their claim that the carpets were not already worn and damaged before i moved in they tried to brush the matter aside and stated that it was a technicality i wrote several emails explaining that i would be claiming all of my deposit back as the letting agents was not in possession of the correct paperwork to claim anything i won because no paperwork no money im afraid you could just be claiming against anything otherwise i am now awaiting the bank transfer of every penny to appear in my account within the next working days tldr letting agents screwed me on an illegal charge and wouldnt give it back on a technicality i used the same technicality to get all of my deposit back that was more than the initial charge

im a woman whos been at my job for years now and slowly made my way up to thirdincommand our firm was bought out by an elderly gentleman who gave it to his yearold daughter as a birthday present so now everyones jobs depend on the whims of this girl who has no idea how our business is run she is very tempermental and has already fired a dozen employees that have been with us for years or more because she didnt like the way they looked at her in her skintight leather miniskirt or because she wanted their job for one of her friends or they blanched at her idea to spend to replace all the florescent lighting in the building because it makes her look pale hell why not so everyone has been kissing ass but no one quite as heartily as sexist asshole mick whos been at the firm for a whopping months but assures miss boss that hes got years of realworld leadership experience really one year more than me you see because hes wanted my office ever since he was hired and this is his only chance of course he deserves an office for his parttime job where he does nothing but copy numbers but offices are only for management he thinks he can get an office if he gets someone fired and so campaigned miss boss to fire me the only female manager telling her that im lazy that i cant lead a team etc she thinks hes sexy and so has listened with awe to his ramblings meanwhile whenever shes gone mick smirks at me and brags about how hes going to have my office any day now i ignored him at first but then i had a better idea why go for my office its one of the smallest doesnt have a window i would think youd need something bigger if youre going to be the new vicepresident hmm well he was just thinking of being a manager like me but yeah why not be a vicepresident the current vicepresident is another sexist asshole who hired mick and who sheltered him whenever i would complain about his bullshit and backstabbing behavior and while mick is just making up shit about me he actually knows some real dirt on the veep hell why not vicepresident gets the word that mick is gunning for his job mick has been blabbing about all the conferences that veep takes which are really just vacations on the company dime the look on veeps face i tried to warn you dumbass i also helpfully remind mick of my faults like that i never leave the office on time and im always interrupting people at meetings and i sleep at my desk which is covered in papers he agrees those are all terrible things and so he dutifully reports them all to miss boss yesterday miss boss made the announcement that veep has been asked to retire word around the watercooler is that mick is in deep shit too because he not only blabbed to miss boss about veep but to our competitors which made the company look bad she is pissed plus mick didnt just ask for veeps office bigger is better right he asked for the entire conference room to be made his office he even drew a blueprint of how it could be redesigned with its own bathroom and sitting area even bigger than miss bosss office rumor has it miss boss laughed at him and then said are you fucking serious youre fucking having delusions of grandeur kid hes lost all credibility and is back typing numbers at his cubicle and of course now miss boss needs a new vicepresident she told me shes heard that i work long hours i never leave the office on time and that i constantly have new ideas im always interrupting people at meetings and that i dont quit until a project is done i sleep at my desk and that i needed a bigger office she pointed to my desk which is again covered in paperwork she asked me if id take veeps old office and job hell why not tldr asshole protected by asswipe asshole wants my job i convince him to try for asswipes job instead both go down i am the last man standing edit well holy shit this blew up didnt it lemme answer some questions no ive never seen house of cards i am however a game of thrones fan miss bosss father recently passed away that family comes from old money theyre so rich they dont know what to do with themselves buying this smalltomedium sized business wasnt that big a deal to them its only a big deal to the ants below she just got her degree after several years of flunking classes in a major that doesnt have anything to do with the company and took a yearlong vacation to find herself and giving her this tiny company was daddys way of trying to make her grow up she really doesnt want to disappoint his memory and is stepping up her game a bit which is good news for everyone yes she fired a lot of people in her first few weeks here this state has an at will employment policy she didnt tell them why they were being fired but she would usually make an offhand comment like ugh why cant people dress professionally while staring at someone and then that same person would coincidentally be called into her office at the end of the day didnt take long to catch on she has since stopped doing that and ive convinced her to hire some people with pretty impressive resumes im going to stay and see where this thing goes might as well save up this new paycheck while i can and its possible she could learn good management and its an interesting challenge working for a millenium age woman she does have some decent ideas i am updating my resume however sleeping at my desk is what i do instead of going home i live alone sorry if i made it sound like i conk out in the middle of the workday i have a couch in my office havent moved into the new one yet because mb insisted on redecorating it first

i took the family out to eat at applebees the lot was full and i saw a customer come out to leave so i waited for him to pull out and take the spot guy pulls out and a car full of young girls just pull in to my spot you know the type well i rolled down my window and told them i was waiting for that space and the driver says to bad your name wasnt on it i was livid but just waited for another space and went in and ate girls were at the bar doing shots getting wasted we enjoyed our meal and paid the waiter i then asked the waiter if he wanted to make i asked him to go up to the girls min after we left and tell them they got a call from someone that said that they had keyed their car and that they should have parked somewhere else i did not key the car i called him about an hour later to ask how it went he said they all went nuts screaming and shit and even called the police bonus cops came and found no damage to car but noticed the girls were to damaged to drive cops left and circled back and watched the car girls come out get in car start the car and the parking lot explodes in blue light busted duis and pds for all i did not know about the bonus till a week later when i went back for a few beers the waiter recognized me and told me the bonus story laughing the whole time another to the waiter best i ever spent edit there is some confusion about duis and pds for all where i am from the key just has to be in the ignition for a dui the car doesnt even have to be running pdpublic drunkenness cops here have a lot of leeway and only need to detect alcohol on the breath to arrest you on that charge i suspect the girls were all ugly to cops so they got pd only the driver got a dui as for stoping them in the parking lotprivate property rather than wait till they were on the road i would think that that would be a public safety and liability issue would be interesting to hear from a leo about this edit thank you for the gold it is my first and second

not sure if this is allowed sorry if not saw stephen fry live last week and he told us this story just after the first harry potter book had been released he was offered the role of narrating it for audiobooks he hadnt read it and was simply told it was a childrens book so figured it would be an easy afternoons work when he met jk rowling she mentioned that she was writing a sequel stephen replied very condescendingly good for you a few years down the line the books are selling well and he is doing the recording for the prisoner of azkaban when he runs into the phrase harry pocketed it stephen could not say this line it always came out as harry pocketeded it unless he said it ridiculously slowly they tried time and time again to get it right but to no avail eventually he called up jk and asked if he could say harry put it in his pocket instead she thought for a moment then said no and hung up the phrase harry pocketed it appeared in the next four books

i was teaching middle school math upper middle class school of usually super nice kids i also have an uncanny memory random kids in my classes passing in the hallway can walk up and say what did i get on my test and i can usually tell them their exact grade one day i passed back tests in class and a boy who made a came up and said you marked one wrong that was right and sure enough there was the right answer on the paper but i swear i remembered that he had put a different answer and of course i could see that it had been erased and changed but im humani could have made a mistake he could have changed it before he handed it in so i gave him the benefit of the doubt and changed his grade to the next quiz we took same thing he walks up with a saying you counted one wrong that was right now seriously what are the mathematical odds that the exact same thing happened again to the exact same kid and im pretty accurate in my marking i could even see the eraser crumbs on his paper from where he had changed the answer i knew the little cheater was trying to put one over on me again so i said i really dont remember this answer being here when i marked your paper he said i promise ms skizethelimit i really had this answer i said are you sure he put on the sad puppy face and said yes i promise i said well in that case im sure it will be the same on this reaching into desk photocopy i made of your test before i handed them back yes i did photocopy that little sneaks quiz before i handed it back as i compared the two papers the river of tears began as he knew hed been caught not only did he have to keep that i took points back off the previous test too take that sucker and dont pull that crap on me again editjust a little note that teaching philosophygrading has changed pretty radically these days and grades are meant to be a reflection of actual ability in the subject area not a reflection of values or ethics so i really would not be at liberty to give a kid a zero when he made a not saying i agree with thatjust stating the rules that teachers are bound by i didnt say he wasnt punished just not by me i had a conference with his parents and showed them the tests hes really a nice polite never any trouble kind of kidjust a little too driven to perfection i believe they grounded him

on the way home from visiting a friend me and my blind friend had to get on a bus since we both have the right to sit in the priority seats my friend because shes blind and me because i had knee surgery a while back we of course sat in them but mostly since they were the only free seats were we could sit next to each other and chat after a while some bitch got on the bus and immediately tried to force us out of the seats now i kept my crutch between me and my friend so it wasnt visible and you obviously cant see that my friend is blind so the bitch started sceaming at us because she just saw two normal teens hogging the priority seats bitch what the hell are you two sitting here for im pregnant so i have the right to sit here she didnt even show and i looked around to spot another seat right by the exit door in the middle of the bus me my friend and i have the right to sit here and there is still an open seat a bit further back you can sit on bitch i demand to sit here i really hate being ordered around and i would have had absolutely no problem with moving if she had asked politely but since she decided to be an obnoxious bitch from the start and made my friend feel really uncomfortable with the screaming i decided to make her feel most and utterly embarrassed i get out my crutch from between me and my friend and hold it out to her me can you please hold it so i can help my blind friend move and please dont drop it its hard to bend down after my knee surgery the bitch stares at us for a while and since i spoke very loudly many people are now staring at the bitch she then slowly shuffles to the seat in the middle people giving her glares since she tried to force us out of the seats the rest of the ride went on in silence and two nice people helped me and my friend off the bus giving us a nice job before they went back on the bus i waved at the bitch with a smile as the bus left
i was in second grade every morning my dad would give me a blow pop lollipop that i would enjoy at my leisure i usually ate it after school during the bus ride home there was this bully whose name i dont even remember and he would always harass kids and no one ever stood up to him i do remember he was big for a fourth grader and rumor was he was held back a grade i never asked him so i dont know for sure but it was likely since he was a fucking moronasshole one day i was getting my blow pop out of my backpack and he saw me do it he walked up to me and called my attention hey kid i see you with a blow pop every day he said my dad gives me one every day i said admitting to a bully that you have an endless supply of what he wants is a terrible idea but i was young and nave give it to me no he took it from me before saying another word i protested and reached for it and all he did was shove me away and i knew i had lost he unwrapped it while staring straight at me and put the lolly in his mouth like he was trying to seduce my inner rage into a fight i took judo for a year when i was around five or six but i knew that shit wasnt going to save me most of what we did in that judo class was trip other little kids when theyre holding you from a set position and this big little asshole probably wouldnt attack me with a karate chop so i wasnt prepared to trust my martial arts training to prevent me from getting my ass kicked in front of a bus full of peers no instead i just took it the next day i was getting my lollipop out and dickballs mcthief came right up to me and collected it once again unwrapping it in front of me and sticking it in his mouth while maintaining eye contact like hes cesar millan and im a disobedient chihuahua on the third day i decided to eat my lollypop during lunch so i didnt have to give it up to this turd later on thats when i learned what this little prick was made of wheres my blow pop he asked like an asshole i didnt get one today i dont care if you dont get one i want my blow pop every day and you are gonna get it for me i tried to put up a verbal fight but all he did was shove me and press on all i could do was give in and agree to pay him his blow pop tax every day the next day he got his lolly and gave me his stupid patented stare down and the day after that and the time after that i got tired of not having a blow pop so one morning i asked my dad for two and he said no that one was enough i disagreed and told him i needed two because i had to give one to this kid on the bus my dad gave me a speech about bullies and told me i have to resolve that situation because i cant live in fear and all that crap but he also stressed that i shouldnt fight him unless he fights me good because i didnt want to fight him that day before school ended i had a brilliant revenge idea i went to the bathroom unwrapped the blow pop unwrapped my pants and rubbed that candy all over my dick balls and asshole i went to town on that shit i spread my cheeks i stretched my sack against it i even pulled my foreskin back and got my glans all over it by the time i was done i had rubbed it on me so much that if someone sucked my dick theyd promptly be arrested for statutory rape but also they would be like wow your penis tastes like a blow pop i shoddily rewrapped the candy and headed to the bus like clockwork unbeknownst cocksucker demanded the blow pop and i gave it to him he did his usual intimidating unwrapping ritual without relenting in his eye contact with me then he put it in his mouth my laughter was maniacal hes standing there with the lolly in his mouth and im laughing like a bond villain without waiting for him to ask whats so funny i yelled i put that in my butt the kids in the immediate area started laughing at him and i just continued to yell what ive done i rubbed it on my butthole i peed on it that was a lie but the general idea is there kids started mocking him while i kept yelling what i had done in the most delirious tone imaginable and he just threw the blow pop on the ground and started spitting the bus driver got in on this commotion and wanted to know what was wrong and like a little pussy the bully actually told him i got in trouble for it and it escalated to the point where my parents were called to the vice principals office about my behavior nothing happened to the bully as far as im aware but he never ever fucked with me again and i enjoyed my blow pops in peace for another few weeks until i got sick of them
its now a video series lawn justice part three is now part part i think i get it now in shellys world you push a button and money comes out anytime she wanted to party all she had to do was take hours out of her day to mow my lawn stop by my office and she instantly got next day broke mow the lawn again pass go collect another i think she was confused and even hurt when i put a stop to it silas came to my work and threatened me with a bullshit lawsuit but i think he was whiteknighting for shelly they have a kid together so i dont blame him but i could not resist seeing what would happen if i confronted him instead of calling i decided to get up early this morning and go to the law firm where silas had a job the business card he gave me just said the offices of legal guy legal eagle and law dude you can substitute the names of actual attorneys here none of which are silas as soon as i walked in the front door i saw silas sitting at the back of the front room he looked up panicked and i swear to zeus he skulked out of the room like hed shit himself went into an office and closed the door behind him now my brother had already told me that he knew silas worked for a law firm shelly had told him he couldnt remember what silas did there but we reasoned that silas couldnt possibly be a lawyer because he graduated from a year community college just two years ago the timing you see i asked the receptionist who that guy at the back was and she said his name is silas he is one of our best paralegals i asked if that meant he could sue somebody and she laughed yeah thats what i thought i asked if i could talk to him and she said id be better off talking to an attorney and that law dude and legal eagle were in the building no thanks i really need to talk to silas she said is this a personal thing and i said well sorta and she whispered to me look silas has already gotten in trouble once this week for personal stuff can you wait until lunch when hes out of the office uh no he came to my office tried to embarrass me no way in hell im letting him get off that easy if id thought ahead of time i wouldve taken today off i could only wait half an hour for him to come back to his desk yes im a sucker but he stayed put in that closed office and i had to get to work myself i wrote a note for the receptionist to give to silas ill be back at on my lunch break if youre busy or gone im sure one of the attorneys here can help me instead he showed up at my office at he closed my door and sat down and looked like he was about to cry he couldnt even look at me but he mumbled how he was trying to spend more time with his son and he believed some things that werent true and how very sorry he was and how his life was falling apart he said he was trying to get custody of his kid but it was hard to do because he was trying to go back to school which took time and money and was not a woman his words not mine fuuuuuck hell make a good lawyer someday almost made me cry we started talking about the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth i told him how shelly had mowed every few days and i was refusing to pay her for the last day because she didnt do shit except sit in her car for an hour he said that was his fault she had called him while she was waiting for me that day and she was in a panic because she had been seen breaking into my house and she wait what he calmly continued that she said she had broken into my house and that she was all upset because she had taken a laptop what he said calm down she put the laptop back but she was upset because the neighbors had seen her climb through my window and she was worried she was going to get arrested i asked why she didnt just leave that day then he said she was afraid that would make her look guilty oh my god he said that he had told her to wait until i arrived and to explain she told him that she was going to try to get into my house once i got home so that her fingerprints would have a reason to be there well that explains why she was so pushy and insistent on getting inside wait wait how did she put the laptop back she went in through the window twice she said she left the front door open so she could say that you left your door open and that was why your laptop was missing i told her that wasnt a good idea no shit sherlock i really really want to hit this guy but i manage to stay polite and ask him nicely if he would mind telling the police that shelly admitted to him that she went through my window i omit the part about the neighbors saying they didnt want to get involved i think shelly brought her kid to along a few times she mowed and they saw and felt bad for her he says he doesnt want to make an already ugly situation even uglier i remind him that if he wants custody of his son this would be a good start he says ill think about it i resist the urge to get up and dance then this happened a friend of mine that works for the town newspaper gave me this shelly got picked up this afternoon she was speeding and got pulled over couple of things you might notice from that press release shes not being charged with breaking and entering because according to the investigator i talked to earlier if i left my window open she didnt technically break in the cops are claiming that i had complained of a missing laptop the day that i called them no i didnt i didnt notice anything missing that day i wouldnt have known she was even in my house until my neighbors told me they saw her break in im guessing this is to make the cops look less like idiots i love how they called it an investigation like they had actually done their job shelly apparently told the cops that she had temporarily lived at my house my brother used to live with me right after our dad died and he and shelly dated during that time and she slept over more than a few times but she never paid rent or anything its possible she thought she could tell the cops some excuse about how she was my roommate this pisses me off more than anything she did before when she was arrested she gave her moms address as her permanent residence i think she and her son had been staying there since silas kicked her out she made bail immediately i would bet silas paid it out of guilt but i cant be sure i do know that she left her kid at her moms house and that no knows where she is right now i really really hope she doesnt skip town but i wouldnt be surprised guess shell owe silas some money
so this happened a few months ago but i just remembered it would fit in this sub i was talking to a girl for about a month or so we were really starting to click and we hung out two or three times a week about three weeks into our flirtationship she and i were chilling at her house and were really bored i had netflix and she didnt so we turned on her dads xbox and i logged into netflix on it now after about another week or two she decided to call things off and in quite a bitchy manner she stopped talking to me texting me and taking my calls and said she didnt want to date me and that it was my fault to avoid sounding sour about it still ill just say that she wasnt very reasonable so i tried to get over it as soon as possible and went about my business and then it happened i was at home playing call of duty or something i saw her dads username pup up saying he was online her parents were pretty fond of me and her dad added me over the course of those few weeks i went onto my friends list to see if he was getting on a game i had to and i realized it wasnt him netflix popped up on his activity log she was still using my netflix account after completely shutting me out so i did possibly the pettiest thing ive ever done yet it was satisfying to no end i changed my netlfix password
im housesitting at the moment for my cousin he and his boyfriend live in a pretty swanky neighborhood full of mcmansions nothing too fancy just your common uppermiddle class suburban development anyhow over the past few weeks theyve been having a new porch installed on the back of the house the crew has a trailer parked out front so they can lock up their tools at night no big deal right apparently it is this evening i get a knock on the door im always wary of solicitors so i make it a point to look out the window before answering the door after hearing the doorbell it takes me a minute to get to the window as i look outside i see a woman walking away with two little dogs one of the dogs stops and proceeds to shit on my cousins lawn i wait until the dog is done and open the door by this time the woman is beginning to walk away but she sees me and turns around she introduces herself as a board member of the hoa homeowners association she looks very annoyed without taking a breath she launches into a lecture about the trailer parked out front how shes lucky to have walked by and caught this egregious violation of the hoa rules and how the trailer is an eyesore on the neighborhood she says she wont report me to the board and suggest a fine if i remove it immediately i calmly inform her about the patio construction and how the crew needs to store their tools and materials at night but shes absolutely foaming at the mouth about how tacky it is to have a trailer in front of the house and again its against the rules i calmly inform her that i am not the homeowner nor the owner of the trailer and there isnt much i can do about it especially at pm on a friday night nevertheless shes adamant that i do something by this point im fed up with this woman who obviously has nothing better to do with her evening than bother her neighbors with bullshit i look at her and casually ask just out of curiosity whats the fine for not picking up after your dog if it shits in someones lawn i tell ya the look on her face at that point was classic she stuttered for a minute before telling me she would have to look into that i told her id be grateful if she did because my cousin has been suspecting a neighbor of letting their dog poop in his lawn so he set up a video camera in the window to catch the culprit upon hearing that she got a little flustered and told me to tell the patio crew to hurry up then she walked away with a huff a small victory to be sure but quite satisfying nevertheless edit formatting
i jog around my apartment complex since i have a course set that measures almost exactly two miles so its easy for me to measure progress i run at night but i wear the pt shirts from work that have reflective lettering and department logos on the front back and both sleeves the path is almost all on the sidewalk but it crosses the parking lot in two locations there are stop signs in the crosswalks and people frequently cross there since its right next to the community parkpool well i was running last night and i approached this crosswalk i saw this blue corolla approach and slow down i assumed he was going to stop so i continued running this guy decided to accelerate and pass me in his oncoming lane completely blowing the stop sign he sped around and disappeared behind some of the buildings i followed his path and saw where he parked i didnt get to confront the guy but i know it was his car since the hood was still warm well i decided to make another lap and pass by my apartment where i grabbed my daughters giant bottle of glitter i emptied the bottle into the air vent right in front of the windshield the same vent that sucks air when you use your ac or defroster tonight i swung by his car again to see if it was effective i shined the light off my phone into his window and saw glitter all over his console both front seats and a moderate amount into the rear seat i hope he has fun trying to get that stuff out of the cloth seats
i deal with a lot of rude people as a bank teller i get blamed a lot due to the fact that people cannot keep up with their finances i had a kid about come in with his mom a little while ago to put some money into his account he is supposedly supposed to be saving this money that his mom is giving him and while i was filling out the paperwork i heard the mom guessing how much money she thought would be in there once the balance was printed so i do the deposit and automatically i know the balance is way off i double checked the account number it was correct so i completed the deposit and pushed the receipt through the window the kid snatches it with his grubby hands before his mom can and automatically starts telling me ive made a mistake because he should have more than this he starts raising his voice repeatedly telling me im wrong and i need to put the balance back to what it was the mom takes a look at the balance and sort of shrugs it off gets a few more bills from her purse and asks me to put some more into this kids account sure i do the transaction and print out another receipt with a much healthier balance much to the kids delight little did this shit know that while i was doing the transaction i was printing out his transaction history to give to them when they leave i passed it through the window right after i gave the kid his receipt saying i thought i would print out the recent transactions on the account so youll be able to see in detail what processed through and be able to see if theres any discrepancies the kids face dropped as he realized the he spent in the playstation marketplace was now visible to his mom who gave him an earful as they exited the bank i win you snot tldr kid complains his balance is wrong on his account says i made a mistake so his mother deposits more money i give the transaction history to mom before they leave so she can see hes overspending on video games he gets yelled at as they leave the bank
forgive me as this is my first post in rpettyrevenge i lived in an apartment building for a couple years this building was a part of a larger condo association there are town homes and some building with apartments all of which you could own i rented from a landlord the building i was in had two one bedroom apartments in the front about sq ft and two two bedroom apartments in the back about sq ft this was repeated for three floors so apartments in total i had one of the one bedrooms on the first floor where it was me a m at the time and my dog the tenants were a mix of older folks and younger professionals like myself there was one middle aged alcoholic woman that was the pain in everyones ass about a week after i had moved in it was about am and suddenly over the sound of my own tv i hear aerosmith blasting after a quick process of elimination i determine its the drunk upstairs i walk up stairs and not wanting to piss anyone off decide to politely knock on the door and ask her to turn it down after knocking a couple times theres no answer i retreat back to my apartment throw some headphones in and go to sleep the next day upon returning from work i decide to go knock on the door to see if shes home she answers and i politely ask her to try to keep the music down after pm sunday through thursday dont worry about friday or saturday because ill be out or hammered and it wont matter over the course of the next few weeks everything goes smoothly some other neighbors warn me that it will happen again and shes been like this since she moved in i say shame on them for never trying to do anything about it they say youll see sure enough a couple nights later aerosmith is blasting at am i go up and knock on the door she answers the door clearly hammered and calls me an asshole and shuts the door i go back downstairs and call the cops cops arrive shes rude to them and they do nothing but give her a warning they leave and she turns the music back up they come back and only another warning this happens a handful of times after this and i finally accept defeat the cops cant or wont help a few days after this i hear her in the shower as i take a crap her bathroom is right above me the light bulb goes off in my head and i hurry into the basement where theres some storage areas for all tenants and look for a hot water disconnect i determine my revenge will be turning her hot water off every time i hear her in the shower above unfortunately i couldnt find the hot water disconnect i do find another treasure though hidden in a small area behind one of the storage units that you wouldnt even guess was there a large breaker panel i open it up and find breakers for the hallway and staircase lights etc but wait theres a breaker for every individual apartment also my plan is now set and i walk back smirking to my apartmentwaiting finally my day has arrived i wake up at about am and hearaerosmith this time its music to my ears though i grab a flashlight and hurry down stairs i find her apartments breaker and turn it off i take my victory lap around the basement and walk back up to my apartment i can hear stomping and screaming but she cant figure out why her apartments electricity isnt on but the lights in the hallway are i hear her knock on neighbors doors but no one has the answer i smile and go back to sleep the next day i wake up and go turn her power back on i was working from home that day and as i sit at my table and return some emails i see the electrical service guy arrive from the bit of conversation i could eavesdrop on it was clear he had no idea what had happened and thought she was a little crazy after he left i saw her carry out all the food in her fridge that had gone bad as months progressed every so often she would start blasting the music i would go downstairs cut her power off and turn it back on hours later she never picked up on the correlation between her music and losing power somehow every time she would call the electrical service guy i would turn the power back on before he arrived she would then be charged for the visit and lose money throwing out the contents of her fridge this worked for two years up until about a week before i moved and forgot to turn it back on one day and there was a lock on the breaker box tldr neighbor was repeatedly blasting aerosmith late at night so i turned off her power and made her food in the fridge go bad edit changed tldr to be a little more specific and not be just the title
this story happened way back when i was in high school freshman year just moved to a new goddamn state and everything from literally day one when i addressed my first year math teacher as mam i had moved from the deep south she was from new york and she thought i was out to make her look old and frumpy she loathed my guts now this math class was chaos the teacher could not control a classroom my mom was a teacher for years i have serious fucking respect for high school teachers aside from this one kids came to class dressed in banana suits people would take shirts off in the middle of lectures shoes would be tossed and played with like footballs a couple people treated it like designated naptime and slept through everything everyone at this school in a school with over students knew my class period as the one that had major fucking issues and in the middle of all this the only one my teacher would discipline was me so she could feel in control i would always finish my work early because hey it was easy to me i would finish the assigned problems and then pull out a book to read while ignoring all the other year olds yelling and screeching and decidely not doing their work this teacher would see me reading by myself and would make announcements like oh look at zesparia reading again are they done with their work its disrespectful to be doing other things when i am talking the book would be snatched and taken up to her desk with everyone watching and laughing as she would criticize my reading choices this would bleed over to her conversations in general she would bring me up in a conversation to make fun of me or my choices so being a personal punching bag was taking its toll on me i got back in small ways like pointing out when she got problems wrong that she was teaching to the class in front of everyone but this did nothing to address my problems despite feeling satisfying i hatched a plan and one day in may near the end of the year i shoved four copies of the same fantasy book in my bag i think i checked out every copy of the book from the school library plus brought my copy from home that day in class went as normal i finished my work early and pulled out my book she saw me reading and got a nasty grin on her face and stood up and started posturing about how i was reading my dumb books again i needed to learn to focus on my work and not bring stuff like that into a math class she took the book turned around to walk back to her desk spun around and set it down with a flourish and saw me calmly reading the same book in the same spot without missing a beat everyone in the class had seen me dive for my bag and promptly pull out the next book as soon as her back had turned she did a double take looked confused as all fuck as she looked at the one i was holding and the one she had confiscated on her desk she went red in the face and fucking booked it back to my desk as fast as her heels would allow and forcefully grabbed the second book she marched back to her desk and spun around again to see me casually turning the page in the third copy of the book with the class cackling at this point at her reaction she stared but didnt say a word she finally sat at her desk and pretended like nothing was wrong as she went about her shit end of class i picked up my books like normal she refused to even look at me was never a scapegoat for her control issues again tldr teacher tried to use me as a scapegoat for unruly classroom and would take away my personal books i used her behavior to humiliate her in front of the class she could not control edit im not a guy
i work at an entertainment type place think roller skating rink laser tag etc with a cafegrill thing located inside i dont work at the grill but my job involves some down time so when theyre busy and im not i always try to help out a couple days ago we had an enormous birthday party going on there must have been kids and adults and almost every adult decided they wanted food from the grill normally we are not busy during this time so there was only one person scheduled at the grill to take orders ring people up and cook the food of course i rush over to help her and another employee who wasnt busy came too there are now three of us back here in this tiny grill area working as fast as humanly possibly and theres still a really long line other employee is taking orders im getting drinks and delivering food and the original lady is cooking everything as fast as she can then the next guest in line comes up and orders a large coke with no ice our large drinks are gigantic i dont know for sure but i think theyre ounces so with no ice shes already getting a ridiculous amount of soda i fill it as full as i can without the foam spilling over the top and bring it over to her and when i set it down on the counter the foam has settled so that theres about a centimeter of space to the top of the cup she takes one look at it and goes um could i get that filled all the way up while my brain is thinking seriously i hear myself saying oh of course maam ill fill that the rest of the way up for you so i take her cup go back to the soda machine and with extreme precision fill it up all the way to the top its so full that the soda is actually curving a little bit over the surface of the cup i veeeerrry slooowly make my way back to the counter so that i dont spill a single drop and gently set the cup down in front of her with a bright here you go maam as i hand her a plastic lid she had the grace to look slightly ashamed of herself and sort of mumbled oh thank you as she tried to put the lid on and as i turned around to get drinks for the next people in line i saw her trying to wipe off the sides of the cup with napkins as when she had put the lid on it had displaced some of the soda

firstly long time lurker first post ever secondly im typing this from my phone so i apologise for any formatting issue thirdly english isnt my first language so please bear with any spelling or grammatical errors now this happened around years back when i was in my th semester at university one of the lecturers from my department whos normally an ok guy but a douche in this story so lets call him dl informed my section and another that hed be taking one of our hour long free periods to make up for a lecture that was missed for reasons i cant recall fair enough dl had course to cover and missing one hour of freedom doesnt really spell the end of the world however the thing was said free period was right before our lunch break and most students were worried that dls lecture would cut into that despite his assurances that it wouldnt you see while some students eat at the cafeteria a significant number head to their dorms mess which has fixed lunch timings so the hour comes and goes and dl is droning on and on with no end in sight students start to complain but the dl says no one leaves until hes done talking or theyll be marked absent attendance held weightage in our grade so as dl starts eating away at our lunch break i decide to use the tools at hand to exact retribution on behalf of my dorm friends from the mid row bench in the class i begin clicking my ballpoint pen repeatedly the guy next to me begin and then the guy next to him and so on until dls voice was drowned out by the glorious chorus of around a clicking pens he stopped talking tldr lecturer wouldnt end the class on time buried him in pens
a lady and her hellspawn child come into my thrift store the other day and they tear apart browse the childrens books section as theyre making a mess shopping i ask them if i can help them find anything in particular she says no and continues to look at the fiction while her horrid little brat wonderful little blessing leaves books scattered on the floor considers his reading options they pick a book or two bring it up to the counter leaving their paperback trail behind them are you all set then i asked with a smile yes i think thats it she says okill just clean up your mess first i say politely with anything but polite intent and i leave them at the counter while i pick up each book check to make sure it belongs in the childrens section and reshelve it about three books in she comes over and apologises and starts helping put the books back i almost feel that i got through to her
a little bit of background before i get into the petty revenge im a dancer at a strip club in florida its a small club in a relatively conservative area so its pretty tame compared to a lot of other places its more of a bikini bar as we must keep our bottoms on and our nipples covered with tape or tassels at all times under penalty of losing our job which im ok with in the past few years strip clubs have become more mainstream and popular with all types of people not just the clichd perverted old men although we definitely still get those guys we regularly host bachelorette parties couples groups of women and groups of couples come in to enjoy the show we even get middleaged couples theyre always the most fun and surprisingly accepting to the scene for the most part the women are pretty cool with being surrounded by halfnaked strippers and enjoy hanging out with us and were happy to have them there most of themnot all we get the occasional girlfriend or wife who comes in with a holier than thou attitude who just sits there and scowls at everyone clearly she was dragged in against her will and wants to show her displeasure by trying to ruin the night for everyone if you try to make conversation with them they make passiveaggressive remarks putting you and your profession down thats fine dancers have to have tough skin and lots of confidence so we usually just go to the dressing room and laugh about how insecure the girl is for those of you who arent familiar with how most strip clubs are set up here is a brief explanation most have a bar right when you walk in so you can grab a drink there is typically a stage with a dancer on it either in the middle of the club or running along one wall generally the closer to the stage you sit the more open you are to talking to girls and getting private dances the stage will have chairs around it which is called the tip rail at the tip rail you have a very close view of the women on stage but it is heavily implied that you must tip the dancer to sit there at my club there are about a dozen chairs around the stage when a dancer receives a tip at the tip rail she normally does something a little extra for the guy if its a dollar or two i just let them stick it in my gstring if its ill motorboat or shake my butt if its ill wrap my thighs around their neck and jiggle the lady bits anything over ill climb off the stage and give them a second lap dance if a douchebag sits at the tip rail and tips nothing then i will completely ignore them an additional note if youre sitting at the tip rail and all the chairs around the tip rail are full and the club is packed your ass had better be tipping generously because if youre just sitting there taking up space from someone who would otherwise be tipping then youre essentially taking money out of my pocket its truly frustrating but we cant really say anything about it because tipping at the tip rail is only heavily implied not required here is where the petty revenge comes into play every once in a while one of those scowling angry women sits at the tip rail usually with the boyfriend or group of friends who are having a great time and doesnt tip a single dollar her friends are usually tipping but she will just sits there arms crossed pissed off and bitter for the longest time my reaction to these women would be just to ignore them just like i do with nontipping men then i mentioned it to a coworker about how annoying these girls are because they bring down the mood of the night and dont tip when they should be she told me im taking the wrong approach in ignoring them next time it happens treat the girl like she tipped wrap your legs around her neck and stick your crotch right in her face so i did the next time a pissy girl came in and sat at the tip rail during a busy night and didnt tip i showered the girl with attention boobs in her face ass jiggling thighs wrapping around her neck pussy in the face the whole nine yards despite her not tipping a single dollar this is what happened the guys loved it and threw tons of money on the stage because hey girl on girl the woman madder than hell but unable to do anything about it because shes sitting at the tip rail and im just doing my job in addition im the one smiling having a great time while she looks like a curmudgeon its a winwin for me i now do this on a regular basis with almost the exact same results each time i make more money and at the same time piss off someone who clearly looks down upon my job edit i really hate when people edit but its pretty clear some of you have never been to a strip club the atmosphere is very relaxed and chill no one is sexually harassing anyone the tip rail is literally the only place i do this if someone isnt comfortable with it they have a choice of about a hundred other chairs they are more than welcome to sit at without any disturbance 
this is your typical asshole neighbour revenge with a twist i have an asshole neighbour he is an elderlyish man maybe around still works down in town anyway we share the start of our driveway except his goes past my house and down the valley a ways where his house is now we had just got our driveway paved meaning he had to park up on the road for the two days they were laying the sand and pavers its maybe a meter walk down to his house not only did he berate me at long length when our paths met at the letterbox on the first day but on the second he outright abused me in front of my student i tutor drums i told my young student to go inside as he was swearing furiously at me for having the nerve to ask him to park out front for two days fast forward to the next week he decides to park in the middle of where our driveways split up meaning i have to park out on the road keep in mind this is actually my property hes just a prick that night instead of abusing him the next time i saw him i thought of a better revenge in the dead of the night i take a pack of frozen prawns out of my freezer i sneak down my driveway and kneel down by one of his tyres i then begin sliding frozen prawns one by one into his hubcap pushing them far enough in that they are invisible from the out side i systematically fill each of his four hubcaps with two kilos of frozen prawns pounds now keep in mind this is in the middle of a boiling hot australian summer even by the next morning i could smell the prawns had thawed and were beginning to cook over the course of the next week i watched him inspect his car thoroughly trying to work out where the abhorrent stench was coming from he looked in his engine all through his car in his fucking exhaust for christs sake but never deep within his hubcaps they must have festered there for a good month before he finally sold his car the smell was bloody horrible serves him right the cunt tldr australians like to throw a shrimp on the barby amongst other places

ok this just happened today and im still shaking my head in disgust its springsummer cleaning time and i found the cheapest carpet cleaner rental in my area which is for hours plenty of time for my small little place but hold up the store policy states that im required to purchase their carpet cleaner solution with the rental to make sure i use the correct product fine whatever ill just get a small bottle because hey my carpet space small only problem is all of the carpet cleaning solutions from small to medium size bottles are sold out the dust on the shelf tells me theyve been sold out for quite some time too the only bottles left are the industrial sized gallon jugs of the oxyclean expensive stuff wtf restock much the sales clerk and i come to verbal blows because im not spending on oz of carpet cleaning solution the mod finally appears and is less than helpful has no intention of being understandable or reasonable i attempt to compromise by going to another store of theirs miles away to pick up the correct size solution if they have it on hand no he is having none of it i asked to speak to corporate and im given one of their phones to call while on hold i start googling diy carpet cleaning solution and find an ultra cheap alternative on the top search in fact the store that i was at had of the ingredients right there for each i speak to a corporate official and its their policy that i must purchase solution with the rental for insurance reasons wtf seriously i then asked what the return policy was on unused product that i purchase that has a receipt the official said i could return all unopenedunused product within xx amount of days he even caught on to what i was implying but policy is policy i hang up head down a few aisles pick up the ingredients that i needed return to the counter and complete the transaction gt machine rental gt tub of solution gt household cleaner gt oxyclean microbox i headed home and quickly mixed the laundry detergent and softener i had already added the household cleaner and scoop of oxyclean single best carpet cleaner ive ever used hands down been renting machines for years and i was impressed at how good this solution was used about oz of the diy solution with enough left over for next time around i finished in about hours and loaded up the machine as i returned the rental i asked that the carpet solution be credited back as well the same mod i spoke too not hours ago threw a major hissyfit saying that im not allowed to return the product told him to dial the same corporate official i spoke with i told him flat out that had he restocked i would have gladly purchased and used the smaller bottle the look on his face as he was forced to return the solution was all the victory i needed thats what you get for pulling this purchase policy scam and not restocking normal inventory tldr store manager enforces a policy that requires me to purchase expensive cleaning solution with my machine rental i created a diy cleaning solution that was far superior and i returned the unopened bottle to a scowling manager his scam didnt work edit im including the link to the diy solution by popular request i made some recommended changes to the household cleaner addin but otherwise its untouched from what i used 
i was reminiscing on my past job today when i remembered a petty revenge story that occurred while i was working last summer before university i worked at a childrens birthday party place it was an awesome job playing with kids getting leftover pizza and cake and the pay was way better than the minimum wage food service job im working now anyways two workers were assigned to each party there was a lead and an assistant most people became leads after working for months and showing that you can handle the job and communicate well with the parentskids while both jobs were nearly the same the lead got to do a few of the cooler things such as introducing the rules to the kids before switching gyms it was actually really fun we would always make them play simon says to get their attention so they would line up initiating the zipline and cutting the cake i was so excited when i finally became a lead along with all that there was a pay raise it was great heres where things get slightly annoying there was this girl who worked there well call her carly whose mom knew the manager she worked there much longer than any of us like years she was known for leaving early not doing her closing duties sitting down on the job etc just a general bad employee that none of us really liked because she made our job harder she never became a lead although she was perpetually stuck being an assistant she liked to play her own little game of trying to take over and act as a lead with the new leads on multiple occasions i had to work with her and each time she tried to line the kids up start zipline without telling me and one time she even tried to cut the cake hell no i made sure she didnt get to cut the cake by the way cutting the cake was what i lived for anyways one day she pulls out the zipline minutes early without telling me me hey its kind of early for zipline carly well i want to do it early today me i dont know if thats a good idea the kids will get bored later if carly interrupts hey birthday kid do you want to do zipline of course he says yes fine i go with the flow heres where it gets petty and revengy carly is a bit well moderately overweight she tires very easy i mentioned above that shes often found sitting when were supposed to be constantly active and energetic we start zipline get all the kids lined up i explain the rules it was a large party kids or so all around years old me carly since you wanted to do zipline you can lead this one the lead is responsible for holding the kids and running down the gym with them the assistant only has to hold a rope this is the worst part of being the lead its fucking exhausting having to hold multiple kids up and run to the opposite side of a large gym with them especially because many of them dont hold onto the bar very tight and parents get pretty upset when you drop their kid carly okay so we go through kids ziplining down a hot gym and boy oh boy is carly exhausted she starts to tell me shes going to get water carly im gonna go get some water ill me wait were not done carly what me hey birthday boy do you want to go again he and all of his lb friends get excited and get back in line to do the zipline again carly were only supposed to give them one turn me well we started minutes early so we have plenty of time commence carlys second workout of the day tldr made a bunch of kids happy a bitchy girl got a good workout and i still got to cut the cake
not mine as i was only privileged to observe not deliver i was on a thursday afternoon flight from dc to new york this flight is perhaps not surprisingly generally filled with bankers lobbyists and other suits who generally know the drill once in a while though you get a guy who decides that his personal business is more important than everyone elses desire to get home on this day i had the unfortunate luck to be seated in the aisle seat next to one of these people in this case a stereotypical year old bankerfinance guy slightly balding dressed in a suit that fit him just a little too loosely he was yelling over the phone at someone to get him on this deal loudly enough for the entire cabin of the a to hear i shrugged put in my headphones and started blasting music to drown out the details of his deal figuring that hed probably hang up once we pushed off the gate nope the doors slammed shut the plane pushed off the gate and the flight attendant an industry veteran with the look of someone who had been doing her job a little too long finally finishes her safety demo as shes walking down the aisle during the seatbelt check she reminds him with the broadest forced smile sir youre not on the phone are you the captain will take us back to the gate and remove you he stammers an apology and promises to hang up a minute later the plane is in line to takeoff the attendant walks back up and notices that he hasnt hung up the smile is gone sir i really will ask the captain to remove you off this plane she threatens and she watches him as he reluctantly gets off the phone seemingly satisfied the attendant walks back up front but a moment later she comes back with all the safety demo equipment the oxygen mask the seat belt and the safety manual she stands right next to me and stares at phone guy excuse me sir she said i do need to ensure that you heard the entirety of the safety demo the guy tries to stammer that he really did know the safety protocol but the hostess silences him sir it is crucial that i make sure you understand protocol as it presents a safety risk to you and others if you missed the demonstration the surrounding passengers start snickering as phone guy reddens and hes forced to sit and pay attention through how to properly operate a seatbelt where the exit doors are and how to put on the oxygen mask please assist yourself before you attempt to assist others the hostess reminds him grinning widely as she snaps the mask on the demonstration takes a couple of more minutes at the end of which the guy is reduced to staring straight down at his phone bright as a tomato upon landing he immediately starts up his call again but in a whisper instead and hurries out of the plane without making eye contact with anyone never mess with flight attendants

i like my bread and i pay more a loaf for the brand i like so its fresh soft and tasty id just bought a new loaf with plans of making some pbampj and more specifically a grilled cheese to go with the tomato soup id bought im a college student and my food budget is a little limited so sadly a good loaf of bread with the means to make some sandwiches is a treat i went to sleep before work while images of tasty sandwiches danced in my head i woke up and went into the kitchen to make my sandwiches only to find that my entire loaf of bread was gone i already knew what had happened i went to my roommate and asked him where my bread went he told me oh i ate it while you were sleeping like he didnt just ruin my meal plans for the day i asked so what the hell am i supposed to eat before work he said i didnt really think about that relax ill buy you a new loaf i scrape together something to eat and head off to work eased a little by the knowledge that my bread will be replaced and i can have a sandwich when i get home fast forward hours i get home put my things away wash up and head to the kitchen to make my sandwich i see sitting on the counter a loaf of the cheapest generic brand crap he could find i kid you not this stuff is hard and tastes like cardboard when its fresh i proceed to flip my shit he knows what kind of bread i eat and its right next to the shit he bought his response was chill man its only bread i know that he is extremely picky about the beer he drinks and always keeps a pack of his favorite in the fridge to get my revenge i wait until he goes to work and i drink his entire pack and replace it with a pack of natural light i lined the bottles up on the counter so hed be sure to see them and waited he gets home a few hours later puts his shit away washes up and walks to the fridge to get a beer he sees the bottles and yells dude you drank all my beer i yell back relax i got you some more he opens the fridge sees the pack of inferior beer and storms into my room beer in hand what the fuck is this shit this isnt what i drink to which i reply chill man its just beer tldr roommate ate my good bread and replaced it with crap so i drank all his good beer and replaced it with natural light edit yes it was a whole loaf of bread he crushes a bunch of pieces together and eats the lump like an apple ive seen him down a whole loaf before thats how i knew what had happened as soon as my loaf was missing
anon account for the obvious my stepsister was raised to expect everything handed to her on a platter shes the firstborn idol of her side of the family shes not an only child but she fills every cliche of the spoilt brat only kid i feel sorry for her brother and sister they get treated so differently although theyre okay people for it they do miss out on a lot from their parents stepsister is also a bigoted racist cow the filth that spills from her mouth and her attitudes about anybody who isnt attractive cool or normal is sickening ive lived with it for years and im pretty bitter about it though i keep the peace for my moms sake worst thats happened between us is a screaming match where i ended up bawling and wilting because she hates the idea of gays being visibly gay gays being allowed around kids gay marriage and she wonders out loud why we cant just shut the fuck up and hide like good little freaks me im lesbian and out im not terribly confident at the best of times though ill stand my ground when it comes to that kind of bigotry but her confidence is absolute she feels shes right all the time and entirely dismisses anything that stands in the way of her bigotry and goes into attack if she feels threatened and everything threatens her fuck i hate her occasionally i check her facebook page were not friended but its well worth seeing what shes up to in order to prepare for her dramas before they hit the family before her wedding she had a meltdown on facebook at the cost of the photographer she wanted i know the guy she wanted to use and hes damned good and charges worthwhile prices for good work the kicker here is thats my profession too most of my income comes through my photography commercial and product though not weddings thankfully and in a little post on the wall of a friend of hers hidden from general view she said she planned to get around even paying for a wedding photographer by inviting me she knows i always have a camera on me and one or another of them comes with me everywhere the presumptive cow decided shed get free wedding photos out of me day of the wedding i brought my worst camera body with a broken flash and a useless mm lens a rubbish lens to start with that i borrowed ironically from the photographer she wouldnt pay for and had suffered from a water spill it took photos with bad halos around everything and i took photos constantly in small jpg mode she asked for the photos from me after the wedding and i gave her the cards with them all on straight from the camera it made her cry she went fucking mental at me to her and my family but not a soul except her and her husband lay any blame on me for taking shit photos because hey i was never hired for the job and never told to my face id be needed as a photographer let alone paid for anything if she had a clue beyond the superficial shed realize that her wedding the actual event and the marriage that followed was the most special part of it all but no she considers the ability to show off her wedding to be the most important thing and i removed some of that ability from her i took a small professional hit im sure but i can live with that if it keeps her away from me
a few years ago i was trying to find a parking spot on campus before class in the lot right next to the building my class was in there was one spot left but an suv with a ton of bumper stickers had parked badly and was taking up about a third of that last spot my only other option was to go park in a different parking lot that was about a fifteen minute walk away from my class i had less than five minutes before class started my car was small enough to fit in the remaining spot with about an inch of clearance between my car and mr suvs driverside door oh well i wasnt late to class after class the suv was gone and there was a note on my windshield that said nice parking job asshole i was pretty annoyed because i wasnt the one who parked shittily in the first place but i stuck the note in my purse forgot about it and went on with my day a couple weeks later i saw the same suv with all the bumper stickers in the same parking lot parked terribly i remembered i still had his note in my purse i left it on his windshield and went on with my day merrily i hope he recognized his own handwriting 
my husbands grandmother is a bitch when we lived all with my fatherinlaw she made my life hell because she was so narcissistic and cruel this woman loved puzzles shes old and so overweight that she can barely move so she sits in her special recliner all day doing puzzles and barking orders at people telling me how terrible i am one day she was doing this very tough very large puzzle it was like pieces and mostly blue sky i stole one of those motherfucking pieces and burned it in the wood stove that kept the house warm unfortunately we moved out before she finished the puzzle so i didnt get to see her reaction when she couldnt finish it it was so petty but felt so good 
i worked as a bartender in an irish pub connected to a hotel for the last couple of years and generally enjoy it except for odd occurrences like anybody else in the service industry anyway since it is connected to a hotel we get a lot of businessmen who stay frequently this one guy lets call him chad stayed in the hotel mondaythursday every single week and frequented our bar and by frequented i mean he was there from our pm open to close every single day he was there chad always bragged about how much money he makes yet he was a poor tipper would always criticize others food choices tell them to go to other places for food and he made snide remarks about how weak my drinks are i actually have a decently heavy hand i pour ounces in a drink instead of the typical ounce pour among other things basically chad is a gradea dbag chads drink of choice was a grey goose ginger which ran him per drink and he rarely drank less than of them so he always ran a decent sized tab every single drink he would ask me if i forgot to put the alcohol in his drink or make some other remark about how weak the drink was it really bugged me because i pour right in front of my customers so they can see their drink being prepared he would always try things to get more alcohol like asking me for a tall a tall in reality is just a bigger glass so you get more mix but the same amount of alcohol one day and everyday after that i decided to take revenge on chad by giving him less alcohol by plugging the air hole so the alcohol flows out much slower making the illusion that he is getting the same or more than usual when in reality he is getting about ounce of alcohol and then i finish it with a quick pour down the straw so his first sip is strong as a result he started buying around drinks instead of the normal so he wasted about more dollars per night and got less drunk suck it chad 
well this is going to be an interesting story to tell so my sister has a friend whom i will call nutjob nutjob has a boyfriend whom shes known for about a year and a half theyre both early s and still in university now shes absolutely babycrazy and hes not exactly into that sort of thing i personally think that the debate of whether to have children is something that you really need to establish before you continue your relationship because its a big deal but whatever anyway apparently nutjobs been taking his used condoms andemptying them into her i dont know how it works exactly just ignore the fact that a lot of condoms have spermicide in them now no matter what way you want to look at it its a pretty fuckedup way to try and get pregnant almost as bad as poking holes in them fortunately nutjobs boyfriend found out unfortunately he didnt know what to do dudes kind of still in love with her even though shes completely out of her mind at this point he phones me up a couple of nights ago and asks for help dealing with the problem since ive been in a pretty good relationship for four years and i know how to deal with these kinds of problems i told him to call her on it and break up with her as soon as possible because this can actually have more severe ramifications than cheating imo i also added that he might want to use a decoy condom filled with tobasco sauce never in my life did i think hed actually do that i assume shes been doing this when it was dark or something because theres no fucking way you could look at a condom filled with tobasco and say to yourself yes this is something i want inside of me i dont know the exact details all i know beyond that is that she called my sister in the middle of the night practically screaming and then my sister called me at about am to completely bitch me out over it i probably didnt do myself any favours by laughing my ass off about it like that so its fair to say that my sisters angry at me again and nutjob suspects that i had something to do with this i dont care lying to your so about this sort of thing and trying to accidentally fall pregnant is scummy as shit i dont think shell be doing it again any time soon though tldr got my sisters friend to finger herself with hot sauce to stop her from trying to conceive in secret
baked goods everyone loves baked goods my sister she probably loves them more then anyone so on the day she was down and depressed after breaking up with her boyfriend my brother and i swore to bring her cheer with a delicious chocolate cake we venture out the front door and hop into his jeep and set on down the road to the local grocer we arrive and as we are looking to park this women who we will call the blob cuts us off and steals the parking spot we were waiting for we shrugged it off as we are pretty relaxed fellows and parked in another spot we make way into the grocery store head directly to the baked goods counter and wait in line to be served the blob pulls up behind us chattering away obnoxiously on her cell phone and completely oblivious to what was around her our turn to be served comes up we select the last remaining chocolate cake and ask the baker to out a message on our cake she said it would take about ten minutes as there was a line and we told her we would be back to pick up our order as we were walking away the blob asks for a chocolate cake and is told there is none left and that we got the last one she begins freaking out in a very entitled tone and demands that she receive said cake since we cut her off in the bakery line however the baker assures her we were here first and she would have to pick a different cake at this point we could no longer hear what was happening but we didnt care as the blob stole our parking spot and got her just desserts as we took the last chocolate cake however our dealing with the blob were far from over we headed to the frozen aisle to grab some pizza pockets fries chicken fingers and other delectable snack foods as we were pretty starved we headed back to the bakery counter only to find a different person behind the counter we ask her for our cake and are told our sister picked it up she then points down the bread aisle to the blob with our cake in her motherfucking cart now most people would walk away and let this bitch eat her cake but we were not backing down we followed her for some time through the grocery store we decided to wait for an opportune moment and steal our cake back the second she turned to grab something from the dairy fridge we gallopped over grabbed the cake and ran headlong to the checkout looking back we saw she was distracted on her phone again and did not notice the cake was missing we paid for our groceries and headed out to the truck as we were leaving we realized that maybe we could get a little extra revenge on her so we wrote up a note indicating how delicious the cake was and that she should thank us for saving her the calories we tucked this under the wiper of her car and drove off just as she was walking out her face was red and puffed with air we could tell she was angry as hell that we got our cake back tldr fat blob steals cake we steal it back
so i use to work at a fast food place and nothing will make you lose faith in humanity faster than that or a retail job anyways i am working the drive thru window where you hand the people their shit wave em off and on to the next one i also have to make the customers drinks we like most places have an automated soda fountain that with the press of a button fills the cup with soda its very helpful being able to fill up different cups of ice and watch them all fill up simultaneously pretty satisfying too now to the story next car pulls up its a dad and his daughter i hand pops his drinks and hes looking at them oddly after i hand off the sodas he says to me annoyed could you bother filling these up all the way buddy the drinks fill up automatically and ever single time not even a half inch below from the brim of the cup for a couple of reasons so when you put the straw in soda doesnt spurt out so when i put the lid on your drink soda doesnt come out the sides but nope this guy really acted like i was stiffing him here what do i do i give my fakest smile and wow okay sorry about that ever and proceed to fill up his sodas to the brim to the point where the soda is over the brim barely clinging together from overflowing then i put the lids on of course soda comes out and the lids are distorted looking like theyre about to burst from the pressure of the soda they are still retaining within the cup i made sure to wipe of the sides of the cups i then hand him the drinks here you go bud he felt accomplished but when i said that i noticed he knew he might have overreacted i think not sure meh he then goes to put his straw in soda shoots out the straw opening out from the lids sides and all over his cup holder and car i had handed off his food to him already so it was pretty glorious watching him fumble around in his bag for napkins while his embarrassed high school daughter bitched him out for asking for more soda he could have asked for more napkins too as i stared at him i never closed the window but he didnt he did what he needed to do never look at me again and leave 
i work at a small pet store and we sell two things in abundance dog food and crickets as for crickets we sell them at twenty for now the store is almost always busy so we dont have time to actually count out twenty crickets we usually eyeball it keeping our guesstimations on the generous side customers dig it because they usually get a few more crickets than they asked for and we get to save time and generate a little good will one day a customer comes in and asks for one hundred large crickets lets call him clyde no problem i tell him as im gathering the crickets into the bag i ask him about what hes feeding them to and we get to talking about lizards tarantulas and other cricketeaters clyde seems alright at this point i genuinely enjoy talking about animals with the customers i hand clyde the bag of about one hundred crickets and he takes a long look at it turning it this way and that he looks at me and skeptically asks if theres really a hundred crickets there looks like or he says mind you everyone at the store is very good at guesstimating how many crickets are in a bag we all know what and crickets look like and in all the time ive worked there ive never been questioned by a customer my immediate emotional response was somewhere between annoyance and wounded pride so i did the reasonable logical thing i took the bag back and i told him id count every single cricket cause ill be damned if he doesnt get exactly one hundred crickets so i painstakingly count each cricket by dropping them one by one from the first bag into a new bag he watches me the whole time making comments here and there like unnecessary and im sure it was a hundred but nay i tell him i want to make absolutely sure that you get the crickets you paid for as i count my hundredth cricket i look at the remainder in the bag lo and behold there are ten crickets leftover a whole fifty cents as i hand clyde the new bag of exactly one hundred crickets and toss the rest back into the bin i thank him for keeping me and the store honest and assure him that ill count his crickets every time he comes in from now on havent seen him since 
i worked at a nice star hotel in a very rich suburb in i worked the weekend night audit shift to have a little extra spending money while i was finishing up my masters degree since the rest of my weekly money was going to pay my bills it was saturday morning around am and i had just gotten finished putting all of the room checkout slips under the doors of the people checking out i was in back finishing up my paperwork when i hear ding ding ding i would put a bell out if i was in back working so i knew when people came up to the desk i reply i will be back up in a minute and i heard ding ding ding again i ignore it since i knew he heard me then he starts hitting the bell incessantly until i finally come up i come around the corner and take the bell out of his hands since hes still ringing it even though im in front of him i smile and say how can i help you and he replies theres a mistake on my bill i take the bill and look at it check his account and say i dont see any mistakes on the bill what do you think is in error he replies these video charges they arent mine i look at the bill again and see around in video movie charges i reply back sir these were movies were checked out of your room and the system automatically processes them he looks uncomfortable and he then accuses the housekeeping staff of renting the movies while he was out of his room i highly doubt this but trying to give him the benefit of the doubt i say i will look into it he says hell come back in a little bit i go back to the movie rental system and print out his rental report i dont really review it because i need to check my audit paperwork and finish running my reports he returns around am and in tow with him are a group of other adults and kids checking out hes chatting with them so i assume theyre in the same group he asks me if i have removed the charges and i go and grab his checkout report one thing you should know is that the rental system in most hotels will tell the hotel staff exactly what movies were watched when they were watched and how long they were watched usually if movies are flipped on by mistake usually by a kid or rollingsitting on the remote most people catch it within the first few minutes and call down immediately to have the charges removed which we have no problem with because hey it happens i look over his report and all the movies rented are adult films they were all watched for minutes and they were all late at night at almost the same exact time there is no way the housekeeping staff was here that late at night or would be in someones room it was hard not to smirk but i put a smile on my face and politely say im sorry sir but the rental report shows that you did check out these movies and watch them i show him the report and his face totally falls then this guy narrows his eyes and out of no where stars yelling at me are you calling me a liar im telling you i did not rent these movies your housekeeping staff are the ones who watched these movies they are stealing my hard earned money and im going to sue you and the hotel well i do not take well to being yelled at or being told im going to be sued so in front of all his friends and their kids i loudly start reading the times movie titles and how long they were watched for a few of the adults start pulling their kids away from him a few starting laughing at him and one guy even said you sicko just pay the nice lady your bill for your pornos the best part all the titles were for granny porn he grabs the bill from me and runs out of the hotel literally ran a bunch of the adults start laughing harder and i hope is that to this day they have not let him live it down tldr guy in hotel has about in adult movie rentals he accuses the housekeeping staff of watching them in his room so i read the list of granny porn he watched out loud to him in front of his friends edit spelling edit not sure what to say to those who think its fake i really have no way of proving it true or false i havent worked with the company since i graduated in and the only thing i have are my tax forms to prove i worked there so think what you want it happened and ive been laughing about it for years just wanted others to share in my little bit of revenge since i dont get to do it that often its a self post so i dont get any karma for it one way or the other edit thanks to the redditor who gave my other story below reddit gold edit i could hardly believe my eyes when i saw my other story below on rbestof im glad you all have enjoyed it so much trust me anyone who has worked in hospitality will have their own stories like this
i live in an apartment complex but its unique in its layout i live above a doctors office but my apartment sits directly above a tunnel for the doctors crew to get to the parking lot this means i have neighbors one behind me best friend one directly next to me layers of thick concrete makes a great sound barrier and one directly adjacent to my place since the school year started the adjacent people play loud music on weekends and talk loudly in the tunnel creating an echo chamber in my room i hate them they always get pissy when i bang on the floor or walls to quiet down they usually go louder and harder from it today my vengeance made itself known woke up early to work on some stuff am and turned on a song the volume low i hear the neighbors banging on their wall but my music is so quiet i dont know why eventually they scream at me to turn it off they kept me up all night last night fuck them i turn up my bass all the way and play bass canon for minutes straight the whole time the neighbor is screaming bloody murder at me i danced naked the whole time
so im doing my morning commute from the suburbs into the city i get to the platform about minutes before the express train which arrives in the city a little after at there is a local which arrives at at the local still was not at the platform i am standing towards the edge of the platform because i was one of the first ones there i was behind the yellow line which is the area on the edge of the platform they reccommend you do not stand on because it is an unnecessary danger being that close to the tracks the way it works is that the first people stand towards the front of the platform so they get on first classic first comefirst serve at this woman comes pushing past everyone on the platform she goes behind me and i dont know if she only meant to nudge me didnt see me or meant to push me because she was having a bad day i stumbled forward and almost fell on the tracks i was starting to catch myself but i realized i was probably going to have to jump down onto the tracks then climb back up to avoid falling on the metal tracks onto my face i was going slow enough that some nice person behind me grabbed my backpack and stopped my forward momentum i thanked the man for his kind action and he said loudly how obnoxious that lady was she either didnt or pretended not to hear i realized because she arrived at she didnt know the hadnt come yet so i thought of a quick revenge plan i moved towards her so i was next to her and at the local arrived as it was pulling into the station she said aloud to no one in particular this is the express right i said yes maam because she pushed her way past everyone and was at the front she made sure to rush and be the first one on no one else followed her the conductor said delayed local but becuase she had moved so fast to get the seat she wanted the doors closed before she got out and left me a glaring look i just kinda smirked and people around me chuckled the arrived minutes later it was a good petty way to start the day
as promised an update has been posted here warning this is not my revenge and is only something i witnessed backstory i take the train everyday from a suburb to the city the train station i use is small and only has trains each morning that lead to the city they are about hour apart and arrive at and i take the train each morning and a handicapped able to walk but in a very slow manner with canes man takes it along with the rest of us commuters the train station has a very strong bottleneck where people who just parked their car file into a ft corridor and follow it for ft it basically means you have to be in a single file line leading to the train so our story begins yesterday i was walking through the corridor and see the handicapped man waiting for the train per usual i sit down at a bench waiting for my train pop in some headphones and begin listening to some oldies to relax before my work day begins enter inconsiderate woman or iw she has a walk about her that just screams suburban entitled woman you could just tell she had a way about her that was unpleasant its and our train is arriving she is standing behind the handicapped man and just seems agitated for some reason the crowd begins flowing into the train and she is in a rush even though the train wont leave until everyone has entered she is tapping her foot incessantly waiting for our double caned man to step onto the train he drops a cane and is forced to pick it up iw cant take it anymore and steps around him and accidentally hits him with her giant name brand expensive bag he kind of side steps trying to catch himself and she walks onto the train without looking back people around start helping him and he regains his composure and cane we all get on and as i passed him you could tell he was embarrassed i felt awful the rest of the day went normally and i awoke the next day to continue my routine as i arrived to the train station and walked through the corridor at i notice the handicapped man isnt there no sign still nothing the train arrives and we all get on as usual but hes nowhere to be found i sit down and get a window seat the conductor could not see them in the corridor so he began leaving the station i look out as the train is leaving and can see through the corridor handicapped man has dropped one of his canes and behind him is iw absolutely livid red in the face wanting to scream for the high heavens she couldnt pass him if she tried my first thought is that he dropped a cane on accident and will miss his train oh no he stands up with both canes and smiles at all us watching through the window im not sure if everyone else knew but i did he purposely dropped that cane and forced her to be late by at least a half hour to wherever she was going some may think he did it on accident but that smile spoke to me it was a smile of pure bliss and petty revenge tldr handicapped man canes a woman edited to clear up some confusion on the conductor waiting for them 
many years ago i was about years of age and went into a gas station to buy smokes the guy behind the counter asked for my id this doesnt bother me because is the legal age and i always got carded but then he says this is a fake id im not selling you cigarettes and i recall the smile on his face that showed he knew he was abusing his power and there is nothing i could do about it after a few days i go back into the convenience store of the gas station and notice he is working the counter and then the thought hit me i will buys tons of stuff as much as my arms can carry and sit there and make him ring it all up i grab lots of small items just to make the process longer then i make sure to queue up to be at his counter it took forever to ring up then when he told me the total price i look him right in the eye and flatly say oops forgot my wallet in the car i then go to my car and drive away knowing he will probably have to scan each item again to cancel the sale edit wow front page over night for this silly story thanks all also as pointed out the better ending is dude having to restock it all this all happened before camera phones existed but a great ending would be a pic of him restocking everything on reddit amiright 
like many others on this site i enjoy to smoke some green from time to time and usually on fridays i meet my guy at our usual spot to pick up my stash but today was different i met my guy did the deal and walked towards my motorcycle some guy then stopped me and asked some questions about my bike he even put his coffee cup on my bike which i thought was very odd i then asked him very politely to remove his cup so i could get on my way he then told me to wait a second because he had to talk to me about something he then said i just witnessed a drug deal you dont happen to have some on you i denied it and tried to sit down on my bike he then threatened me and said that if i didnt give up my stash he was going to call the cops i considered the risks and thought that this little amount of pot was not worth risking my job and a big fine so i gave it up luck has it that about seconds after i handed over the goods and he walked away a police officer walked around the corner i quickly went up to him and said i just saw that guy smoking a joint the police officer went up to him asked him to empty his pockets and he was arrested and brought down to the station karma is a bitch edit front page wow never thought id get here 
back in college my suitemates decided to prank a friend of ours who lived on the floor above us during an entire sunday afternoon of us blew up balloons which we stored in one of our bedrooms and once our friend went to work on monday evening at the campus library we filled her room from floor to ceiling with the balloons ironically as a relatively direct result of this prank she and i began dating she mentioned playfully that she would get me back for the balloon prank but that i would probably never realize what she had done her revenge was so subtle that i indeed had no idea that anything had been done to create the minor annoyance that plagued me for the remainder of our time at college she sewed a library book security into the inside of my backpack so every time i left the library i set off the alarm and had my backpack searched
a few years ago my friend and i went into taco bell to grab some food to go my friends food came first and he went over to the sauce area and grabbed a few sauce packets or at the most all of a sudden i heard the manager from behind the counter shout condescendingly have you had enough my friend sheepishly tried to defend himself saying he barely grabbed any the manager insisted that hes had enough and should just stop he was confused and embarrassed and just walked out i was so pissed at her that as soon as my food came out i went over to the sauce area and grabbed the entire bin of hot sauce and quickly left lets just say that justice was delicious for the next year in my apartment i wish i couldve seen the managers face when she saw all the sauce was gone
about years ago my girlfriends friend had just graduated from university she had managed to land a very high paying job in the private sector she would constantly brag about how she was making soooo much money and how she had an expensive car she would tell all her friends they need to get their asses in gear so everyone could be like her this girl was the definition of bitch fast forward about years she has now landed a new higher paying job with the government after being with them for about a year she hurts her back and is on longterm disability for months and there is no sign of her going back to work anytime soon you would think that someone with an injured back would not do a lot of physical activity like skiing partying at the bars etc she had a desk job and everyone knew she was faking the best part about all this she was posting pictures and adding comments on facebook about all the fun she was having after months of observing this i did some research and tracked down the name of the insurance company that handles government workers i filed an anonymous complaint and thought nothing would happen about a year later i found out she had been sued by the government for over in claimed wages while she was on disability she tried to fight it in court but the insurance company had hired a private investigator and tracked her every move they had screen grabs of her facebook statuses as well as photos taken by the investigator from his car of her doing recreation activities proving her back was ok she lost the fight and had to pay the k she lost her job went bankrupt and had to move back in with her parents she is currently a year old unemployed single woman living in an isolated rural area with her parents edit i love the idea from bellewhether about sending her the card unfortunately she still doesnt know i did it and no one else does so i cant send the card however an anonymous ecard might work thanks for the suggestions even my girlfriend who is now my wife doesnt know

little back story a little while ago i worked at a cool dingy bar where when customers were rude to us we were encouraged to stand up for ourselves rather than politely smile drinks were hard and cheap and we were known for some of our destructive shots a regular who was always a dick to everybody no grounds to throw him out yet tho was dicking around as usual and while trying to be cool in front of his friends grabbed my ass this is a total no bueno but i let it go just as it happens a little later he comes to the bar and to try to impress the gang again orders our harshest shot tequila absinthe jgermeister and a few drops of tabasco sauce fucknuggets like him need to be punished and its my time to shine he isnt paying any attention to what im doing in the bar so i pour a tiny bit of the alcohols needed and top it up with tabasco which makes most of the shot now he cheers takes the shot everybodys having a good time until he starts silently crying coughing and then finally yelling at the top of his lungs and begging for an ambulance thats where my smug smile appears when i calmly state do not grab my ass again edit i didnt kick him out on the spot because none of my coworkers were there yet nor the bouncer so as a girl i have to pick my fights standing against a bunch of guys in an empty bar didnt seem appealing at the time
all the recent posts about parking lot revenge reminded me of this one years ago i worked with a guy who grew up in chicago during the s he told the story of one particularly nasty winter when he and his father spent a long time clearing their driveway only to come home later and find a neighbors car parked in it his father was enraged but rather than heading off to thrash the owner he got a water hose and sprinkler out of storage and hooked them up he set the sprinkler so it would cover the car pretty evenly turned it on and walked away the car was soon a car shaped iceberg the owner must have taken the hint because they never caught him trying to get into it but occasionally ice would be chipped away around the door it took multiple attempts before they finally managed it though especially since his dad slosh another bucket of water over it now and then 
we have a house across the road from another longterm resident and both of us live next door to student housing that causes its share of problems one of those being a fellow who parks his car on either of our lawns if he cant get any other offstreet parking thats gone as far as parking perpendicularly across my driveway and getting aggro when weve asked him to move hes been parked on my neighbours lawn for just over four hours my neighbours auto sprinkler system comes on repeatedly every minutes idiot parker has two of his windows down i dont know my memory keeps failing me i keep seeing it and thinking i should head across and warn him but i just turn away and theres new stuff on reddit and i just keep getting distracted how about that new kitten picture guys
i work security and were supposed to report certain things to the local police department whose sole purpose is to respond to shit either we or one of the other departments calls in litterally our work sitehas its own police subdivision now normally ill filter out most useless stuff that fixes itself in under ten minutes because the local police are technically my bosss bosses and i dont want to piss them off by calling in pointless shit this still has me calling maybe times a day that was until i found out the dispatcher that works my shift was talking shit about me and how much she hated working with me because i called everything in keep in mind this is third shift and none of the other departments are active save mine and that she didnt like having to deal with our calls and just ignored everything i reported any way because she felt it wasnt their job to respond to our side of things even though were explicitly told not to do anything but observe and report thats where she fucked up i dont care if she doesnt like me because whatever i dont know her so fuck it but her not responding to our calls when it could be dangerous to my coworkers and i pissed me off just a bit i started calling everything in so now i end up calling them maybe three or four times as much since now im calling in every time theres a small problem and every time the problem fixes itself and every time they havent responded i report that to my supervisor who reports and documents it with the police officer in charge of the area causing more paperwork for everyone there bitch wants to play that way i can play that way byuhdoing my job better i guess
so im at the checkout stand in the grocery store cart completely full of groceries i start unloading my things onto the conveyor belt pretty standard im not even a quarter of the way through loading everything up when this hugenormous quivering hambeast of a woman comes panting into line behind me she immediately hefts two packs of mountain dew onto the conveyor belt behind my stuff no divider or anything she just stands there and sweats i was a bit dumbfounded at first because here i was with my cart still full of groceries that need to be put on the belt and now her cases of soda were taking up any available room having never been faced with this particular breach of grocery checkout protocol i nodded to my cart and told her uh ive still got a few things to load up here she glared at me and huffed well i only have two things so you should have let me go ahead of you you rude shit this lady the hell not only had i already been loading everything up but the clerk had begun ringing up the items well before she had even truffleshuffled her way over to the line if wed gotten there at the same time sure i would have let her go ahead but apparently she could not wait to lug that mountain dew out of her cart and onto the belt being generally nonconfrontational i cracked an eyebrow at her comment and tried to load up more items tetrisstyle when it became apparent that there was simply no more room to be had i turned and asked her you mind moving that stuff back a bit so i can get the rest of my groceries up here still panting from the intense exertion of lifting two cases of soda she responded with im not moving a goddamn thing at this point that little voice in my head that was saying hey zerbo dont be an asshole to this lady was now saying dude just do it so i narrowed my eyes and without a word lifted up both cases of soda and put them back into her shopping cart while she asks me what the hell im doing and flips out at the realization that she will once again have to put her body through the grueling exercise that is lifting two cases of soda i finish getting my items loaded onto the nowunoccupied conveyor belt while swiping my card to finish the transaction she begins bumping my hip with her shopping cart on purpose repeatedly like a child i turn to her again and once again i dont say a thing but this time i reached into her cart and ripped the cardboard handles off her cases of soda brutally like i was the lion of the checkout lane and those sodas were the innards of a dying gazelle while id only intended to rip the handles off to make them harder to lift i had instead compromised the structural integrity of both boxes and all the cans of soda within came tumbling out inside her cart so she began shrieking with indignant rage and i tried my hardest not to laugh by that time my transaction was done and i went on my merry way while the rest of the store stared at this blubbery gravy boat of a woman having a rage stroke over her soda have fun lifting your soda now
my original story is here well looks like that asshole parked in a spot in my lot that we had rented to someone else they took matters into their own hands edit i am on my phone so i have deleted the picture until i can get home and blur the plate edit picture is back up i unfortunately never got to see his reaction trust me this ruined my day more than it could possibly have ruined yours

so this actually happened something like two weeks ago but i was just told to post this here so i will first of ill clarify that im female and a bodybuilder im almost pounds by now im fairly well built in other words i noticed about minutes in that a guy was more or less following me around the gym always doing something that happened to be right next to where i was at the time he also thought i didnt notice him checking me out in the mirrors him looking i guess i can deal with whatever enjoy the view i suppose but he kept giving his buddies this look and then back at me and they just kept smiling and nodding as if theyre giving him approval or something after a while i had enough and decided to give a little back so i started going to whatever he was trying to impress me with last time adding some weight and then redoing the same set he did with the extra weight i dont even think he noticed at first but his friends did after a while of this circus of us basically walking in circles and me putting on weights on his previous machine and then outdoing him i managed to get him back into the same one twice in a row i swear to god he was oblivious to even that fact only thing was i had added almost pounds to it since he was there and done my set on it he sits down gives it a push and realizes he cant do it he tries again gets about an inch of lift and then drops again his friends burst out laughing in an embarrassed rush he pins the weight down and continues to be his impressive self but the damage was done as was i so i left when i left his friends were still laughing their asses off at him i just smiled and waved goodbye to my new gym buddy havent seen him in there since

i manage a retail store and my immediate superior is awful he was promoted based on longevity not merit or work ethic he comes in too stoned to balance a drawer avoids customer interaction at all costs even though part of his job is customer service has a holierthanthou attitude with everyone and is generally just a lazy pos anyway my day shift crew and i finished our closing work ten minutes early so i asked him to check us out so we could leave no customers in the store either he takes his sweet time walking around and checking everything and then because he didnt want to have to help any potential customers for as long as possible tells us that we have to wait ten minutes to leave earlier even though it isnt part of my closing work i had gone through all six cash registers and faced all the bills clipped the s in stacks of to make counting easier for him at the end of the night and clipped all the credit card receipts from each drawer so everything would be neat for him i had nothing to do for those last ten minutes so i went through each and every drawer unclipped the stacks and receipts and unfaced all the bills so hopefully he didnt get to leave ten minutes early either edit stupid jerk p

this is a story from when i was in th grade to provide a little background i was a nerdy kid of less than pounds with no muscle whatsoever i was frequently bullied because of this usually just verbal but sometimes more this kid named a realized that he could take my lunch and i couldnt do anything about it so that went on for a few days he had a particular taste for packaged meat products this is important after the second time he stole my lunch and i went hungry as a result i was fed up i went home took a piece of beef jerky and soaked it in daves insanity sauce for hours after sampling the meat holy shit was it spicy and i have a high tolerance for heat i brought it in to school i told my friends and classmates what was about to go down so that they could watch it happen well what do you know a came around and snatched the beef jerky out of my hands at lunch i hardly complained just told him it was a special recipe of mine he took a giant bite and started to talk about how spicy it was me telling him that was how i like it and with a big shiteating grin on my face fast forward to minutes later and a was visibly sweating face red swearing loudly about the beef jerky he was still nibbling on so he didnt look like a bitch in front of his friends he snatched my fruit snacks and applesauce ate them in front of me and then i knew i had to end this once and for all so i tried to think of a plan meanwhile a spent the rest of lunch blocking anyone else from using the water fountain in order to wash the heat from his mouth on the way back from lunch a still swearing at me i told him i knew a little trick to get the heat out i told him to just massage the corners of his eyes right near the tear ducts a spent an entire period crying into the water fountain to wash the spice out of his eyes he never stole my lunch again and neither did anyone else
a few years ago i was at my city airport about to board on a very short minute long airplane trip to another city i did the whole procedure registered my tickets sent my luggage to be wrapped and stood still in the corner now this is important i was dressed with a white tshirt and a black pair of pants looking really formal so i looked like someone from the airport staff specially because i was standing close to the airport map staring at nothing waiting for my flight i heard a commotion in the hall next to the checkin area looked there and then i saw him the asshole dude was giving everyone in the airport staff and passengers a very hard time demanding priority in the check in service and making a huge scene apparently he was too wealthy to just wait in line like everyone else he screamed so much one of the staff girls actually cried i heard he was trying to get a flight from curitiba to campinas two cities in brazil which was exactly the flight i was in so i saw an onceinalifetime opportunity to avenge the poor girl and the rest of the staff i went to the departure section and just stood still next to the place where you go to board the planes with those tubes that connect the bulding to the planes is what i mean i dont know if usa airports have this kind of stuff anyway i stood in the long corridor and when he came close to me i asked him are you sir flying to campinas or to rio de janeiro campinas he said in that disgusting voice that way i pointed to one of the tunnels entrance to my left if he made past this point in the building it meant that somebody already checked his id and ticket so nobody would question him when he got into the plane i pointed which means that he was not going to campinas actually god knows where he might have ended up if he didnt realize he was in the wrong plane tldr dude was being rude and violent in the airport redirected him to the wrong plane to teach him a lesson 
i buy and sell cars every so often i use craigslist because it is free and effective unfortunately you always get scammers in god knows what country that try to get your paypal info and scam you or mail you a fake check and get you to send the excessive amount back to themcheck bounces and you are out all the money so this is the play scammer contacts seller to buy car and promises to pay more than car is worth he says the car is going to be picked up by shipping agent check is mailed seller goes to bank and takes cash out for the amount that was over asking price seller electronically sends money to scammer check eventually bounces and seller is out a few grand with his bank car never gets picked up but you are out money in the us you legally owe the bank that money so one day i had some time on my hands and decided to play along with this scammer they always communicate via text or email there is never a credible number to call back i tried to waste his time by asking a lot of questions his method of scamming was the same as the example i gave above so pretty much you know this is shit when they want to buy a car without looking at it the car was selling for k and he was going to send k by mistake and asked i just send the k back to him cool i agree and keep in daily touch with him on the details the beauty here is that in his mind he has a pay day coming most likely he is in an impoverished county and will go a long way there if these guys get one scam every months they are doing well every day i thank him and tell him how much this will help me and my family and my special need child so he sends the check to a fake address i gave him and asks if i received it i tell him thank you so much for the check he asks that i send the money back immediately at this point it has been over weeks of us communicating i act like i have the check and tell him that i really need a new tv and if it is okay that i use the extra money for that instead he starts to get angry and demand that i send it back i keep him going for a few hours promising him that i will pay him back remember this is all over text messages eventually he loses his cool and gets nasty with me i finally apologize and say that i will send him the money he gives me the numbers i need to send it electronically and i confirm that he is at the store to pick up his money this goes on for another hour as i keep asking him to check and see if the money arrives so not only is his appetite wet he is at the store waiting on his payout i finally n tell him i knew from the beginning that he is a scammer and that i utterly enjoyed wasting his time and playing with his emotions he says you stupid piece of fuck cunt shit i laugh and blow up his phone with random texts saying how stupid he was and how smart i was petty but it felt great i know it ruined his day as he was expecting a payout for at least weeks 
preamble so a few years ago i dated this wonderful girl she was beautiful we shared tons of interests she was my best friend we were looking at apartments together the whole yards we even discussed the possibility of having kids together a major first for me the first time we celebrated her birthday i hit a home run she had lost her grandmother a few years priors to alzheimersrelated complications its a disease that runs in her family and shes horrified by it we chatted before she went to bed the night before her birthday and after she tucked in i went online and made a sizable donation to the local alzheimers fund in her name and in memory to her grandmother she called me from work happyangry the next morning because she cried at her desk when she checked her email in front of her coworkers she said it was the kindest gift shed ever received fast forward a year she ends things quite abruptly and rudely without any warning and in the months following refuses to speak to me to provide any form of closure i also learned from friends that she started living with a new boyfriend within months after we ended i was obviously devastated by this for a while but then her birthday came up i decided that i still loved the idea of donating to alzheimers even if i wasnt dating her anymore that being said ive still done the donation in her name for the past years and shes gotten the email every year since edit i dont include her grandmother in the new donations that would be cruel 
ive been reading this subreddit since it started and its definitely become one of my favorites so im glad to finally contribute i apologize if its a bit long background during college i was in a longdistance relationship with my girlfriend mary now my wife we went to neighboring state schools which meant a lot of hour drives back and forth most weekends on this particular weekend mary discovered that her friend jess was also planning on visiting my school they only lived about minutes apart from each other so it made sense to carpool for the long ride up jess offered to use her car if mary would drive them up there with the condition that jess would drive mary home on the way back since its a college town parking was at a premium and free parking was even harder to find luckily some of my friends had a free lot on the outskirts of town since were all doing each other favors i offered to park jess car there and save everyone some money i met them both when they arrived friday afternoon jess went to hang out with her friends and i parked her car in the free lot i should mention that its a very large town and it was easily a minute walk from jess friends apartment to the free lot that is if you know where the free lot is located anyway we had an awesome weekend and sunday rolls around meaning its time for jess and mary to go home i was engaged in an allday student club event when i got a phone call from mary stating the following jess had decided that she didnt have time to drop mary off at home anymore and that she would leave mary several towns over at which point mary should call another friend to take her the rest of the way oh and can i go get jess her car and bring it to her since i still had her keys oh hell no i was pissed and i was certainly not going to let jess strand my girlfriend in an unfamiliar place with no means to get home mary was upset and didnt really know what to do since jess was being a selfish bitch it was at this point that i realized the only way i could guarantee for mary to get home was to make the long drive there myself to drop her off so i left my event leaving my understanding friends shorthanded and went to meet that bitch jess the revenge i told jess sure come to my apartment and ill take care of you she arrived expecting her car and was handed only keys i pointed her in the direction of the lot walked to my car and started driving mary home the thing is the free lot was in an obscure and far away part of town it took me minutes to walk there moving at a relatively fast pace and knowing exactly where i was going jess was still calling me hours later trying to find her car from my intentionally vague directions mary was half way home before jess even started her trip i hope she grasped the irony that by trying to save minutes and screwing over my girlfriend she ended up losing hours of her time but thats probably giving her too much credit tldr my girlfriends friend was willing to strand my girlfriend to save herself a half hour she completely went back on everything she promised after taking advantage of our kindness so i cost her hours of her time and a lot of stress
not sure if this belongs here but i have to share dear jerkhole regular customer at my minimum wage fast food restaurant you became our mayor in the last election not like its a crazy important position in a town with people but still its obvious that you were very very proud of it you acted like it was such a privilege for me and my coworkers to give you your coffee every morning and then of course you had to have your exact number of equal packets and cream cups but you had to put them in yourself because those making minimum wage arent capable of that on top of the fact that you look down on us honestly its whatever im used to it you leave your condiment garbage right there on the front counter where we serve the other customers or like that one time when our computers were down so we couldnt take anybodys order you demanded that we ring you up the old fashioned way with paper and pencil because you had to get your fill of mcbeetus steak bagel well done no sauce you sir are a jerk but im happy now wanna know why our town just had the mayor elections and you lost by votes do you know how many votes that is thats stepped on minimum wage workers and of my friendsclassmates that i had told how much of a jerk you are i havent seen you since before the election but im willing to bet your step has lost some of its pep enjoy your nasty cheap coffee mr exmayor jerk wow wasnt expecting any attention thank you everybody and thank you random stranger for the gold wow

i was a waitress in a bar and grill that catered to a lot of farmers and their wives big farms big money pretentious women one woman was a regular that always came in with some of her other wealthy friends and they all ordered the same thing everytime i had their orders memorized and would have their drinks waiting when they say down they were usually nice but she was always rude one day she was being extra snippy with me and made a comment about how i should be home with my child instead of hanging out in a bar i noticed her drink was running low and i politely asked her if she would like some more she just scoffed and pushed it towards me i smiled and in my sweetest voice possible asked diet coke right she looked appalled and said regular coke i just said oh looked her up and down and walked away refilling her drink i may have lost my tip that day but it was worth it just to exact this bit of petty revenge hitting her right in the self esteem 
one job i do is occasionally supplying the audiovisual stuff for corporate conferences which essentially means i mic up speakers and babysit their powerpoint presentations while they present in front of a room full of ceos doctors military personnel etc this one guy i had to mic up very recently was incredibly short tempered and snappy with me for no real reason other than he was nervous im fine with that im used to dealing with rude people i actually take a weird satisfaction in turning them around and turning them into happy and calm people by reassuring them and generally doing a good job but this guy was different he was a fat bloke with bright pink skin as a result of his high blood pressure he waddled over to my desk at the back of the room breathing heavily with his hand outstretched and barked give me a microphone i wasnt gonna like this guy i calmly smiled and said no problem as i stood to mic him up i said give me a microphone now oops this guy can go fuck himself so i mic him up assure him his presentation is ready when he interrupts me and says i want you to turn me up really loud i think if we turn up the pa anymore it might be a little uncomfortable for the audien i wasnt asking your opinion i was telling you to turn me up i just looked at him unconsciously giving him a death stare i work for myself so i dont give a fuck you pink grenade he walks up to the lectern as he is introduced i turn him up on the mixer as loud as it can go without feedback looking at his perfectlypunch able oval face when something amazing happens he covers his mouth as he lets out a small cough and as he does so he does the wettest dribblyest sounding fart ive ever heard and because the microphone was turned up so loud it was amplified x and straight into the ears and brains of everyone in the entire room silence he stands baffled at how his entire life has led him to this moment he turns even redder and his voice begins to shake speaking of shaking my whole body is trembling trying to keep my explosive laughter unseen beneath the surface at the end he walked all the way to the back of the room shamed and sheepishly thanked me oh the sweetness of his shame i can still taste it

so i work at the deli in my local grocery store and i get more than a fair deal of shitty customers ive noticed a lot of the time the worst ones are suburban soccer moms with spoiled little kids they would always do dumb shit like if they wanted half a pound and it came as theyd ask for a discount or outright flip shit ive been at my job long enough to essentially sense these people come in and when i do the game begins my deli offers free samples on anything the customer wants and me being a good guy make sure people are aware of that well it turns out of soccer moms actually do not want free samples for their kids so i make a strong point of asking the child directly if they want free meatcheesesalad to which of the time the answer is yes this starts an argument between spoiled kids and snobby parents and they usually leave my counter and dont return i know this isnt half as good as some of these other stories but this one is harmless and actually pretty fun
i posted this in a small blurb somewhere else i had forgotten all about it i thought id write it up about years ago a bunch of coworkers and i got together for a night of bowling and drinking i was so i was sober around pm i decided to call it a night this particular alley was about the only hang out for teens in the area and on weekend nights starting at they had teen night for unlimited bowling shoes and drinks so a lot of kids went there and if you wanted a lane you got there early so the parking lot became the preparty especially when the nights were nice anyway im going out to my car on this warm evening to find half a dozen teens sitting on or leaning heavily on peoples cars one of my pet peeves but not my car and i have no proof its not theirs either until i look at my car the hood of my new car it was a used car with previous old lady owner we called it the cream puff a honda civic not fancy but in perfect shape and only years old there was a boy and a girl on it not just sitting on my hood mind you but full on making out he was laying on the windshield and she was straddling him dry humping and all now i wasnt that much older than them i get hormones and such but you dont just dry fuck on a car that doesnt belong to you so i did what any responsible adult would do i turned around and got everyone who was around me to come watch i grabbed a couple friends this grabbed the crowd of teens attention who started watching what i was doing then i pushed the panic button on the alarm they started swearing he jumped up knocking her to her ass onto the gravel he rolled over and landed in a bush they yelled a bit about what the fuck but eventually they took off i cant imagine he got anymore play that night his ego and her ass were probably too bruised tldr make out on my hood ill make you eat pavement

so i was working a shift with my boss when this lady comes in she orders ice cream cones and i make them while my boss rings her up now when i made it there was probably a oz difference between them however they were both probably or oz above the normal so when i give them to the lady she starts throwing a fit about how one is bigger than the other and how we were trying to rip her off so my boss tells her with a concerned voice that he would be happy to remake them properly with a stern look in my direction and she accepts also while giving me a dirty look so my boss throws out the originals and makes cones both oz exactly about the size of the originals he gives them to her while she stares with disbelief and starts arguing with him he pulled out the training guide and shows her exactly where it says oz on a small cone she took her cones and walked out then as soon as she left me and my boss started laughing our asses off
ive been reading this sub for a while now its become one of my favorites so i thought id submit my first post i had the same roommate for two years of oncampus housing at college we were good friends and still are though as with any roommate there were always small things that bugged each of us about the other simple things one ought to let go my roommate lets call him nj was an awfully friendly guy but had a bad habit of eating things that did not belong to him without asking or ever acknowledging the fact that he ate them i found this very rude and after bringing it up on several occasions i realized that he had no plan to stop for he was one of those share everything types nj was a social butterfly easily peer pressured and thus always ready to get supremely drunk and go party on any and all given nights one night i came home to find my whatwouldhavebeen munchies were gone the wrapper for which was in the trash he was out drinking heavily as always and i knew he would come home wasted and fall right asleep in this i found the outlet for my petty revenge the small annoyances he caused me of having to walk back to the convenience store or wherever to replace the snacks were only so annoying because they were constant so my revenge must be a constant small annoyance as well with that in mind i stuffed his pillowcase full of magazines and hid all bedding in his closet aside from a small blanket he came stumbling home a few hours later and as i predicted fell right asleep he didnt notice his bricklike pillow at all nj woke up the next day cold with a sore neck wondering why the fuck his pillowcase was stuffed with magazines and where all his sheets were i told him that he came home ranting about pillows or something and that he was shifting all his books around as i was trying to sleep making a lot of noise by his closet too for the next few months i did this every time he went out drinking effectively convincing him that he had a drunken habit of replacing his pillow with magazines and hiding all his bedding the laugh it gave me made the short walks to the convenience store for snacks worth it edit im glad you are all enjoying my first story to clear a couple things up he never found out and i have no intention of telling him also we shared a room twin xl beds with one minifridge we didnt have separate rooms which is why hiding food was not really an option edit i decided to write down another petty revenge story about living with nj it is
i was at my parents house last night when my mom answered a call on their landline i perked up when i heard her say with a worried look on her face my computers infected i knew immediately this was a scam call so i told her id handle it and took the phone it was a guy from india in a call center saying he was with microsoft and i needed to follow his stepbystep instructions to clean up all the viruses on our pc ie give him remote control steal whatever info they can get install malware turn it into a zombie or whatever else they do with this scam now i hate scammers with a passion but im especially pissed off because my mom is getting up there in age and isnt as sharp as she used to be and wouldve fallen for this had i not been there in fact she did fall for this exact same scam about a year ago i had to wipe the computer and told her very plainly that no one will ever ever call from microsoft or for any other internet related issue unfortunately her memory isnt so hot these days in a very thick indian accent this guy tells me how bad the computer is with all its viruses and infections oh no really i have viruses how do i fix it i say he assures me hell walk me through the clean up process and i express my relief and gratitude sweet i dont have shit to do at the moment ok sir i need you to hold down the windows key and the r key at the same time ok i did that now what do you see my computer is off now sir no why is your computer off you should see a menu please power the computer back on i actually had turned it off so i would be able to blare the windows logon sound to make it convincing now this is like an pc my mom has so the start up time is not exactly fast so after a good while i tell him im back up and ready ok sir now look at the keyboard and find the windows key and the r key please hold these down at the same time now please tell me sir what do you see hmm my computer turned off again i held down the main windows button and the r key just like you told me and it turned off again im sorry i just dont know what im doing wrong hes getting a little frustrated now but the beauty is im thinking this guy probably has to call hundreds of people before hes got a sucker on the line as willing and eager as i am to remedy this particular computer problem so i do this cycle a full four times each time giving him more little hints that i think the windows key is actually the power button by the fourth time i thought for sure he would get it because i was calling it something like the main windows power button on my dell but sadly he never did figure it out he gives up on that and moves on to try something else ok sir forget that we will try something else he goes on to explain that were going to do a bootup sequence where i have to press the f key while the computer is booting back up obviously this could not have worked out better the chance to continually miss hitting the f key in time has me absolutely giddy inside i assure him im ready to hit the key and restart the machine i let it fully boot up and blare the windows login sound again and say ok its back on and im hitting the key now he sighs with more frustration you have to do it while the computer is starting back up he explains so i apologize again and feign frustration myself while holding back my unfettered delight the next round he is more careful to make sure im hitting the key during the bootup sequence so im punching away on the space bar key as loud as i can during the bootup and after a couple minutes or so here comes that beautiful windows start up sound again and he lets out an even louder more frustrated sigh sir did you hit the f key well ive gone this far i think to myself i may as well lay on another level of frustration by insulting his english yes i was hitting the s and h keys the whole time i dont know what went wrong yep that did it no no no the f key the f key sir look at your keyboard do you see the f key ohohthe f key i say yes i see ill try again we sit there waiting a few more minutes i repeat the whole process this time after the startup sound i tell him i hit the f and keys but again nothing happened holy shit hes fuming at this point but trying as hard as he can to hold it back right then i heard my mom call that dinner was ready normally i would have blown off dinner for something this much fun but wed grilled out these beautiful ribeyes and i wasnt about to let mine get cold i tell him im really sorry i have to go to dinner now and i will have to fix it later and with that after this minute phone call i just hang up i sit at the table admiring this beautifully marbled steak and tell my folks it was all a scam and i was just wasting his time the phone rings my mom jumps up and says i got it in the sweetest voice my mom said im really sorry but we are having family dinner at the moment and i have a rule that everyone has to sit down together and after a moment listening to his reply she hangs up and sits back down whatd he say i ask mom replies he said fuck your family dinner 
my neighbors installed a sprinkler system which they run for minutes per zone and it hits my yard during the installation process their cheap ass company poke a hole in our system they also ran a drain from their downspout into our yard literally we had a pvc pipe going from their downspout into our grass our side has basically been flood since we cant use our sprinklers they wont admit they broke ours and wont address the rain off after watching them water my mud spot for like months i said fuck it i built a x garden bed and filled it with manure the smelliest most organic maneur i could find they live downwind of us and watched them have to smell it the whole weekend on their brand new patio escape they just refinished i built it right in the edge of the property line this morning rather than watch them water my mud trench they watered my vegetable garden thanks for the free water bitches and fuck no you arent getting any of my tomatoes
so it turns out my exgirlfriend is a cheating whore but were still living together for the time being until the lease is up or we find some way out of it in any case the duration of our time living together will be filled with small acts of revenge i no longer put the toilet seat down those towels that are only for decoration not anymore but i think the consequences of her actions really started to settle in after the following exchange umm were going to have to take my car to the shop we and then i went back to playing words with friends
i inherited a small bungalow home in central florida it wasnt much but it was home the neighbors house were close on all sides which normally wasnt an issue a house next to the bedroom side of me was rented out to a young group of people who occasionally had loud late night parties to me this wasnt a problem as i worked nights for the other neighbors it was a nightmare the group would always seem to turn the music off before the cops would arrive threaten violence or vandalism to people if they would walk over to complain etc i was trying to stay out of the drama until one of the punks got a new system for his car the bass would literally shake my walls i tried to be civil and even asked politely for him to wait at least until i was awake around pm to rattle the few brain cells he had left into oblivion he blatantly refused and im pretty sure he did it more often to piss me off so i did what the other neighbors had neglected to do i got on the tax collectors website found out who owned the house it was owned by an elderly couple in massachusetts where im from after talking to them and gathering complaints form the others who had been harassed the landlords had enough and sent them a notice to vacate which they ignored i ended up being appointed volunteer property manager and escorted a police officer to hand delivering the eviction notice to them the look on their face was priceless 
this revenge wasnt performed by me but it was done for me background the local noodle bar has an offer where you can claim a free noodle box on your birthday and you can claim it days on either side of your birthday and me and my sister went to claim it since my birthday was days ago situation we were waiting in the line for around minutes since it was quite long and they only had server and when we were finally next up to order some random guy from now known as butt just decides to barge infront of us and start ordering revenge the guy starts getting his order cashier confirming the order and making sure he got the prices right once butt had comfirmed that he had it right the cashier told him ok sir now go to the back of the line and dont cut in line again and he was furious and went to the back of the line we were the only ones in line by then so he went behind us the cashier and my sister and i laughed it out and he upgraded the free box from small to large we tipped him still even though the box was completely free while we were walking out of the store we saw the cashier screwing with butt even more by acting as he had just met him and was making butt say everything again tldr random guy cut in line cashier made him order twice making him say every detail
on mobile sorry for anything weird also kinda wordy mostly a spectator to this one but still helped out at my high school grades there is a little area in one of the parking lots for busses and for parents to pick up and drop off kids although waiting there for any period of time is not allowed unfortunately lots of parents cant bear to see their poor little children walk through the parking lot so they will wait in this spot for anywhere up to to minutes so one day im in the bus after a volleyball game and we pull into the parking lot there are cars in the drop off area and it needs to be completely clear for the bus to fit in third car drives away and kids are getting into first car second car with no kid to be seen turns off car and sits and waits our bus driver honks once and the driver just sits there honks again driver looks over then looks back forward honks for seconds straight at this point the driver gets out of his car and walks away so the bus driver pulls up a little more making it so the second car cant move until the first one leaves we start getting off and the driver comes back with his daughter and waits angrily for the first car to leave eventually it does but now driver cant leave because we are walking in front of him so he hits his horn and holds it i see my opportunity and make sure i am the last one off the bus as i get off whoops dropped my bag and oh my shoes look kinda loose better retie them oh did i leave something i thought for a few seconds no i finally walk off the driver finally lets up on the horn and angrily drives off asshole edit clarified a few things
we stopped for some fish and chips at a great little stand in brockville and parked where we could look out at the river a mid s woman in an acura whips into adjacent parking spot opens her door hard into my door and does not say whoops sorry or even kiss my arse she did not even make eye contact with me sitting there in the passenger seat with the window open she simply locked her car and hurried off i stewed about this for a minute or so while enjoying my fries the gulls were gathering in numbers as i had tossed a few chips out for them and then i noticed she had left her sunroof open i tossed a chip and scored points directly into the acura the gulls showed interest so i tossed another one brave gull dropped right down into the car to get the chips i kept tossing chips and managed to get gulls squabbling inside her car at this point my wife got mad at me and drove off spoiling my revenge
i live in a decent area that is situated a bit out into the country i know most of my neighbors within a mile by name and we all help each other out all the time this includes lending gasoline i had filled up the day before gas station is miles from the house and has competitive prices so i knew my tank was supposed to show full i come out to leave for work and turn the car on like normal and watch the gas gauge rise on back uphalf way ok no big deal parents might have borrowed some i can ask them when i get home they say no they didnt and offer to let me fill up from the gas cans we keep filled and stored for whatever we might need it for i top my tank back off with this welcome help and go on in for the night the next morning crank up the car and a tank something fishy is up asked my nearest neighbors if perhaps they had siphoned my tank for an emergency its happened before so figured perhaps that was the explanation nope no one had done so i figured i could only conclude there was some one stealing my gas time to fix that i go on to the gas station and fill up my tank again i also fill a gallon jug most of the way with diesel then top off the jug with gasoline the combine mixture now for all intents and purposes appears and smells like gasoline i head on home and set up a pipe with a cap and sink it on into my gas tank then take it out to be sure there were no leaks seeping into the pipe i put the pipe back in and anchor it inside my tanks receiving tube the portion leading down into the gas tank from the cap and fill it with the gasolinediesel close my cap and go on in for the night come out the next morning to find my neighbors boyfriend across the street in a panic i check the pipe on my car and sure enough drained dry their car would no longer crank as they had poured their stolen goods into the tank diesel gas car nope

a couple of months ago my truck engine blew and i had to find a new car in a hurry there is a dealership within a mile of me so i had someone take me to it the salesman was really nice and friendly and before long he had me convinced to actually get a more expensive car than i had originally planned and he let me drive it as a loaner while he contacted the financing companies i had originally planned on spending k the car he was trying to get me in was k lo and behold he couldnt get me financed for the more expensive car but there were pieces of shit that he could get me in for my original k now this was a dealership that had five more stores in the city so i looked online and saw an awesome nissan murano in great condition with low miles for that same k i asked him if they could get it from the other store from me and he goes welllllllllllllllthat would be an additional for us to transfer it from their inventory to ours and these two cars are very similar they werent and blah blah blah bullshit bullshit bullshit so i hatched my plan i told him to give me an hour to think it over and i would be back if i decided to buy one of the cars then great and if not i would bring back his loaner then instead i drove the minutes to the other store in his loaner car and made the deal for the murano myself as i was wrapping up the deal i asked the gm to call the original store and tell them that he was going to send their loaner back to them it was so sweet listening as the original salesman got pissed off and threatened to have me arrested the gm told him direct quote gordon cut the bullshit and put your gm on the line you didnt want to make the deal and we did i have your car on my lot and am getting one of my guys to bring it back tomorrow morning so quit being an asshole while i talk to your boss damn that felt good

my family didnt have a lot of money so right after i graduated from high school i got a job waiting tables to help pay for community college i was lucky enough to get a job as a server at the local houlihans and it was pretty good money for young college kid in the back there were these two mexican dishwashers who were also joking around and laughing they spoke very broken english but were able to communicate every time they would see me they greeted me with a spanish sounding version of my name i didnt really understand it but they always laughed and seemed genuinely happy to see me so i laughed along too after several months working there one of the cooks working the line who always had a front row seat to this suddenly called me over i remember this guy was always stoic and we werent really friends but we werent on bad terms either i always did my job and tried to keep as much shit from angry customers from coming back to the kitchen which is probably why he took pity on me he said do you know what they are calling you i shook my head no i had no idea it is a joke on your name it basically means take out and suck your dick i thanked him profusely and after that i tried to go even more out of my way to help that guy at the same time a smouldering fire began to rage and burn in my heart i was humiliated and angry but i didnt say anything to them i just smiled and played the game i immediately enrolled in spanish classes the next semester i found spanish speaking students to hang out with soon my entire group of friends was spanish speaking by this time i had moved on from that restaurant and left those two dishwashers behind but they were not forgotten after several more semesters i started spending my summer breaks volunteering in south america and finally as i graduated from university with a degree in engineering i won an internship to work in spain only because i had become so good at speaking spanish it was an amazing three months but all good things come to an end and i had return home after i came back home i was exhausted but my friend forced me to go to a birthday party by coincidence i ended up meeting an amazing hispanic woman there who was going to be my future wife later that night we all went to a club and as we were dancing and having a good time i suddenly felt someone tapping me on the shoulder i turned around and standing there is oscar one of the dish washers take out your dick and suck it he said in spanish without missing a beat i replied in perfect spanish your sister already did that for me last night his eyes got really big and then we both burst into laughter and hugged the petty dream i originally had to get back at him had finally been fulfilled but now years later my heart was suddenly filled with gratitude i had long since realized that he had unknowingly launched me into an amazing journey where i travelled the world met some amazing people fell in love with a new culture and had just met my future wife so fuck you oscar and thanks again
ok last week i was at this sort of wedding lunch except it was my parents anniversary anyway a lot of food and stuff but because of problems with assigned seats i ended up with yo spoiled kid that i cant stand its the son of my sisters husbands sister im not good with these things bare with me so the little shit was being annoying during the whole meal but i kept calm now for the important part you have to know that i love shrimps but since it was a big lunch with a lot of appetizers every dish had just a few things in it i had been there since am and it was pm the shrimps arrived and god what a beautiful vision for my eyes i could already taste all that goodness except there was only one shrimp perperson well no big deal each one eats his own shrimp and i was saving it for last since there was other stuff in the plate that i ate first now the little shit goes i want more shrimps and everyone says well little shit there was only one perplate and you ate yours then you know whats about to happen yes little shit looks at me like the solution was obvious all along neokratosred still has one ok now my brain took a few seconds to realize what was happening everyone was staring at me and everyone expected me to do what everyone would have done no way kid you sat at the wrong fucking table i waited almost six hours for this damn shrimp and youre not getting any more of it expecially since you ate yours already and youre a little shit so i opened the shrimp with my fork and knife carefully cleaned it took my fork slowly raising the readytobeeaten shrimp in the air then without saying a word i looked little shit right in the fucking eyes and ate the whole thing in one motion slowly chewing it in his face nobody said a word not even little shit it was probably the first time he couldnt get something because of his crying and because of the fact that he was a kid everyone silently resumed eating and even though they didnt say anything i am pretty sure they were quite mad at me and this little stunt probably came with a oneway ticket to hell 
my ex cheated with a married man he now lives with her he is a pos but anyway i still have login for her dvr i logged in erased all her shows then recorded only the show cheaters petty but it makes me laugh edit additional info i also set the show to be manually erased and stop recording hours after the shows end time 
this was a few years ago and i have to admit that it was largely accidental but it was satisfying none the less i was on my way home when this guy in a lowered bright orange car with a huge chrome muffler sticking out from under the back bumper hid lights and a very badly fitted body kit started tailgating me i had seen the guy coming for a while in my mirrors going from lane to lane cutting people off and in general driving like a jerk he was in front of me at one point but when his lane slowed down he fell behind the next thing i know he comes buzzing up behind me with those blinding bright blue headlights right in my mirrors he gets so close theres just this aura of light behind me traffic is heavy and i couldnt get out of his way if i wanted to it was at this point i see a commotion among the cars in front of me they are merging into any opening possible then i see it there is a square bale of hay laying in the road that must have fallen off some farmers truck i dont really have anywhere to go and the idiot inches off my back bumper makes it a bad idea to stand on the brakes thats when it dawns on me that im in a ton truck with miles on it that looks like it barely survived a war im not worried about what little damage a small bale of hay might do i never touched the brakes i feel it hit a couple of times under the truck but its not bad this is followed instantly by a loud whumpcrack noise the buzzing behind me changes pitch and those super bright headlights immediately start falling behind they stay back eventually he was able to pass and as he went by i could see that part of the the body kit under the front bumper was now missing tldr tailgater in a lowered car gets a surprise when i run over something in the road with my truck with lots of ground clearance edited to add tldr 
my first year away for college i lived in a fairly standard triple room with two women shelly and kelly no joke we had been chatting it up on myspace in the weeks before we moved in together just regular getting to know you stuff our dorm like most dorms had an uncomfortable tile covered concrete floor the university sold large rolls of carpeting for around and shellys parents had offered to buy it and were wondering if we would be interested in chipping in the way this question was posed to me it seemed optional being an incredibly broke college student was a lot of money i explained my situation shelly understood or so i thought and we were all good when we moved in together it became apparently very quickly that shelly and i were not going to be the best of friends there was an escalating series of passive aggressive moves like her constant need for the room to be f so cold and yelling at me for messing with the window unit she slept above me in the bunks so there were many passive aggressive remarks about how she wanted the bottom bunk or how my desk was too cluttered for her to use as a ladder use the goddamn ladder shelly once before thanksgiving break shelly came home while i was packing my duffel was on the floor beside our bed and as she was climbing her drunk ass up to her bunk she rolled off and straight onto my duffel bag which kept her from getting seriously injured when i asked her if she was okay and if i could get her anything she glared at me and said i hate you so much dead serious this is what i had been dealing with since we moved in together sometime around moms weekend march shelly decided that she needed me to pay my share of the carpet i reminded her of our agreement from the beginning of the year and that even though i was working all my money went toward books food etc i didnt really have the expendable income and she knew that she didnt care she wanted to the money and when that didnt work she changed her story to say that her parents wanted the money i knew better shelly wanted weed money im a casual smoker but i absolutely didnt want her skunky shit in the dorm because i didnt want to risk getting in trouble and i knew shed throw me under the bus if she got caught this was a thursday so not wanting to fight her anymore i just told her id pay her when i got paid the next day the next day i came home from work and was settling in for the night when in walks kelly and her mom and shelly and her mom and thats when it hit me i could call shellys bluff and have this whole thing blow up in her face right then and there i wrote the check to shellys mom as i was handing it to her she looked at me a little puzzled i explained that shelly mentioned that they needed my portion of the payment for the carpeting and i was so sorry the payment was so late but i was basically paycheck to paycheck because of school her mother looked shocked what did she do she glanced at shelly glared now i could see where she got it immediately knew what had happened and then smiled at me and said thank you thats very sweet but we understood going in that you werent able to cover the carpet you can void that check shelly did not speak to me the rest of the year i did get to see that glare a lot though 
this morning i was walking between terminals in the minneapolis airport a bunch of us got stuck behind a group of teenage girls slowly walking side by side side by side deep i fly over times a year but id never seen anything like this a human traffic jam caused by oblivious idiots obliviots more than two dozen people and an airport cart driving an elderly woman frustratedly walked behind them they ignored peoples polite requests of excuse me angry pleas of i have a flight to catch and even the beeping of the cart and this was not a mall or a park this was an airport where delaying someone else by even a minute can destroy their day meanwhile they loudly gabbed about what cute boys they liked as if sticking to script from an archie comic while they physically blocked the entire hallway they were emotionally twodimensional finally the hall widened enough for us to walk around them i hung back and let everyone else go ahead of me as i had some leeway before my connecting flight as the mess cleared i walked by the gaggle then stopped in front of them turned around and said i think its wonderful that there are still teenage girls willing to hang out with a friend who is clearly so much uglier than the rest of the group and then i kept walking i didnt even get to the end of the hall before i heard them fighting about who i meant for the sake of the people on whatever flight theyre eventually on i hope theyre now giving each other the silent treatment tldr you want to ruin peoples days i will ruin your entire vacation and perhaps the rest of high school
i am a fulltime server and fulltime college student have you ever worked in a restaurant valentines day is the busiest day of the year for service workers it is the battle of normandy dday the holiday of holidays everyone goes out and because of this we all have to work a little bit harder because this is when we make our money the restaurant i work at is right next to a movie theater shades of grey came out yesterday its not a particularly fancy place and its largely dependent on the cinema crowd i spent most of last night serving horny single women in their earlymid thirties going out with their girlfriends one of these groups of women ran me absolutely ragged i am a hard worker friendly and outgoing on the floor and extremely accomodating to my guests i answered questions about cocktails let them taste different cocktails coursed out this tables meal in a very odd way and accommodated a number of unusual requests this table stayed for two hours and weeded me for about half of that everything according to them was great when all was said and done i dropped their check and they left cash on a bill they tipped me roughly on a holiday no less this morning i was nursing my vday singles red wine hangover with a breakfast sandwich at a local cafe the population of this city is only you dont know everyones business but i see the same crowd the same places and guess who sat next to me with a business client this morning the nasty woman who ran me ragged last night and felt it right to practically stiff me on her large bill i stared at her until she made eye contact with me do i know you she says grinning yes last night you came to eat with your girlfriends at the restaurant i work at and left me a tip do you remember doing that her smile faded as did her clients he looked at me and then back at her and then back at me i gave her a super salty sarcastic smile and an eyebrow raise and went back to my school work her potential client was not pleased but thats what you get for being a shitty tipper tldr took advantage of the opportunity of a lifetime by confronting a very bad tipper and potentially ruined a business relationship 
im pretty sure this may be as petty as it could get semirelevant background my high school was terrible it was way out in the cracked up redneck woods camo attire everywhere and my graduation class was merely kids despite how tiny we were the school poured all of its funding into its football team which left everything else desperately trashy pathetically underfunded and in disrepair this also included the buses having an unbalanced ratio to the number of kids as a result almost every bus was sitting three kids to a seat and a handful sitting in the aisle a few parents sent in complaints but for the most part no one wanted to give up their football funding to provide enough busesto hell with safety regulations on my bus there was this one cheerleaderwho hit every hollywood stereotype rude snobbish thinks shes a queen kind of dumb ect every single day being one of the first stops she grabbed a seat and plopped down her duffel bag next to her and snapped at anyone who dared to ask her to let them sit i was pretty annoyed about it and the annoyance grew little by little every day until one day she screamed at my younger sister her seat was the very last one every other had three kids with two kids already in the aisle id finally had enough of this sowithout saying anything i walked to her seat and sat on her nothing really violent but it shocked her nonetheless i wasnt a big teenager by any means but she was very very tiny so it had to be uncomfortable she scrambled over to the window i stood up told my sister she could sit down and sat in the aisle every time the bus came to our stop after that i would see her quickly shove her duffel bag under the seat and scoot to the window edit theres a little bit of confusion but im female btw 
not quite petty but this girl lets call her r is a coworker of mine at a local grocery store one day at work r asks me to buy her cigarettes from our work im shes i tell her i wont and after a few more questions she drops the subject later that day i am called into my managers office and he is furious because r told him that i had offered to buy her cigarettes he threatens to fire me over this but gives me one final chance because ive been a model employee although he believes im lying to him when i tell him the true version of the story now r is a very flirty touchy person she is always giving hugs and touching the other male employees i was never bothered by it but after this incident i decided her touching was making an uncomfortable work environment for me i began to keep a detailed record of each time she touched me and told her each time that i wasnt comfortable with her doing it each time i said it loud enough so another employee could hear and asked them to sign my record thereby affirming my story weeks go by and i mention something to our stores hr person telling them r was making me uncomfortable r is given a warning but after a couple days the touching continues as does my recording more weeks go by and a similar complaint is made by me to our hr person r is given a second warning but ignores it and continues to touch me mainly because she knows that im made uncomfortable by it and she thinks that is funny finally after months i go to the hr person and show them the physical list i have made of each time r has touched me including my fellow coworkers signatures telling how they can back up my claim the hr person immediately calls r into the hr office and fires her on the spot for repeated sexual harassment of fellow employees the look of shocksurprise on her face made it all worthwhile especially when she looked over and saw the knowing smirk on my face tldr coworker asks me to buy her cigarettes illegally and almost gets me fired i get her fired for sexual harassment edit r was the niece of the manager he pulled strings for her to be hired and that is why he took her side over mine

every morning i sit in traffic for an hour to get to work i have very sensitive eyes when i first wake up and am very sleepy a truck decided to hang out just close enough to the butt of my car so that his led headlights were reflecting off of my rear view mirror and side mirrors directly into my eyeballs this wasnt the first time i know it wont be the last i was hung over so it just added to the irritation there was no reason for this person to be so close to my behind i moved the rear view mirror so it wasnt blinding me but alas the side mirror was still unbearable cue the evil plot i spent the next minutes of touch and go traffic redirecting the beam of deathlight directly back in his face when i finally got it positioned properly his entire cabin lit up he kept blocking his eyes in horror i laughed maniacally as he backed away and kept his distance tldr truck headlights were too bright behind me so i used my magical mirror powers to blind him instead

 this just happened working construction at a small university with a lot of snobbish entitled students were remodeling the kitchen which has a maintenance entrance that students arent supposed to use but do anyway because its a shortcut to the dining hall today were painting the doors and door frames so we really need people not to walk through so they dont touch anything or track paint drippings all over the carpet were painting the inside of the door and in comes entitled bitch she demands through the knob hole that we stop what were doing and open the door for her so she can get up to the dining hall seconds faster than going around i tell her politely that this entrance is closed for a few hours because of the wet paint she informs me that were not allowed to block a fire exit at this point put down my roller open the door and tell her that this is not a fire exit and point to the authorized personnel only sign next to the door this bitch totally ignores me and tries to squeeze her considerable girth past me anyway still yelling something about fire exits of course the entire side of her body got covered in paint when she brushed up against the door frame best part is she didnt even notice as she walked away i had to repaint the spot but its a small price to pay for knowing that shell be stuck to a dining hall chair in a few minutes 
so i work at a frozen yogurt store one of those selfserve places where you make your own and weigh it its an easy job and aside from some occasional bullshit from upper management its also generally pleasant i also happen to live in a fairly wealthy area and the vast majority of my customers are very wealthy folks and while of them are awesome wonderful people there are always bad apples slightly rude or short with me is one thing but once in a while we get a customer in who is well and truly an entitled monster and on those occasions i wish for nothing more than the power to set people on fire with only my furious gaze this young lady was one of those people the offense its about pm and its a busy day ive been cutting up fresh fruit for the fridge and now im bringing it out for the customers to use entitled princesshereafter known as ep and her friend both would be about are getting their yogurt and as im passing them ep accidentally knocks a chair into me causing me to fall and spill about containers of mango all over the floor i take a deep breath and ask the customers to please not walk on it while i grab a cloth and a cup to put the floormango into and eps friend immediately begins to help me getting on the floor and scooping it into a pile ep leans down laughs and tugs friend to her feet announcing loudly ewwww laura dont help her thats what they pay her for as she purposefully stomps all over the fruit on her way to the cash making an already huge mess about x worse friend begins to protest but ep is clearly queen bee and she relents giving me apologetic eyes as they pay and leave ep also made sure to run the yogurt all over the place while making hers so the machines are also really messy and gross now the revenge so about minutes after theyve left the store has gotten quiet im going around doing some busywork cleaning chairs and tables and doing a quick mop when all of a sudden i notice a wallet lying beside the scale by the register as is our policy i open it up to look for idso that when they return i can verify that the wallet does indeed belong to them and lo and behold the wallet appears to belong to ep but then looking closer i notice two drivers licenses i pull them out thinking maybe its the nice friends wallet insteadand in that case i would have slipped a bunch of dollar off coupons inside but no both have pictures of ep one has a name and birthdate matching her health cardthat says shes and the other has a totally different name and birthdatethat says shes newly edited to add i live in ontario canada where the drinking age is it dawns on me that its a fake id and i chuckle to myself before putting the wallet away to return when she comes back untouched im not the kind of person to risk my job to steal from a forgotten wallet even if the owner sucks but then it happens about two hours after the wallet was found ep returns with her spraytanned blindingteethknashing hairhelmeted and poloshirt wearing dad in tow both in a snit and clearly expecting the wallet to have mysteriously disappeared dad marches up while ep stands behind smirking at me and declares that his precious daughter left hervery expensive lv in fact wallet here and that she absolutely must have it back this very moment well this is like christmas morning for me because i realise that i get to completely shit all over eps day i pull out the wallet and ask is this the wallet you left to which she snappily responds that it is while jumping in front of dad and trying to yank it from my hand i pull it back open it up and say very calmly and with a poker face can i get the name and birthdate on the id dad rolls his eyes like a dying cow and barks oh for gods sake first name last name and actual birthday to which i respond fake id in hand thats not the information i have here right before i swiftly reach over eps grasping fingers and hand the id to dad theres a moment of horrible fantastic silence while dad takes in the id in his hand about seconds later i break the tension by pulling out the real license and saying ooooh silly me here it is that other one must be old or something giving ep my best fake grin and holding out her wallet for her to take ep reaches out to take it but dad leans over and snatches it from me shooting her a look that could peel paint and snapping ep we will talk about this in the car my boss almost wet herself when i told her the next day
when i was in college i was a student worker in the housing office at a very large university i normally worked there full time through the summers which is when we did contracts and assignments certain dorms of which there were many were more desirable than others and in order to get a good shot of living in one of the cool buildings as a freshman you had to submit housing requests pretty early since students were assigned by date rather than by lottery once early june rolled around incoming students got notice of what dorms they would be living in though they did not get exact room number or roommate information until later in the summer this gave us time to fix problems that our automated assignment system would inevitably run into the day that building information was viewable online the number of emails and phone calls was inevitably horrible obviously nobody ever called because they were happy and before you went in to work that day you had to prepare yourself for a barrage of racist and ignorant comments from people with the worst entitlement issues known to man things like um my daughter cant live in the dorm where all the black kids go because shes a petite white girl or i cant possibly live in an all girls building because theyre probably all lesbians and virgins were not even remotely uncommon in about of the cases we couldnt even do anything about it either which lead to repeat phone calls from these people that borderlined on harassment and verbal abuse there were x spots and y people were vying for them sorry soi started making a list i would take down the name and student numbers and write down their complaints and then i would do a little clever rearranging since freshmen didnt know their roommates until later in the summer i would do my best to put the assholes together whenever possible i also would make sure their room was as miserable as possible i accomplished this by placing them in rooms that were either tiny or oddly shaped some of the older buildings had such options or i would put them in rooms that were across from a bathroom or on a wall bordering the elevator you could hear the ding through the walls it wasnt much but it made me feel better tldr when incoming freshmen students and their parents pissed me off i student worker in the housing department would put the assholes together as roommates i would also put them in the worst rooms possible be they tiny or near elevators and across from bathrooms or stairwells 
i rushed from my car to the school bookstore i was late for my final in history and had forgotten my scantron and backpack at home i grabbed my wallet handed the bookstore clerk my credit card with a help me with this quick please sheepish grin the clerk she said no and pointed to the minimum purchase sign next to the cash register i apologized for the oversight and reached in my pocket to grab loose change and pay for the scantron as i counted out my change i only had cents no problem they had a take a penny dish next to the register so i reached over and grabbed the remaining change and tried to hand it to her the lady again held her hand flat out and said no again i asked why not and she said you can leave a penny but you cant take a penny i tried to explain that i didnt have another way to pay for the scantron she wouldnt budge and physically moved the penny jar out of my reach like i was some sort of thief at the point it hit me that for whatever reason this cashier was getting off on making my life difficult and had no sympathy me now im not the kind of guy that gets mad and starts yelling or crying so i did the only thing i could think of i smiled and said of course you know there were a few things i need to grab for next semester i grabbed an overpriced bag of mampms a soda and worth of merchandise from every corner of the store i again pulled out my card and she begrudgingly rang everything up when she was through i pulled out my scantron and handed her my remaining articles and said id like to return these items please she went ballistic she started yelling and called campus security i explained what had happened to the officer and he told her that she had to honor the return i then went to class feeling like a rock star and got a solid b on the test

this happened a couple weeks ago i was driving back from college one day in the left lane of a oneway i was passing through an intesection when out of nowhere a car turning right on red crossed over three lanes and cut me off causing me to slam on my brakes normally even just cutting me off would have been enough to piss me off but this guy actually turned right on red and crossed over three lanes of traffic meaning he cut off the cars to my right as well to cut me off at this point he speeds around me and switches lanes cutting another person off at this point im pissed this guy has cut multiple people off and it couldnt have been an accident i have to know who this poon monsoon is traffic is fairly slow since it is a busy street and i have room to go around cars and pull next to him he was a guy who couldnt have been older than who was talking on his cell phone okay douchenozzle you think your phone call is more important than the lives of the drivers around you awesome but then the lights from heaven shined from above onto the side of his business car yes one of those business cars one of those business cars that hasthe phone number on the side of them i typed the number into my phone got a look at the license plate then pulled into the parking lot and made my phone call now working in customer service i know there is nothing that would make me believe a customer less than when they unleash a fiery rage on me so i did the opposite i put on my friendliest voice and kindly explained to this kids boss how im not mad but i am very concerned for the drivers around this kid the boss on the other hand was very mad he told me that when mcdouche returned they would have a very long talk thatll teach ya edit pshhwhat are you talking about i didnt spell brakes wrong

bit of backstory went to a concert last night where i was stuck near an asshole couple the gf was constantly pushing people to get near the front eventually ending up next to me she started pushing on me when i confronted her she accused me of pushing her ok sure then later on during the actual show they started throwing these cardboard cutouts into the crowd and a girl in front of me caught one however the bf tried to take it but decided to just rip it up instead by pulling on it and tearing it up he did this several times when he couldnt take it from people the revenge at the end the band had balloons spelling out their name which they threw into the crowd the bf managed to catch one and seemed happy about it in my head im like i cant let him keep this bit of happiness so fortunately for me a guy was wedged inbetween us so i was able to carry out what i wanted to do pulling out a bobby pin i snaked my arm around the bystander in front of me andpop i punctured the guys balloon right away he turned to both sides exclaiming dude i think someone popped my balloon since it was the end of the show i just grabbed my friend i was with and walked away managing to not be caught petty as fuck but oh so satisfying edit thanks for all the support im glad that others enjoyed my petty as fuck action as much as i did
this was in high school i was a freshman in orchestra and before class everyday we would get like a few minutes to tune our instruments there was a piano there too every single day a senior named scott would happily hop on the piano and play the same pieces he knew they were ok pieces but definitely not worth showing off every day this was mildly annoying but he was a senior and i was only a freshman so i thought whatever he can have this anyhow throughout the year he would constantly make comments like as someone who plays two instruments or say things like the violin is okay but i much prefer the piano whenever he could months later after hearing moonlight sonata for the th time i had had enough i played piano since i was and i knew i was much better than him after seeing his entire repertoire repeatedly over a few months after he was done i asked if he minded if i played he looked at me surprised and was like oh i didnt know you played piano i played the flashiest piece i knew which was much more difficult than any of his three pieces everyone in class was shocked and kept on saying wow i didnt know you played after that day he really toned it down with the snotty attitude 
our neighbors banded together to try to prevent us from homesharing on airbnb while the situation is being resolved with the city we told our neighbors and the city that we would hold off renting out any rooms for the time being the weekend after we informed everyone that we were discontinuing our rental my year old cousin arrived to stay with us for a few days within hours of her arrival my neighbors had contacted the city to report us for renting out our home indicating that they observed a person with bags moving in and we know that the person is a shortterm illegal renter the city in turn contact us with a nasty letter and threatening to cite us for illegal renting we explained it was our cousin and after a few exchanges they agreed to drop it well three days ago we noticed our neighbors had their boat parked on the street they did the same thing last year for the whole summer local ordinances require that it not be parked on the street for more than hours so yesterday we submitted a complaint to the city about the boat today the boat was moved to their lawn unfortunately for them this is also not allowed under the city code another anonymous complaint followed have fun paying for storage this summer friends

back in high school i had a huge crush on the mysterious guy in the class above me lets call him tom he was waaaaaaaaaay out of my league so by some screwed logic i figured i had nothing to lose and started talking to him one day lo and behold we became friends and i started hanging out with his group of friends most days after school since i came from a small town almost miles away it was great to have new friends to spend time with or so i thought as stated i had a huge crush on this guy and it was blood obvious to anyone involved tom included he had already made it clear to me and others that he did not look for a relationship with anyone and this was confirmed by his friends some of the girls told me that he just had a couple of short relationships during high school and that the girls had been the driving forces behind getting into said relations somehow i managed to push my feelings aside far enough to spend time with him as a friend god knows how a yearold girl managed that but i had my angsty upset and jealous moments for sure and then somehow we started to spend more and more time together and on a friends halloween party he actually asked me if i wanted to date him as boyfriendgirlfriend i was on cloud nine for sure and as happily in love as only a teenage girl can be until our group of friends found out their reaction was to blame me saying i made tom agree to date me that it would never last more than a few months at best and then he would get bored with me as he had with the other girls and even so far as to once telling me to break up with him and move back home i realized later that several of them must have had a crush on him at some point or another and then i showed up teenage girls can be brutal anyway most of those friendships crumbled as they tend to do especially reinforced by the dislike from several members of the group i got on with my life school ended and i went through a couple of jobs before ending up as a manager at a local restaurant i was working an evening shift when two of my old high school friends who had been very vocal about my unpopular relationship with tom lets call them maddy and ellie walked in and seated themselves at one of my tables it must have been at least years since i last met them and even longer since we used to hang out together i took their orders but they kept on looking at me trying to figure out if and why i was familiar so i decided to help them out yeah you know me we used to hang out after school both of them shines up and smiles at me that way you do when you meet people you have not seen in years or even thought about at all but still want to be pleasant to as to find out what they are up to now and if its interesting and then ellie goes yes thats it youre meenite we used to be in the park all the time and you used to date tom oh that glory that wonderful glowing sensation of victory that you usually only find in the daydreams of a teenage mind to have the privilege to be able to experience it for real no honey i am still dating tom

thank you to ufirecrouch for the reddit gold im mildmannered im quiet i dont really go out of my way to speak at all i enjoy observing and it takes a lot to phase or irritate me a lot im also muslim and i wear a hijab head covering like a nunbut not i live in a small rural town in southern ontario and for the past years i have loved it here its really nice the townspeople are wonderful and inclusive and its just a beautiful little town really i have never really encountered rudeness aside from my brief foray into the world of retail i have also never been on the receiving end of any racial abuse that is until the fateful day i went to my local grocers to see that it was in fact closed early that day sighing i resigned myself to the fact that id had to go to the next town over to get my bread and eggs the next town over wasnt nearly as nice as my town it was rundown unpleasant and had a very long history of the kkk being active in there but its and no one had heard of any such horrible business for a good long while right and itd be silly to not get bread and eggs based on things i wasnt even sure were true right so off i went i walked into the grocers and began perusing the fruits the town thus far hadnt been at all what i had thought of it as sure it was rundown but no one had given me any dirty looks i was contented and went on my way until i heard why is she here i didnt pay no mind until i heard again people like her should not be allowed in this country my back stiffened i was quite plainly the only minority around i turned around and saw a wizened year old woman long of face and sour of expression she looked at me with such hatred i was shocked her bony fingers pointed at me in an accusingly my eyes widened but i stood my ground and decided that perhaps she was just batty and went on with my shopping calmly standing next to her was her husband i presume he was tall large and just as meanfaced as his wife but he said nothing and i was going to say nothing too id let it go ii didnt want to get into a verbal altercation i just wanted to get my things and go home the old lady did not rest however she followed me around the shop and began spewing more hatred religion is evil but islam is the most evil you are dirty they should burn everything you touch youre a pig islam is disgusting go back to your own country you illiterate bitch i bet you fuck pigs and on and on it went each new epithet more horrifying than the last they were only words though she hadnt touched me or assualted me in anyway but i was starting to get annoyed what had i done to her anyway i just existed and she hated me based on my existence i for the life of me dont understand how you can hate someone based purely on their physical appearance the other customers and the cashiers were starting to stare now but no one said anything fine whatever i dont really expect people to jump to my help at all and most of them were seniors anyway i have by now finished paying her insults still ringing in my ears im about to exit the store and then i calmly turn around and face her for the first time this whole time i had been silent she had been going on about my illiteracy about how i should go back to my own country how disgusting i am etc etc so i said in my clipped accent i find it surprising that you know so much about me just based on my appearance she gestured to my headscarf and spat that thing tells me all i need to know so i said well i thought you looked like a crack whore when i first saw you but now i can see your face i realize youre far too ugly to be one she turned bright red in apoplectic rage and began screeching at other customers at this injustice i had caused her suddenly a greenaproned man with a name tag that said manager appeared she turned to him saying how horribly i had been her how im a terrible person for calling her such foul things he calmly allowed her tirade to abate and said youre a sorry excuse for a human being and you and your husband arent allowed back here again please get out of my sight he then turned me and apologized profusely for not being alerted sooner to the situation and said im welcome back anytime i thanked him and left the old lady was spitting with rage so as i drove off i gave her a cheery wave tldr called a racist too ugly to be a crackwhore manager backed me up aside i know its not that juicy but it was satisfying for me i hardly ever speak up for myself so it was a big deal to me to have said anything thank you for reading another aside i apologize to all the middle aged redditors who have read this you are all very right is not old sorry yet another aside there has been much history of the kkk in canada the kkk is not an exclusively american organization here is a link which you can find out more they were not as active as they were in the united states because canadians generally have none of that nonsense aside thank you for the comments your kindness has made my thighs quiver in joy
i posted this about a month ago in response to an askreddit thread about the worst scam youve fallen for nothing in the thread got much attention but i figured this story might find a home here i worked at subway about years ago my coworker and i were closing up for the night and some guy came to the door with a proposition he offered to leave his cell phone in exchange for to do whatever he needed to do once he was done hed return in less than an hour and give us our money back plus an extra we were young and stupid and we fell for it this was the best night wed ever seen for tips each so we felt like we had nothing to lose he left us his stolen cell phone took our money and never came back we looked up home in the contacts list of the phone called it and were greeted by a very angry owner demanding to know who we were and why we had his phone we explained the situation and told him to pick it up at our store the next day my coworker and i happened to have split shifts the next day so one of us would be there no matter when the owner showed up he came early in the morning and coworker informed me about the pickup when i came in about an hour after my shift started a car backed up to the front of the store out of sight of the window and almost in the street that ran past this seemed odd since there was no one else parked in front a scraggly looking gentleman not the guy from the night before entered and told the other guy working with me that he left his phone here yesterday and was told he could retrieve it i said oh right other guy go find it in the back i have to run outside as i was taking the license plate down i noticed the driver was watching me it was the phone thief himself i chuckled as i walked up to his window and said he could have the phone back but first i get my money back he pulls out of his wallet which i took and then demanded the extra he promised he refused at first but then i reminded him that ive got his plate number and now his buddys on camera asking for obviously stolen property he gently handed me the extra cash by crumbling it in his fist and throwing it at me so i smiled and told him his buddy will be back out soon back inside the store my coworker reports that he cant find the phone anywhere i said the phone was picked up this morning by the real owner and im calling the police scraggles ran out jumped in the car and they peeled off i never did call the police i was just happy to piss them off andor scare them edit thanks to umildlysuspicious for this flattering tldr phone returned thief out bucks no cops needed gotham has a new superhero 
when i was and my brother around my parents would frequently go out to dinner and leave my brother in charge he liked to take that time to bully me lock me in the bathroom pull my hair and all the other little fun things older brothers do to their younger sister when my parents came home however they would never believe me because there was no proof ohhh stop trying to get your brother in trouble was always their response one night they go out and minutes after they drive off my brother pushes me out the front door and locks it behind me cackling at me through the window i just stand there and stare at him i know my brother the more i fight the more satisfying the prank is to him keep in mind we didnt live in a safe suburb we lived in an urban apt complex a few miles away from a large city car breakins were common so i go and sit on the curb at night for hours and wait til my parents get home and find me they are livid and my brother finally has to explain himself the best he could come up with was uhhhh i forgot she was out there grounded for weeks without electronics suck on that

so to make this easier to visualise off the bat i made a of my wonky driveway my house has a paved lot in front of it because it used to be for parking when the house was the mayors house as well as for when my grandparents ran their businesses out of it the driveway also goes alongside of the house and opens into another pretty big area basically what im saying is that i have a lot of driveway my parents park in the back area inby the garage while i park out front in the lot by the street people like to think that they also may use our driveway to pull over and text a bit read a map etc no its my driveway damn it the other day i was poised to pull westward out of my driveway the way i always go to start my journey to visit my sister who lives about forty miles away i was checking traffic before i even attempted to pull into the road when someone started pulling into the lot part of my driveway looking to make a uturn and go back eastbound down the street where they ended up going was right in the way of me seeing oncoming traffic so we ended up reaching an impasse apparently me trying to get out of my driveway was taking too long for this person so they honked at me its annoying enough when people honk at you in the streets for something you cant help let alone on your own property as i was still technically safely within my own driveway and not yet pulled into the road i simply parked my car on the spot turned it off and got out the other person looked like they were about to get out of their car to confront me but all i did was walk through my driveway lot through my lawn up to my front door and into my house you know leaving my car right in their way bitch had to back the fuck up into the road and make a uturn down the street dont honk at me in my own driveway damn it
this happened last week i work a standard office job and have to take a packed train to and from work every day between two main train stations on this particular day i really didnt feel like standing as i was pretty drowsy and it was a pretty hot day so i attempted to do the near impossible and find a free seat on the always packed trains as luck would have it this day i managed found a free seat in the carriage next to a younger looking bloke im guessing a uni student his bag was on the aisle seat next to him so i politely asked him to remove it his response verbatim really cmon buddy its not so hard to stand im pretty flabbergasted by this but i insist i would rather sit down and he grudgingly moved his bag under the seat allowing me to sidle into the seat next to him me in the aisle him at the window now on this particular train there is no arm rest between us and this guy was clearly a little bit annoyed that i would choose to take his bags special seat so he proceeded to sprawl himself across his seats clearly over the sacred seat divide this started a bit of a passive aggressive war between us where he would do something annoying tapping his leg coughing without covering mouth etc and i gave it back to him digging my elbows outwards turning my music up loudly etc this thankfully only went on for about minutes before we arrived at the next station and another huge bunch of people came onto the train and walked through the middle of the aisle between the seats one of the commuters stopped quite close to the seat battleground and no disrespect to this lady commuter but she was significantly obese sweaty and struggling in the heat so i thought this was a good opportunity for me to be both a gentleman and get revenge at the same time i offered the larger commuter my seat and she gracefully accepted sliding into the seat and pinning the poor bloke up against the window i then enjoyed the rest of the minute trip home from the relative comfort of the aisle watching him having to sit half underneath blubber on a hot and sweaty train tldr dont enjoy sharing your seat have a whale of a time
im crossposting this story here as requested i hope you enjoy it id love to say that this was my idea but i was only a witness to this moment of genius i was queuing in the ten items or less line in a wellknown uk supermarket chain just as the cashier was helping one elderly customer bag her items with the next guy about to unload his items onto the counter a short woman in a business suit pushed her way in between him and the cashier i heard her mumble to him just grabbing lunch im running late before chucking her meal deal which consisted of a sandwich a bottle of juice and a packet of crisps onto the counter i should clarify that i was about third out of six or seven people in this queue and there was only one ten items or less lane the store was busy and we were all trying to buy our lunches as the cashier was helping the first lady with her bags and credit card the guy who was supposed to be next in line without saying a single word to the queuejumper picked her bottle of juice off the counter knelt down and rolled it along the ground towards the back of the queue she turned to him as he picked up her packet of crisps and chucked them to the back of the queue too her expression will be burned into my memory for eternity she couldnt legitimately complain because she along with everyone around her was perfectly aware of what she had tried to do plus there was a whole queue of hungry british people observing her now she stared daggers at the guy she tried to skip picked up her sandwich then storming off a whole five metres to pick the rest of her lunch off the floor then disappeared back into the aisles in a fit of embarrassed rage the tension generated in those few moments made me feel proud to be british i still dont know if she managed to buy her lunch that day
this is one that i only witnessed first hand but still felt vindicated by it i work out at a large fitness chain gym and they have a bar where you can buy drinks and shakes with various supplements i normally just bring my own but i had forgotten it this day due to being a little slow out of bed and decided to give it a shot i hopped in line behind this selfentitled suburban house mother in her headtotoe pink name brand workout outfit and patiently waited my turn we slowly move up and finally it is her turn to order but instead of ordering she just starts lecturing the employee a huge dude on how dangerous the use of steroids are for him and how his genitals will shrivel up and die and he will grow man tits and etc essentially publicly humiliating an employee for no reason at all now i have been working out at this gym for a few months and i go at different times according to my schedule but almost every time i go he is there either working or working out and the amount of dedication that he has is admirable im not saying he doesnt use them for sure but judging by body language and how he suddenly seemed so defeated i am almost certain he got that way through natural means and hard work she finally ends her unsolicited lecture and orders a protein shake with soy milk because she is trying to lose a few last pounds before the summer begins the employee reluctantly turns and starts to make the shake and she steps to the side to take a presumably very important phone call thats when i catch it the sweet sweet petty revenge instead of putting protein mix into the shake he puts in mass gainer if you dont know much about fitness supplements mass gainer is essentially very dense protein and carbohydrates so it was still a protein shake but probably calories more than what the plain protein shake would have been judging by how small this woman was those extra calories were just enough to burst any caloric deficit that she was trying to get but not too much to gain much extra weight if he keeps this up she will sit comfortably for the remainder of the summer prep time at the exact same weight completely confused as to why her efforts just arent cutting it just as he turned around to hand it to her he caught my eye and froze i just gave him a wink he smiled back and handed her the evil concoction i was sure to give him a nice tip out of admiration for how expertly he had engineered that petty revenge tldr selfentitled suburban bitch lectures someone about none of her business and gets a big helping of petty revenge
tldr went on date logged into hbo go at her place she repeatedly flaked on future dates set parental lock so she cant watch got i went on a date a couple weeks ago dropped on dinner partly by mistake had never been to or heard of the place opened the menu and the cheapest thing was damn it went back to her place she went to hbo go which she was using a friends login for but found that she was logged out so i logged in through my account we start watching movies etc and the rest of the night goes really well she confirms that she wants to go out the next night the next night i cancel some other plans so we can go out i text her a few times over the night but never get an answer the next morning she says she fell asleep when she got home around pm and wed go out later that night later that night comes and she has another excuse that we cant go out and that shes going to have a busy week so maybe we can get together next week fast forward a week and she finally breaks things off by way of cliche last night i log in to hbo go and see that game of thrones was the last watched show even though i had been watching flight of the conchords the night before shes a big got fan so i know it was her thought about just changing the password to force her to log out but i felt like giving her false hope instead so i turned on the parental lock now shell be able to make it all the way to the episode selection screen before shes denied
background i live in a duplex that is surrounded by some apartments and it is all owned by the same landlord its hard to explain the set up but basically we all have assigned parking spots and there are some visitor spots set up for everyone in the back lot my side of the duplex has spots for us directly outside of our front door separate from the rest of the parking enter douchebag now this one person was a regular visitor of one of my back neighbors she knew the parking set up but she seemed to always park in our assigned spots i left plenty of strongly worded notes that seemed to go unread but i rolled my eyes and let it slide our landlord was pretty passive and i knew hed never have them towed i was frustrated but it was fine people steal spots here all the time but one week everything changed the girls car started acting up the car alarm would go off at random at any time of the day or night for minutes at a time she apologized once saying that it only happened when she locked her car electronically but if she locked it manually it was fine i thought that meant that shed lock it manually of course not for the next week i was annoyed awakened and infuriated by her car alarm her car that was parked outside my bedroom window the revenge so one night we took the matter into our own hands her car had been at our house for days straight it was finally enough her car was unlocked so we opened the door popped the hood and disconnected her battery car dead no car alarm victory aftermath of course she is car illiterate she comes to our door and asks if we know anything about cars we say sure well take a look we pop open the hood gosh i really dont know what is the matter looks like youll have to get it towed girl had to spend bucks to get that hunk of junk hauled out of our parking lot im sure she spent even more on a mechanic to look and see our simple sabotage satisfying conclusion that also meant that by forcing her to see a mechanic they fixed her alarm she started parking in the appropriate spots probably because she realized that we were the saboteurs and her alarm never went off again the end 
my boss and i pretty much share our workload and while i will do any work given to me without complaint sometimes he really does just get a bit ridiculous giving me things one after the other and expecting me to be able to do them all at the same time while he pisses about with something unimportant or playing solitaire right where i can see him doing it in a fit of return to work misery i have decided that every time he leaves the office for a reasonable amount of time ill be making small but annoying changes to his computer todays change ive turned down his mouse speed just enough that its a pain but not enough that hell know to question it it has improved my outlook considerably edit i think im going to have loads of fun playing with these suggestions
i was getting in my car in a mall parking lot to leave guy spots me rolls up and puts his signal on my soon to be empty spot is claimed no problem i get in plug in my phone put on my seatbelt honk guy actually honked at me to hurry up really i decide right then its time to check the pressure on my tires i get out with my pressuregauge begin to check my tires after each one is checked i glance over at him after the second one is checked he drove off angrily had he waited another ten seconds without honking i would have left justice served asshole
several years back i began to receive the scam emails from nigeria im sure you are familiar with these so i wont go into a great explanation normally i can just ignore them but these were coming to an email pertaining to a domain that i owned for my computer repair business it started with a few and then grew to about per day every single day it was irritating to get an email notification only to find out that it was one of these bs emails i thoughtwhat to do what to dothen i had an idea i went to angelfire and created a free website with nothing more than a counter on it i shelled out to a command prompt and wrote a batch file that when executed erased bootini nrldr ntdetectcom then launched a browser which loaded the website i had created i put a pause in it silently recursing the windows directory just to make sure their pc made it to the website then it would shut down the pc for those of you not in the know this will prevent a computer from booting stopping at a black screen displaying an error message a good tech could have it back up and going with not much issue but i was betting against that after all this is nigeria i packaged the file into a password protected zip file and emailed it back to a few scammers stating that this was given to me by the bank and contains my banking and credit card information it is set to give a false virus warning to stop scammers the password for the first file is ltpasswordgt please do not steal my information i trust you within days the counter on my website had went from where i tested it to over i have yet to receive another email from scammers at this email address from what i understand they hack each others email in hopes of stealing victims from each other i hope that the downtime i forced upon them was enough to allow for at least a few people to be educated about this scam
my childhood friend manages a girls beach volleyball club and this past weekend was the final tournament of the season im pretty good at sports action photography so he asks me to do him a solid favor and shoot some shots for his business stuff for brochures website promotions advertisement shots etc these are underage girls that are participating on a public beach so im perfectly within my legal right to take pictures of them using them for business however is another matter i dont want any hassles in this area so i inform my buddy that he must get the ok from all the parents first as a peace gesture to everyone to give the blessing to use these pics for business i offer to give the parents and girls the nonused pictures for personal and media posting purposes this would normally net me or more but im trying to help my buddy promote his business this is me doing a solid for my buddy only father seems to have a problem with it and im told who is daughter is and to avoid any shots of her absolutely not a problem just avoid over protective dad opd and his daughter gotcha the tournament goes into full swing and im snapping action shots left and right rule of thumb in sports photography for every shots taken only are usable nearly all the parents are very cool and friendly with me cant wait to see all the pictures etc i get offered treats water and they are good no great company all except for opd who has so far been avoiding me finally his daughter and her teammate are playing on one of the courts and im shooting the other team he has a problem with that opd starts tailing me and is right beside me while i take the pictures as he obviously has no idea that a mm prime has no zoom capabilities and the field of vision is very narrow while the camera may be pointed in her general direction shes definitely not in the shot but hes passive aggressively remarking ehh i said none of my daughter and youre getting her in the shot etc nevermind the fact that his daughter who is and in a sports bikini on a public beach is on display for everyone to see but he doesnt want a hired photographer to take shots of her im finally getting fed up with this guy shadowing me left and right i get that he does have a right to protect his daughter so i ask him outright do you mind if i show you what i do opd is a little puzzled im going to take a single picture of your daughter and have you look at it and then delete it do i have your permission to do this he reluctantly says yes because the other parents were getting vocally perturbed that i wasnt shooting pictures of their daughters for the tournament i carefully time my next shot because i knew it had to make it perfect finally i get my chance as his daughter jumps to spike it while the girl on the opposing team jumps to block it at the net click what gets captured is the best shot i could have possibly taken or hoped for near perfect angle of his daughter on the right side of the frame just a millisecond away from spiking it the ball the other girl on the right side behind the net has a great furious expression as her arms are reaching out to block it to be honest front page brochure quality to be sure this image is similar but the one i took of his daughter was far its of the same tournament from over the weekend i show opd the picture through the display on the back and his stunned silence speaks volumes in no certain terms i had the shot of the day and it was of his daughter this volleyball club could literally make a career for these girls and a shot like that would be the best publicity for her to get sponsored to go pro so this is what i do take shots of these girls to help promote my friends volleyball club and boost their career with that i take back the camera and in full view of his eyes so that he can see i delete that epic picture erase yesno gt yes gt image erased the look of shock on his face told me everything he didnt say another word to me nor did he shadow me for the rest of the day yeah it sucked i had to delete that shot but i got my petty revenge on him you want to be that over protective of your daughter fine by me but you lose out tldr over protective dad refused to let me take professional pictures of his daughter in a beach volleyball tournament and shadows me to make sure i get his permission for shot and its the best i could have possibly hoped for it could help boost his daughters career and then i delete it right in front of him
starting in middle school a girl named krista started bullying me we played the same positions on the basketball and softball teams so spreading rumors about me and tattling about things that never happened were her way of securing the starting position softball was miserable she told many of the upperclassmen on the team that i had said bad things about them she told the coach that i had done things that never happened the coach was always making me run laps for things that were never so well coming into our sophomore year we had geometry together she suddenly got super sweet to me was acting all buddy buddy at first i didnt understand until she started asking for the answers to questions more often it escalated to her just flat out asking to copy my homework i let her a few times until one day i gave her all the wrong answers while i turned in the right answers she got a zero on the assignment while i got she couldnt say anything about it she knew what i did she never asked me for answers again and since she didnt have anyone to copy answers from she ended up making a d in the class 
so i fed treats to the other cat right in front of her and didnt give her one
i posted this in an unrelated thread on raskreddit and was told it belongs here this happened on saturday if dont go out of my way to pick up carts in the parking lot but if i happen to be walking right next to one i grab it and take it in with me to use i see other people do the same thing all the time so i know that i am not weird for doing it i was walking from my car to the store shortly after it stopped raining and i walked right by a cart so i grabbed it this cart was wet having been out in the rain so i pushed it under cover and grabbed a dry one while i was still trying to get my dry cart to detach from the cart in front of it it did that thing where the back flap of the the other one gets stuck on the front wall of the cart the woman who had parked right next to me in the parking lot walks up she grabs the wet one that i just brought up and growls at me why would you do that now i have to use a wet one at first i thought she was joking because she was standing next to probably carts so i smiled at her my smile only sent her in to a rage do you think this is funny i dont want a wet cart by this time i separated the carts and i just sort of push the extra cart to her and turn around because i have confrontation once done shopping i am headed to the shortest checkout line and this same woman is heading to the same one she sees that i am closer and actually speeds up to get there first at this point i am seething but as i said i hate confrontation i go to another line and as i am leaving the store i see her in the parking lot turns out both lines took about the same time from a few feet back i see her shutting the trunk of her car and walking to her door she left her cart behind my car i notice that she is playing on her phone as quick as i could i tossed my stuff in my trunk and move her cart and mine behind her car both in view of her side mirrors so she will see them and know that there is no way for her to back up without moving them or hitting them as i pulled away she was out of her car giving me the finger and shouting i have never left a cart in the parking lot before but god damn that felt good
once upon a time in th grade years ago i went to subway an ordered a blt bacon lettuce tomato now i like to add whatever i want to my blt because im at a subway and i can make my sandwich however i want to about halfway through my order the manager said anything i wanted on top of my bacon lettuce and tomato would cost extra a blt can only have bacon lettuce and tomato now i understood that adding saltpepperoilvinegar and other veggies changes the basic premise of the part sandwich but every other subway let me make my sandwiches how i wanted to make them and i expected the same service from this twat there was a long line and i didnt want to annoy everyone so i capitulated and agreed to the extra charges i figured i might as well make all these extra charges worth it so i added everything to it and extra of what i could once it came time to ring me up i suddenly lost my appetite the sandwich was no longer appealing so i told dickbag i changed my mind and he could keep the sandwich the entire store erupted in laughter and by the entire store i mean maybe people in line chuckled dickbag was a little dumbfounded and didnt say anything so after savoring the moment for all of seconds i walked next door and got chinese mr manager of the mall subway on kauai in the middle of a lifelong power trip i hope you are still working in that mall subway

this happened years ago my family was on a disney vacation and we were in the epcot park my younger brother brian and i had split away from the group and were waiting in linesgoing on rides by ourselves we were in the line for the maelstrom in norway at the time and we were among the first in line right as we had gotten inside the building we turned right and settled into our place in line were used to waiting so it wasnt a big deal the line inside the building begins with a small section of hallway where there are two solid walls with a railing on one wall before the room opens up into the more familiar linemaze of theme parks that hallway is where this happened eventually more people joined the line behind us and soon the short kid directly in back of us was yelling and complaining parents ignore him if youve never been to this particular part of disney its very dark and quiet and it was first thing in the morning so the kid was being really really abrasive it didnt help that the line wasnt moving yet but hey its disney there are always things like this still a shitty way to start the day for all the poor people nearby we tuned him out and talked about other things the kid eventually settled with his head against the railing walking along it shouting and sliding his head back and forth over the metalwood bar soon my brother who was behind me with his hip resting on the railing to keep the kid from passing us and getting separated from his inattentive parents nudged me in the dark and whispered to look behind him he was trying not to laugh i looked and the kid had reached brians butt blockade of the railing but hadnt stopped his face was burrowed into brians ass the kid had a baseball cap on and it was being pushed back off his head because he was so close the opportunity was too good to resist you should fart i said right in his face im trying he replied already ahead of me i wish you could have seen the following events it was fucking glorious i didnt hear the fart but i could tell when it happened because the kid stumbled backwards turned left and ran full speed into the opposite wall he just hit the wall bam with his arms out to his sides and everything and fell over right onto his back his parents finally started paying attention to him and picked him up everyone else in the line saw what happened but was clueless about what had really gone on oh god my sides tldr my little brother weaponized a fart and took out an annoying child

this is a story of my mother she has some issues with her nose she cant dive because she will get a horrible nosebleed it doesnt hurt her or anything it just bleeds so when she was still in school they went swimming there were those guys in her class who found it funny to sneak up on unsuspecting classmates and push them underwater she explicitly told them she didnt want that done to her of course being the little shits they were they still did it to her so when they pushed her underwater a big cloud of blood spread throughout the pool everyone fled the pool and when she finally rose from the water she started screaming and crying it hurts so much and im gonna die at the terrified children who forced her underwater this made the teacher scold the already scared shitless kids and most of them cried themselves never again was anyone pushed underwater by those boys thereafter
this happened about or years ago where i went to college football is basically a religion during home games parking fills up for several miles around the stadium tailgatingparking space gets reserved on a firstcomefirstserve basis and people camp out days in advance to rope off territory once youve roped off your spot you may consider it claimed and you dont have to stay there my tailgating group had laid claim to a patch of grass and a halfdozen parking spots we had followed all rules and regs and were totally within our rights well the morning of the game we arrived to discover that some jackass has driven over our ropes and parked his car in one of our spots we were none too happy about this and we got an idea our group consisted of a dozen young strapping dudes half of whom were powerlifters so what did we do we picked that shit up and moved it it was some small lightweight japanese import dont recall specifically and we were able to lift it just enough to fully extend the suspension and cause the tires to break contact with the ground we carried it about feet away and parked it illegally a little while later a cop came by and ticketed him the cop was very confused as to why we were waving at him with shiteating grins while he wrote out the ticket after the game ends mr jackass comes walking up looks around in bewilderment then spots his car nearby he starts swearing up and down when he sees the ticket and summons a nearby cop a different one we sat there and watched with bubbling delight as mr jackass tried to convince the cop that he shouldnt get a ticket because thats not where he left his car and clearly someone else put it there obviously the cop rolls his eyes and tells mr jackass that thats the worst excuse hes ever heard mr jackass then came over to our group and asked with some hesitation did youmove my car we looked at him like he was crazy and explained that that was clearly impossible since his car was still locked and hadnt been hotwired or anything looking even more confused he walked away to go get in his car and leave when mr jackass was nearly out of earshot a buddy of mine just couldnt contain himself any longer and proclaimed just loud enough for the guy to hear now thats what i call a manual transmission mr jackass turned around gave us a slackjawed death glare realized there was absolutely nothing he could do about it and drove away remember kids its not what you know its what you can prove
this takes a bit of explaining so bear with me ampnbsp i live in one of those new pop up suburbs you know the one all cookie cutter houses nature reserves and young families our suburb has exactly one entrance exit onto the main road its not too bad but can get a little congested during peak times im talking maybe an extra mins to your journey ampnbsp there is however a side access gate that looked like it was used as a secondary route for construction vehicles when they were first building the suburb the side gate bypasses the main entrance and takes you directly to the main road however it clearly is not a legitimate road and requires the driver to traverse through a playground nearly everyone does the right thing and uses the main road ampnbsp but this asshole in a silver lancer constantly thinks his better than everyone and uses the side gate every day i regularly see him jump off the main road and casually cruise through the gate as i and scores of others are patiently waiting at the legit entrance i imagine him with a smug smile on his stupid face as if hes just naturally smarter than everyone else ampnbsp its especially infuriating as he honks at kids dogs and families in order to cross the park with his vehicle as if its their fault that they are in his way ampnbsp so ive taken to fuck with his shortcut the access road has a gate across it but its not locked and left open since last week ive taken to closing the gate and zipped tying it shut using about small zip ties at a time this requires asshole to get of his car and try to break the zip ties hopefully that adds time to his shortcut the small pile of busted zip ties scattered on the ground near the gate makes me giggle i of course pick them up because littering is for chumps ampnbsp yesterday ive decided to escalate and have bought a cheap bike chain and am going to install it tonight screw you lancer ampnbsp update so i installed the bike chain on the gate this evening its a cheap combo thing from a supermarket but itll prevent him from accessing the gate if he doesnt have bolt cutters with him i didnt want anything too hardcore incase emergency services needed access the gate has a simple latch system build inside a box i left the combo lock with on the dial and carefully placed the tumbler inside the box so it would be evident if anyone tampered with it ill check on it tomorrow morning ampnbsp update i went and checked on the gate this morning someone has definitely tried to access the gate unsuccessfully the bike chain is completely taut and the gate has swung partially open to the maximum width of the chain as if someone has tried to break it by pushing against the gate the tumbler has been messed with too as its now on a random number i imagine he tried to get through got frustrated and had to go around the proper way ampnbsp final update so i checked again this afternoon and my bike lock seems to be working for now i did not see the silver lancer today nor was my lock tampered with so victory ampnbsp as per many redditors suggestions i had also filed a report with the local pd yesterday afternoon the dispatcher seemed not very interested and suggested i contact the local council they have an online form which i filled out this morning at work here was their response ampnbsp response by email subject matter expert am traffic operations confirm receipt of your email we have placed a record of your concern on our database recording system and well take any action deemed necessary asap when our resources permit ampnbsp so yeah i dont think its a priority for them hopefully mr lancer has worked out that the shortcut is now no longer a viable option thanks everyone 
i spent a couple weeks last year traveling with my parents in peru were chinesecanadian and i speak perfectly fluent english but i speak mandarin with my parents i had a pretty out there like this guy just for the summer cause i thought it would be fun to have while traveling so were sitting in some sort of native dancing show and im speaking with my parents in chinese from an outside perspective it looks like were typical asian tourists at this point i hear loud laughing in the seats immediately behind us its two obnoxious girls speaking english but in a noticeably swedish accent look at this chink and his funny hair cut so funny the laughter continues for a minute but they keep laughing and talking obnoxiously about our slanty eyes at this point in time my mom and i acknowledge these girls in chinese to each other i turn around with a confused look on my face and say to them calmly while shaking my head dont always assume someone cant speak english words cannot explain the looks on their faces an equal mix of shock and shame needless to say they were very quiet for the rest of the show tldr just dont be racist even if you think another person cant understand you edit spelling

i drove into town miles on a grocery run and considering degree heat was fortunate to find a parking space somewhat close to the entry after doing my shopping i push the cart to my truck and start loading the frozen items into a cooler so they can survive the trip home while loading out a lady sees the spot im about to vacate and waits after i have everything loaded i start pushing the cart to the corral and she screams out do you think you can be any fucking slower asshole well i think in fact i can i slowly pushed my empty cart right past the corral and all the way to the front entry of the store i looked over and she was still sitting there so i went to the soda machine fumbled around for change before buying a drink started towards the truck then returned to the soda machine thats when she pulled on down the aisle and rounded the corner as i got to my truck another car pulled up to wait and i promptly left edited spelling 
i would often take the company vehicle out in the morning and pick up mcdonalds for my officemates the drivethru would get pretty busy and sometimes wrap around the building the entrance to the parking lot was on the corner of the building closest to the drivethru entrance so to get in line one would have to drive in past the line pull a uturn in the lot and get in the back of the line one such morning i pull in the parking lot pass the line and turn around to get in line after a few minutes im up to the corner where the lot entrance is a minivan pulls in to the lot as im inching around the corner and instead of passing by sticks its nose in front of my vehicle this bitch is now blocking both me and the entrance to the lot preventing anyone else from entering now i normally shrug shit like that off im normally laid back not this morning for whatever reason i continue moving forward trying to prevent her from getting in line i get as close as i dare meanwhile the woman driving the van refuses to make eye contact with me shes not budging i have never gotten out of my car while in traffic but that is exactly what i did i put it in park swung my door open and flew out of the truck the woman saw this and threw up two middle fingers still not making eye contact i proceed to yell at her about the common courtesies of parking lot etiquette interspersed with my opinions on exactly how much of a fucking twat she is whatever shes not listening zero fucks i retreat back to the truck and sit fuming moving forward with the line and burning a hole in to the back of her stupid fucking minivan with my eyes then inspiration she pulls up to the speaker rolls down her window and pokes her stupid face out of the car i wait approximately seconds until she begins to give her order then i just lay on my horn she shoots me a nasty look and continues trying to order horn blaring she shoots me another middle finger i let off the horn wait theres more more horn it was a solid minute i can see her obviously trying to yell her order more horn you bet i had to change hands i started to feel guilty about all the people stuck behind me so just as im about let off she cuts her wheel and screeches out of the line and leaves victory fuck that woman edit gold your recognition is an itch on the bottom of that womans foot it is her empty toothpaste tube and tp roll put on the wrong way thank you
as the title states during my junior year in college i lived in an apartment complex where the landlords didnt give any prior notice before showings what they would do is give you a card with all the days and times there could be showings with most of them circled they always argued this was enough of a notice i realize its illegal but knew that id probably have to go to court to deal with it that way another tenant had tried to discuss this with the landlords who told him he was just a college student and they were a complany theyd just say they gave notices and they would win they also made a snide comment about my partner and i sleeping when they came unannounced one morning i started leaving any sex toys or supplies i had out in plain view all over the apartment whenever i left vibrators condoms a pair of handcuffs just as uncomfortable as i could make it look kept it up for about two weeks then one day i got a phone call from the landlord she was informing me of a showing the next day between and from then on i got regular notices for showings edit just noticed the typo in the title my bad i promise i r smart

i was riding on the bart train from the east bay area ca to san francisco this morning and it got decently crowded as it tends to do i was standing as were a handful of other people and some youngish guy was taking up two seats he must have been heading to sfo because he had a traveling backpack on his lap and a pretty big luggage bag on the seat closest to the window he notices people coming in and avoids eye contact keeps his nose buried in his book keeps his white earbuds in and ignores people who ask him to move his bag finally an elderly lady gets on the train and she asks him very nicely if hell move his stuff he looks up at her takes out his headphones tells her to piss off and then looks back down at his book she looked shocked but a businesswoman stood up and gave her her seat on the train the book the guy was reading is a very popular novel from an extremely popular fantasy series that has to do with thrones and games and ice and fire when i got off the train at my stop i tapped him on the shoulder and when he took of his headphones i spoiled the single biggest event in the book for him i could tell by how far the pages were turned that he hadnt gotten there yet and the look on his face was priceless nobody on the train noticed what i did and i kept walking with a smile on my face heh
i work at target and this happened on boxing day this time of year it is always busy and we had a line of around customers waiting to be served we sometimes have customers attempting to cut the line by walking through the way that they are meant to leave after purchasing their items and that was the case with this lady after i am finishing serving a customer and my register is open a lady practically runs from the entrance of the store pushing in front of many customers and puts a pair of shoes on my counter demanding a refund now our store recently had a policy change so all refunds are handled at the layby counter which is located at the back of the store but i decided not to tell her that sorry maam but you will have to go to the back of the line and wait like everybody else she was clearly frustrated but complied after or so minutes had passed and i had served several other customers she once again appears at my counter with the item she wanted refunded trying to hide the grin from my face i said oh did you want a refund they are handled at the layby counter which is at the back of the store she was livid after yelling at me and demanding to see a manager my supervisor who had seen the whole incident walked over and explained that it was clearly an honest mistake on my part and she needed to go to the layby counter edit some of the terminology i used might be unfamiliar layby is the same as layaway for americans and boxing day is the day after christmas and in australia most shops have huge sales including target
i have a lifelong perverted rightful sense of justice so hopefully ill be at home on this subreddit my first story years ago in my high school ap economics class i was assigned to sit in the corner of the room where i was flanked by a handful of very popular very lazy kids after every exam the teacher would announce much to my chagrin my high score to the class after a particularly challenging exam where i only scored the teacher announced that the guy to my right lets call him matt had also scored his friend behind him and the friend behind him needless to say i vacillated between selfdoubt and suspicion for a few days before i finally congratulated one of the ers on his score with an impish grin he admitted that his friend matt had been cheating off me for months and thanked me for helping so many people do so well in the class the petty revenge gears started turning in my head for what seemed like ages before i replied no problem im just glad to help at the next exam i put my my paper in very clear view of matt he had been told that i was now willing to help him and his friends i circled all wrong answers while making a special mark for the correct ones just before the time was up i quickly changed my answers back when nobody was looking turned in my exam and smugly walked back to my seat what i didnt know at the time was that the cheating conspiracy didnt just involve the kids sitting next to me but that my answers were written down and forwarded to the next periods all of which took an identical test one week later a record people failed the exam matt empathetically remarked oh man accidentallyupvotes did you fail too i flipped over my sheet nobody ever cheated off me in that class again tldr discovered a conspiracy of students cheating off me in high school purposefully misled them at the next exam and caused a record number of students to fail edit fixed some grammar details nstuff

ok let me preface this with two things im still a little just a little intoxicated from the time these events took place and i have the utmost respect for tipping tippers servers bartenders etc having worked in the food industry myself so let me begin tonight on my reading break back around my home city i attended a split birthday event of two of my friends at a downtown bar good times were being had all that stuff everything was great until one point see i had left my jacket with coat check but at some point i had lost my coat check ticket by accident for a normal drunk this would certainly be disastrous but i had my wits about me and due to planning this couldnt be that big a problem see i knew exactly where my jacket was in the coat check area i knew my coat check number i knew exactly what was in each pocket of the jacket hell i even had a photo id in one of the pockets easy enough to get me my jacket back right nah after waiting in line i explained my predicament to the attendants at the coat check in detail which included pointing to my jacket and telling them exactly how i could prove it was mine including the id in the most condescending tone possible they tell me theres nothing they can do i have to wait for closing three hours later and a manager to get it back long after the last skytrain fancy talk for subway leaves and forces me into a cab home i ask if they can just call a manager over i understand they cant just give out coats without tickets all willynilly but with a manager called over really taking the minimum amount of effort possible the whole thing couldve been over within seconds nope they clearly didnt give half a shit about me having my jacket well shit theres no way im leaving without it and having it disappear when i go to get it the next day i have to deal with this tonight easier said than done after again explaining how easily this whole situation could be resolved they decide to make their power play their power play turned out to be saying word for word were going to ignore you now now im not competitive man im not a vengeful man but i am a patient man a very patient man in this case a man with unlimited patience so i said im going to ignore you too but that is not all that i did the petty revenge you want sure thing if youre going to be waiting around for a very long time like say for bar closing you have to have something to lean against in this case l chose the empty pitcher that served as tip jar for the two coat check attendants immediately i saw a splash of panic in one of their eyes but out of their principle not a word of protest as long as they were refusing to rectify my easily fixable situation i refused to let them take in a single cent of tip leaning over the pitcher in their plain sight with a smile on my face nothing even when they tried to get clever and set out a second one at the far side of the counter a quick oh sorry excuse me gotta grab this cut through the line of drunks collecting their coats and provided me with some perfect additional arm support i was going nowhere but they were getting nothing someone had to break and it sure wasnt going to be me i just wanted my fucking jacket damn it so for the next hour and a half the last skytrain was long since gone i stood and watched with glee as the two attendants worked nonstop taking in and giving out everyones jackets without taking in a cent of tip money because of me they had damaged me in one go and a devastating one at that but i got the satisfaction of watching them slowly realize the error of their stubbornness over a long long time their faces turning from stony halfsmiles to the bitterest of longings for what those two pitchers could have meant to them lo and behold a bit before closing my coatcheck ticket was turned in and i got to leave with my jacket before the manager got involved i got everything i needed while they left with nothing success sorry if this was convoluted garbage just read below the tldr coat check attendants refuse minimum effort to get me my jacket back i refuse them their tips for the busiest part of the night edit see my comment below for more details if you want and if only these posts actually gave karma
apologies in advance for the length of this but i cant help but talk about it it was probably my favourite moment ever so im on the train heading into the city to attend a lecture im a yo student male having a pleasant enough morning it was maybe minutes to i missed my usual quarter past train which is normally crammed full of morning commuters but not to worry as class didnt start until and i usually stop by and grab a bacon roll and a cup of tea but id make class with minutes to spare if i gave up my bacony goodness tragedy i know i had just recently upgraded my bank account and got a new debit card that allowed me to use the card to pay for my train tickets on the train which was handy because the machines can be slow and i have missed a few trains in the past when using my old debit card that only worked on these machines not the handheld one that she has on her person so i thought why not use this opportunity to test out the new card as i said it was the train after the usual busy commute but the carriage was still at least full the ticket inspector comes by and shes a middle aged english woman i live in scotland who i have seen before and have noticed that she can be very rude and obnoxious and thinks shes god gift because she has authority on the train she starts to check peoples tickets tapping her feet and huffing with impatience at people who have to dig around in their pockets to find their ticket before she can move on clearly not pleased that people dont have them at the ready im sitting there with my earphones in minding my own business with my new debit card at the ready as she approaches me and asks to see a ticket i flick out one earphone and tell her what type of ticket i need and where i was going around this time we were going through a tunnel so there was a bit of a reverberation of the sound of wind gushing through the carriage she asks me to repeat myself because she claims she couldnt hear me so i repeat my request now i dont know if she had hearing problems or being english she couldnt seem to understand my scottish accent which isnt very strong at all because i had to repeat myself a total of more times each time i was progressively getting louder and louder until i was almost shouting and i could see other people on the train looking up clearly curious as to why i was talking so loud proving that they could hear me just fine finally she understands what im trying to ask her and then says in her most bitchy condescending tone well if you maybe took out your other earphone while talking i might be able to hear you better i sat for a couple seconds in confusion absorbing what she just said it didnt make sense but all attention was on me and her now and i could see confusion at her statement registering on other nearby passengers faces as well not one for confrontation i swiftly apologised and handed her my debit card she huffed and whipped out her card machine but it seemed like my morning was only going to get worse because my new card got declined i have money in my account but later that day i learned that i had to calltext a number to activate my new card which i forgot to do she was visibly irritated when i asked her to try and ring it up again but no luck im starting to get a bit red in the face cause at least half the train is looking in my direction some people were looked sympathetic towards me others just smirked at my misfortune luckily i keep pounds behind my phone cover in case of emergencies so i ask her to bear with me while i take my phone out my pocket and crack open the case then present her with the note now maybe it was because i was a young male or maybe it was because the note was behind my phone case but when i handed it to her she snatched it off me and then held it up to the light and scrutinised it for literally seconds to see if it was fake this is strange cause it has never happened before and i have used many pound notes to pay for a ticket before i ask her if theres a problem with the note to which she replies in a loud voice ill tell you in a minute boy oh shit she did not just call me boy you could cut the tension in the carriage with a knife all eyes were on this transaction at this point finally she seems to accept my note as legal tender and digs around in her purse for my change i received a few coins back a pound note and a pound note as she handed me the change she started to walk away but i saw my one and only chance at revenge so i loudly said hang on a minute and you can probably guess what happened next i held those notes up to the light scrutinizing them so intensely it seemed like i was going to burn a hole right through them as i did this the entire carriage erupted in laughter and the old couple closest to me started an applause which spread throughout the majority of the spectators the ticket womans face turned a deep shade of violet she hastily made her way to the next carriage not even bothering to check the remaining peoples tickets justice was served and i felt absolutely amazing and that was my favourite day ever tldr ticket woman suspects me of giving her counterfeit money so i suspect her right back

so i go to the fm gas station and use her rewards phone number to get the discount on gas every time i fill up i get c off each gallon thanks for the discounts you cheating whore d
i tried posting this a while ago but there were some issues with its visibility im putting it here again because it would be a tragedy to deny our beloved sub such sweet revenge background i live on an interesting little corner of the downtown area it wouldnt be inaccurate to describe it as the citys hairiest armpit lots of crack addicts dealers homeless and the mentally awry the gf and i hadnt been aware of a gentleman who was stabbed in the kisser in front of our apartment until it was reported by the local news an hour later i waved at the news crew but whatever the rent is cheap enter delilah i call her delilah but i have no idea what her actual name is heres a crack addicted weirdo who for the past year or so has enjoyed standing on my stoop smoking her lovey drug of choice when shes feeling particularly friendly she enjoys gathering the neighborhoods rubbish and refuse for the purpose of shoving it through the mail slot in my door i got home one day a while ago and was greeted by her at my door step i guess she was deeply engaged whatever existential ponderings a mind like hers could be pondering because when i politely tapped her on the shoulder to ask her to make way she flipped out and hit me twice in the chest and then left im not one to lose my cool so i didnt retaliate at least not violently enter the air horn i bought an air horn a few days ago at the local dollar store and waited for her to materialize just a few hours ago i got home to be greeted by delilah like so many times before she didnt impede my attempt to enter but i noticed that she was up to her typical shenanigans again when i entered the hallway i found some previously enjoyed popsicle sticks empty match books and what appeared to be a vigorously used condom on the floor gross i know i went upstairs grabbed the air horn went back down and waited she popped open the mail slot to shove in more garbage and bnnnnrrrrrrrrr air horned her right in the face fuck you delilah she went on her merry way im willing to repeat this process until the message sinks in bonus the video i took of the enjoy update the air horning seemed to work perfectly the first time shes still shows up at my stoop occasionally to smoke crack and perform some kind of schizophrenic tai chi but now only mail comes through the slot edit how i feel after having received my first reddit gold 
im a commuter student in college and the parking is extremely crowded and unless you come to school at in the morning you wont find a decent spot with a little luck by my side i managed to snag a semi close space well as i was leaving class entering the parking lot another woman almost ran me over trying to find a spot yelling at me in the process i end up at my car and notice that the woman has slowed down to see my glorious parking space as i get in the car she reverses instantly in the hopes of getting this spot no such luck bitch i sat in my car for a solid minutes until i saw her enter the building
i was a witness to this amazing person a couple of weeks ago while standing in line of the electronics department of my local walmart i overheard two guys behind me talking about the new xbox one the clerk was very busy and asked us politely to wait a minute while he organized his counter as he was cleaning his counter the guy behind me asks if there are any xbox ones left the clerk says there are two and went back to organizing his counter the third guy in line looked pissed but i explained that i wasnt getting one so good news for him finally the clerk finished his organizing and grabbed the ipod i was waiting on as he was grabbing it a woman approached the counter and started asking him about the xbox the clerk was just a shy kid and politely pointed out that he would help her when it was her turn she continued barking out questions to him finally the guy behind me in line said they only have the two xboxs left the clerk quickly hands me my ipod and i moved to the other side of the counter to look at headphones at this point i think we all just assumed this lady was rude but that was it then the clerk comes back with the two remaining xbox systems he lays them both on the counter and begins to ring them up the lady continued asking questions and interrupting the clerk from helping the guy who was behind me in line finally the clerk says please hold on as soon as i ring him up i will answer all of your questions the third guy in line says excuse me i was next the woman denied cutting line the clerk looked like he had no idea what to do because he didnt know who was telling the truth now at this point i was about to defend the third guy in line im sure the second guy in line would have as well if he didnt have a moment of brilliance that eliminated any further arguing or discussion on the situation he turns to the clerk and says ill take both systems the woman sat there mouth open not saying a word the third guy in line looked pissed the second guy then turns and asks if the third guy can pay for one of the systems on his card at that point the woman bulldozed her way out of the store pissed off both guys had a good laugh justice was served tldr rude woman cuts in line to get the last of the two remaining xboxs guy who was being served took both and let the guy who rightfully should have had it pay for it and keep it shut her up good
i just went to walmart at lunchtime to pick up a prescription and as im parking i see a middleaged woman who is just finishing putting her purchases away in her pointlessly huge suv she pushes her empty shopping cart a few feet so that its out of her vehicles way but blocking another car she gets into her car and starts it up but cant pull out just yet because by now i am about to walk in front of her as i go by i grab the cart she just abandoned and pull it behind me leaving it directly in front her car i kept walking into the store not looking back i do wish i could have seen her face
at my shore house parking is always tight on weekends im fortunate enough to have a driveway it is my driveway and its not a common driveway next door a bunch of college students are renting it and they think they can park in my driveway the first or weekends we are forgiving tell them to move their car and remind them that they cannot park here one weekend i came down separately my parents were already down there and took a street spot it gets annoying to shuffle cars around i saw the neighbors car in our driveway again but i had a plan this time i parked behind them and said nothing i usually dont need to drive anywhere as i bike most places about an hour and a half later we hear a knock on the door i answer it and guess who it is the neighbor he wants to move his car and he is sorry that he parked there i get in my car and flip the kill switch i park in a bad neighborhood so i have a kill switch that will cut power to my fuel pump basically my car will crank but wont start since no fuel is getting to the engine after seconds of trying to start a car that wont start i tell him my cars computer needs to reset bs story and that takes half an hour my family and i went out to dinner we come back and he was seething he gave us a death stare for trapping his car on our property he runs up to us and demands that i move my car i told him that ill move it after i go to the bathroom this wasnt a joke i really had to take a shit it completely slipped my mind about half an hour later we get a knock on the door its the police hilarity will ensue the cop said that i need to move my car out of my neighbors driveway i asked him to repeat himself my neighbor told the cop that i parked in his driveway i asked the officer to look at where the property line is as i assured him that it was my driveway i went on telling the officer that this is not the first time he has parked here and we have asked him to stop i moved my car so he could pull out it was totally worth it seeing the cop write up a trespassing ticket for my neighbor have fun with that fine buddy incident fast forward weeks we see a different car parked in our driveway we recognize it as one of theirs the windows were rolled down a bit and the car was manual in the past i have called tow companies to tow cars off our property but they never come however the cops will tow a car if it is obstructing traffic this leads to my idea i reach inside the open window and unlock the door i then hop in the car and disengage the ebrake my driveway is sloped gently down to the street i ride the brake and i was going to turn the wheel but the wheel locked i figured eh this is close enough i reengage the e brake lock the doors and get out i called the police and tell them that an illegally parked car is blocking the street they come and in quick order tow them away i was a bit short sighted on this call i forgot that even though that the car is gone the people that own that car are not gone they knock on our door and my dad answers it he said some bs like oh we just got down here about minutes ago car was towed like hours ago and i was glad to see you didnt park here i would call the police and report your car stolen we never heard from him again that day they have not parked in our driveway for a good month now edit clarity and reworded some awkward parts
my roommate sucks weve been renting a house together for about months left on the lease and i cant wait to get out of there lets call her sr for shitty roomie i wont go into all of the details of her suckiness cause this would turn into a novel but one major point of contention is her boyfriend srb he is at the house except when hes at work he cooks and makes messes but never does any dishes no dishwasher she wont do his dishes cause they arent hers and all he eats is pizza he has a music studio set up in the front room and is constantly practicing music with his various friends same songs same chords over and over and over he showers daily shaves in the sink and doesnt wipe it up and they blamed me when the sink got clogged not to mention he talks to me like im lower than a piece of shit stuck to the bottom of his shoe i could go on but suffice it to say he sucks sr and i talked a few months ago about srb needing to contribute if i had it my way hed be paying a third of the rent but because they share a room i relented on that however i told her flat out that he needs to pay a portion of the utilities this month as always it came up again sr now says that we never agreed to that apparently the only time he uses internet is when they are watching something together and the only time he uses electric is when theyre together i guess he sits in the dark anytime shes not there pure bullshit i could go on about her calling me a cunt saying she could have any guest she wants at the house so on and so forth but again full on novel so well cut to the petty revenge i changed my hulu and netflix passwords and kicked all active devices fuck you sr
 it was on our weekly ride night and he was parked across all spots in front of a local bar we hit so we blocked him in took pics of his plate and had the smokers in the group take turns standing guard he came out about min later and sheepishly asked to get his truck out he was told absolutely as soon as were done with our beers he sat on the curb quietly for min until we were ready to leave hopefully he wont do that again 
my friends bought their very first home not long after he and his wife graduated college they had lived their whole married life in married housing which basically consisted of a one room apartment on campus needless to say they were beyond excited to have their very own place and lots of room within the first day only hours after moving in the neighbor next to them started yelling and screaming at them to move their cars and that if they did not move their cars he would not only have them towed but he would file trespassing charges on them for being on his property my friends were beyond upset and didnt know what to do they were just certain that their realtor had told them that the gravel driveway was theirs as was the very small piece of land that connected the driveway to their home so for the time being they parked their cars directly in front of their house practically on their lawn in the meantime the neighbor had rented a bulldozer and parked it in the spot that he claimed was his he moved piles and piles of dirt into huge mounds blocking off entry to the gravel driveway seeing as how i work for the state as a social worker i know quite a few people at the local court house i called a few people and was directed to someone that could get me a copy of a land survey that had been done on my friends property after pulling a few strings i managed to get a copy of it this is where it gets reallllllly good almost makes me want to jump up and down again while telling this story you seethe land survey showed that the gravel drive way and the little patch of land connecting it to my friends house was theirs the crazy neighbor was actually trespassing by having his rented bull dozer on their property what makes it even better is that he had used this bull dozer to destroy their property by moving the huge mounds of dirt all over so i told my friends and they called the police there was no reasoning with this man the police officer was just wonderful he explained to the neighbor that he was trespassing and that he had to remove the bulldozer immediately and that he was lucky because his neighbors had declined to press charges against him for destruction of their property on the condition that he repair the driveway to its original condition so that it could be accessed by the owners needless to say the neighbor hasnt caused anymore problems for my friends and avoids them at all costs 
i manage the valet at a hotel our hotel is downtown and we own a large lot across the street for a while we have had an asshole in a ferrari that constantly parks in our lot illegally i have left numerous notes on his windshield to stop parking there to no avail i could have towed his car but i wanted to confront him when i wasnt too busy he once again parked in the lot i took my car and blocked him i also left a note on his windshield to see valet at hotel i also started the stopwatch on my watch hours passed and i was running to grab a car when i noticed him standing next to his car on the phone he said to me move this car i have to get out i replied ill move it when i have a chance his response was i wouldnt talk to me that way im a cop i hopped into the car i was bringing to a guest and slowly meandered back to the ferrari owner after i was done my immediate response was youre a cop id like your badge number and id like to know where you are a police officer he immediately denied that he ever said he was a cop just that he had a lot of cop friends i kindly informed him that cop or not you simply can not park illegally and i had given him numerous warnings i let him know that i was busy ran back to the hotel did a lot of nothing for ten minutes and headed back to him he mentioned how i inconvenienced him and i retorted back im sorry to inconvenience you but you dont think youre inconveniencing me when i have a full lot and you illegally take my spot making my job harder i didnt know i couldnt park here i pointed right above his car you didnt see the huge sign saying no public parking did you i was only here for a few minutes sir i started my stopwatch you were here for over an hour and a half why are you giving me such a hard time why did you lie to me and say you were a police officer after about minutes of my leaving mid conversation to check up on work he finally apologized and i moved my car out of the way a week later i was pulling a different car out of the lot and he pulled in and flagged me down saying they told me i can park over to the left i said who told you that your boss oh thats interesting i am actually in charge of this lot and you cant park here i will happily tow your car the next time i see you here well where can i park i let him know the few spots that didnt belong to the hotel but let him know that chances are he will get towed he drove off and i havent seen him since edit punctuation edit i removed the picture edit a lot of you guys have been saying that it is more pleasurable to see their face when the car is towed i would have loved to see that but it was in a remote lot chances are of me being there when a tow goes down this guaranteed that he had to see me a few weeks ago though i put a tag on a ladies car saying not to park in our spot and she would be towed the next time the next day it was back so i put another tag on her car i like to give people the benefit of doubt she moved her car from one spot of ours to another i then called the tow company when the huge tow man had showed up and put the racks around the tires before lifting it the lady ran out saying she would move the car the tow guy looked at me looked at her and said that will be dollars it is what my company charges for me to come out the woman then said i dont have the tow guy looked at me looked at her looked back at me smiled hit the hydraulic button and said then that will be dollars see you at the impound lot that was gold edit original picture is back up 
my mum and i are both carers for my gran me full time and mum part time as a result my mum has a laminated disabled parking permit in her car its only used when we really need it for gran the rest of the time its in the glove box the way we usually do it is mum and i will take gran to the doctor mum will pull into the disabled spot i get gran and her walking frame out of the car and start walking slowly with her to the waiting room while mum goes to park in a normal spot and meets us in the waiting room same basic plan when were leaving we usually dont even pull out the parking permit because we arent in the spot long enough to need it so today weve gone to see the doc he gives gran her weekly shot and all is well mum goes on ahead to get the car and its just me and gran walking out of the doctors office together a kid starts screaming while in with another doctor and scares the hell out of my gran causing her to fall over shes flailing and panicking so tying to calm her down is pretty hard and it takes me a nurse and her doctor to get her up again that took maybe mins in the mean time mum has pulled into the disabled spot she texted me asking if everything was ok and i replied saying yep well be out soon shes gotten out of her car and is standing next to it waiting gran and i come out and i see some guy head over to mums car with mall security the clinic is in a big shopping centre i see the guy standing next to the front passenger door and talking getting really angry and gesturing wildly while shes just stanting next to the front passenger side tire smirking he points at me and gran and yells spots like this are for people like her youre stealing this spot from them and it clicks whats happened gran and i get up to the car while hes still ranting demanding the security guy do something and i interrupt him saying sir could you please move so i can get my gran in the car he stops dead and goes pale hes fucked up and he knows it he moves and mum then opens the passenger side door and pulls out the parking permit she holds it up to him then quietly says if youd stopped being a self righteous douchebag for seconds i would have shown you this and not let you make a complete ass out of yourself then she turns to the security guy and says sorry he wasted your time paul turns out paul used to help mum with gran he would walk her to the office while mum parked before i moved back home to help mum but let this guy just go on cos he knew mum could handle herself the self righteous douche scurried away very quickly after that without so much as an apology edit since people are getting really hostile about this ill add my reply to a comment about how my mum want following the rules last we checked according to the law in our area my mum was following the rules if someone is with the car and can show the permit when asked they havent broken any laws or rules

background so about half a month ago my girlfriend broke her ankle in two places as such she has been unable to do most of the chores and of the food preparation or even go to work due to having to be on her feet all day at work leaving me a bears share of the responsibilities for the most part i am happy to do what i can to make her recovery all the easier how i have been wronged sometimes however i feel she could be a weensy more patient when i am making her food for her or maybe not snap at me when i dont put her refilled water cup within easy reach revenge so my girlfriend is very particular about the neatness of some things specifically her sandwich preparation its got to be neat in the center with no meat or cheese sticking out the side of the sandwich for some reason how it looks before she turns it into human waste is important since i work very early in the morning each night before i go to bed i prep her breakfast and lunch and leave it where she has access to it but every night i make her sandwich i flip one of the pieces of bread so it is pointing the opposite direction of the other slice of bread but she cant complain to be because when she eats it im safely at work i only hope the police manage to catch me before i ruin any more lives
i moved to los angeles about a year ago and the neighborhood i live in has a lot of dogs these dogs are not treated well most of them are barely more than security devices to their owners i can understand that not that i agree with it i have a dog as well that i like to take on walks unfortunately theres pretty much no direction i can go without being barked at constantly often from inches away from my face it was really pissing me off so i decided to do something about it in the most passive aggressive way possible theres this one dog that lives right by my house which is a fucking massive german shepherd and its bark literally causes pain in my ears its so loud so i put in my headphones leaned up against a tree and browsed reddit for minutes right in front this giant fucking dumb sonic booming dog the whole time its just getting more and more insane with its barking finally a light comes on and this lady comes out in a bathrobe trying to get her dog to shut up my cue to leave hope you like being woke up by your dog before the sun comes up every morning im especially excited to do this on the weekend
so i work at a very popular resort and this young woman came up to the bar today to order a pina colada she had huge sunglasses on and looked to be about so i asked for her id immediately she starts sighing and says im like christ ok if youre you should know you need to carry identification with you at bars because youre gonna fucking get carded but whatever i ask her if she can take her sunglasses off if she looks like she could be over i might be able to get away with not carding her but she actually looked even younger with them off i ask her for her identification and she starts rolling her eyes and saying its in the hotel room i tell her that i need to see identification before i serve her alcohol i think she tries to subtly threaten me im a younger girl and she starts whispering about how shes going to tell her mom as she furiously texts on her phone but i ignore it and tell her ok im going to help the gentleman waiting next to you while you collect your idi take his order and begin pouring his beer when she shouts oh so youre not going to card him this man looked to be older than with wrinkles around his eyes and a slightly graying beard the man gives her a look and then says im i pour the man a beer and he walks away with a bugged out look on his face the girl starts getting more frustrated now does my passport work at least i tell her it does but then get confused when she pulls out a picture of her passport on her phone legally i need to see the id in person and hold it i cant tell what im looking at on her shitty mobile phone so it takes me a little while but the photo is good enough for me to tell the picture in the passport is her and that she was indeed even though it was at personal risk i decide not to ruin this girls vacation and to serve her the drink but before i can respond she sneers oh is that not good enough for you either after her snide comment i change my mind and tell her its fine for the drink im going to make her and i proceed to make her the most expensive nonalcoholic pina colada she will ever buy in her life edit typo i didnt pour a bear i poured a beer 
my music tastes tend to be all over the place so the flash drive in my car has just a little of everything except maybe country but ill admit to shamelessly enjoying some stupid pop music if im in the car bouncy tunes help with mundane commutes and dammit some of these songs are just goddamn catchy one song that wormed its way into my heart was shake it off dont know why cant stand any other taylor swift song but i freaking sing along to that one every time i hear it unfortunately my boyfriend apparently does not understand the accepted car rule that driver picks the music passenger shuts his cake hole if hes sitting in the passenger seat he feels entitled to skip songs if he doesnt like them screaming crap every time he flicks the button hes done this to the aforementioned swift song to virtually every song in my s playlist even the rolling stones not cool babe so i recently had to borrow his car and what do i see his flash drive full of tunes sticking out of the radio an evil glint appeared in my sneaky eyes oh sweetie dont like shake it off too bad theres at least a dozen folders of music on his tunes drive and i copied that motherfucking song into every single one and then renamed it so that hed be blindsided when it rolled up in the playlist in the oldies folder i renamed it an elvis song for americana its a john mellencamp tune i even stripped out the album artwork on the file and changed all the metadata so that when he discovered my revenge and tried to find all instances of shake it off hed have to work extra hard to find them all and considering that in carrying out my malicious plot i found katy goddamn perry on his flash drive id say he royally deserved it bop along to that sweetums
i recently started watching mr robot and my friend dropped in one of the biggest spoilers even after me repeatedly telling him that i didnt make it past the rd episode guess what he is just on the second episode of arrow and ive watched all seasons i called him asking for an assignment and dropped in the st season spoiler he was pretty pissed off but it doesnt stop there when i walked past him in the hallway i casually said did you come to the part where seasonspoiler group assignment was where seasonspoiler was dropped followed by season in a group conversation and i plan on revealing the plot of every episode released after that suck it bitch
this actually happened yesterday but i thought it fitting for this sub every day for lunch i go to this small caf near my office as its relatively inexpensive and has fresh food ive been doing this for years just grabbing lunch finding a table putting headphones in and enjoying my break from work roughly months ago i noticed men who consistently came in at the same time i did these two men are older probably ss and for reference i am a something female these men also bring in bags full of presumably other bags junk they find through the day whatever they arent homeless as far as i can tell because their conversations frequently involve their wives and homes they just come to this caf to loiter each day they grab a corner table with an optimal caf view and spread all their stuff out then order a side item from the caf and ask for an empty cup so that they can go into the bathroom and fill it with tap water for free those kind of people one day i noticed that they would repeatedly look over at me im talking times per lunch session and in particular when i got up to throw away my trash they would stop their conversation and turn sideways in their chairs to look at me typically i wouldnt get upset about a glance but these are uncomfortable stares and creepy vibes and it is every day like clockwork i could go elsewhere for lunch but it would be an inconvenience to me so yesterday i left for my lunch break minutes early headed over to the caf put my stuff on the optimal corner table and waited until they came in knowing they purposely choose this table to ogle women the look on their faces was much different than the creep stare i was used to from them and i watched as they whispered to each other a plan b they settled on a table behind mine which does not give you a view of the caf but does give me a great view of them so the entire hour i sat there giving them looks in between bites and sips then i took my trash and walked backwards to the garbage bin so they couldnt even get look in and then left a small victory 
on a four hour flight i choose the window seat because i like to look outside the window the guy sitting behind me reaches through the crack between the seat and aircraft interior and closes my window he gets out his laptop and begins shaking and kicking my seat i put my seat in the laid back position and reopened my window
 tldr hipster drink thief sent to hospital by bouncer using persuasion not punches couple of nights ago im working as security supervisor at a nightclub this joint is a busy one but relatively little to no trouble as its a niche crowd unfortunately as its the latest licence in the area we do get an influx of people around am that we have to screen for entry as near all of them are not our core clientele some of them do slip through and as such the last half of the shift is invariably dealing with these people that dont abide by a strict patron code of conduct thinking its a normal nightclub anyway the owner calls me up to the cctv room hes a pretty hands on bloke like me and points to one of the screens clearly seen is some damn hipster leaning over a closed bar and helping himself to a tap beer about minutes ago whilst his girlfriend watched him laughing he was wearing a pretty distinctive jumper as such was easily spotted in another area so my enforcer and i go for a chat roll up on the hipster tell him he is to leave immediately hes cool with it as he was well into his cups and stoned outta his head but ive only had three beers side note never say this to a bouncer three beers is always the default number people go to when they are lying about their intake but asks why anyway we inform him about his theft he starts denying it i pull my phone up show him the recording i had made off the screen upstairs so he promptly shuts his mouth now to the revenge part he dug his heels in at the door so we had to reeducate him on how to move forward hes kicking a stink up when a devious little thought popped up me in italics him in quotes mate do you or have you ever worked in a bar thats none of your business true but its relevant for my next question do you know what tapline cleaner is what the reason that bar was closed is because we were running a chemical through the lines to clean them they were hooked back up to the beer afterwards but werent flushed clean that beer you poured was probably at least glycol or hydrogen peroxide depending on which line they are cleaning do you know what that does to your body mate no his gf is paying real close attention now instead of harping on at my doorman well itll start shutting down your renal system as it starts fucking you up internally making it seem like you are getting really drunk real quick cos your system is fighting the poison instead of processing and breaking down the alcohol its not pleasant to experience in say hours or so as you essentially just drank a toxic substance i would recommend going to the hospital right now fun fact alcohol is a toxin as well hence why the term intoxicated is used when under its influence youre full of it not by the drunken fear in you and your gfs eyes matey i shrug think what you want mate although i look over to his gf do you really want to risk it again get to a hospital ill call an ambulance if you like i turn to walk back inside my doorman plays along you want me to make the call for em guv or leave it to them i turn and look at em probably should call hes already starting to look a bit off well the gf starts panicking as i walk through the door second im through i race back up to the control room let the owner know whats happening quick check on the radio to ensure all posts are covered in my absence whilst he tees up the front door cameras cameras up the guy is across the road making himself vomit gf is crying on the phone they both jump in a cab a few minutes later speed off in the same direction as a nearby hospital this was all at around am on a saturday morning anyone who works in a hospital knows that because of this they would be in the waiting room for a long time before being seen enjoy the rest of your night you thieving douchebag hipsters
new manager takes over at work we are now required to send a daily report to him me and most of the staff are upset that this is now a requirement the new manager gets lots of emails so he uses outlook rules to filter them knowing this several staff have been changing a word in the summary of the email this breaks outlook rules and causes the email to show up in his general inbox manager gets super rattled and sends out an angry companywide email saying to get the subject right the next day we get the words right but make one word plural another angry companywide email then we get the subject right but add a trailing space another angry companywide email he is now wise to the extra space then one of my coworkers comes up with a brilliant idea we have the subject exactly as the manager requests but use nonstandard whitespaces you can make a nonstandard whitespace with alt it looks exactly like a space but has a different ascii code as far as outlook is concerned it is a different character i cant wait to see what will happen tomorrow

sorry for my english my last english lesson was a loong time ago the context my strange job its not a common situation so i think a bit of clarification is needed here i used to work as a youth animator for the church i was not a voluntary worker it was my job i was a state employee my country considers that the religion is public utility service a parish asked my boss to send someone to them they wanted someone to take care of their young people thats how i ended up working for them most of my work consisted in taking care of the spiritual and human sides of those teenagers picture a social worker aimed specifically at teenagers with a theological background to make it short the teenagers were merely considered cheap labor force need someone to move furniture need cheap waiters and waitresses for a party need someone to sell lottery tickets just call zorglubbo and his youths being in my early twenties at the time i was just considered the teenagerinchief i could get along with that but i felt it was unfair to treat those teenagers like cheap maids and as i always helped the youths when they where working i was the cheap maidinchief the dinner it was my second year working for them i received an email from the parish saying something like oh we forgot to tell you theres this important dinner in two weeks to thank all the people who work for the parish youths will help it was not a question but a fact they had to prepare the tables and the chairs to serve the food and to clean the dishes the kitchen and the dining place at the end but it was worth it they would get a small sandwich at the end yay i asked my teenagers they refused i did not insist actually i was happy they did i informed the parish they were angry i reminded them the concept of voluntary work it was pretty funny but thats another story i went to that dinner i made sure to arrive a bit early the person in charge lets call him mr patronizing mr p greeted me with a big smile mr p oh its nice that you guys changed your mind you will find your aprons in the kitchen me im alone mr p smile quickly fading away what you will do the work alone me of course not i could see a spark of hope in his eyes you asked the youths not me i wont work for you today mr p so what are you doing here me well its a dinner to thank the people who work here i work here im here to eat the look on his face was priceless they had forgotten to invite me the only thing i was supposed to eat was the little ham sandwich at the end i knew it he could not send me away thats precisely why i showed up there was a table with a mike tablecloth flowers and only seats in the middle of the room it was clearly a vip table the priest the president mr patronizing etc ive always hated this kind of elitism theyre not princes theyre just people who work for a parish the normal tables were for the volunteers like the people from the choir the people who were managing little clubs and societies the ladies from sunday school etc without a word i sat at the vip table seconds later mr p comes to me oh im sorry youre not supposed to sit here why i could almost hear the gears in his mind grinding and spinning hopelessly as he tried to find an answer the answer never came my job did not look prestigious at all but in fact i was clearly important enough to sit here i even got to watch him as he quickly added a chair at the table bonus out of the other vip looked as surprised as mr patronizing when they arrived at the table thats right people tonight the server will eat at your vip table update a lot of people asked me who served the food they found other volunteers they asked around and they found enough of them they discovered there are some people who dont like to go to the mass on sundday but are glad to help and be useful when they are given the occasion and that was great tldr important people believe that teenagers are cheap maids tonight the maids are not available and your nice vip table is ruined because a server sits with you
okay so i just stumbled on this sub today and i think i once did something you all would enjoy so back when i was in elementary school i was a pretty busy kid my parents both work full time and im their only child so i among my many chores was keeping the driveway clean easy right except that once in a while people let their dogs take a crap there and its all ewww and gross and smelly so one day i came home from school and this new lady in the block was walking her poodle it was small white and curly but i dont know jack shit about dogs tbh a few meters in front of me when they reached our driveway the dog swerved right and dropped like six or seven turds while walking a few paces in between each i didnt even know dogs did that the lady didnt even bother that was too much my pride as a drivewaysweeper was hurt excuse me maam you lost something on our driveway i yelled but she just turned around sneered at me and went on like nothing happened then it struck me it must have been her dog that had ruined my driveway with increasing frequency lately so i did what any reasonable nine year old would do i grabbed my trusty shovel swept all the turds on there and marched over to her house being paranoid someone would see me and id get in trouble all the while and dumped them on her doorstep patting them firmly into the mat with my shovel and ringing the bell when i was satisfied with the mess then running away and giggling maniacally i never told my parents about this but i saw her on my way home after that a few times shed always glare at me but the frequency of dog poop in the driveway went back to normal 
so this is a tale from me as a customer not as an employee i do work retail and let me say its a pleasure being on the other side very liberating customer is being absurd or rude i can audibly scoff at them or even tell them off if the fancy strikes me thus i tend to enjoy encountering crabby patrons when im shopping i feel like a vigilante superhero helping the weak or unempowered a retail worker is being mistreated unfairly beak to the rescue i shall avenge thee brethren when working or not i have a talent of taking out my aggression passively working people up in subtle ways that they can pick up on but any rd party would never catch i work them up and then when they finally blow i look like a saint and they look like an unreasonable madman anyway im at the post office usps standing in line i get inside and can tell its going to be a long wait there are only two postmasters staffed and the line is quite long well most people are patiently waiting but this woman in front of me is clearly a ticking time bomb as soon as i walk in behind her you can tell theres going to be trouble shes rocking back and forth with her package trying to see around the line and investigate whats taking so long hint the long line as though she can do anything to remedy it well sherlock figures out that there are only two people helping customers and she doesnt find that suitable she lets out a sigh no response she shifts around and lets out another louder sigh again she does not get the attention she is seeking then she sighs again and looks around for glances of pity im thinking now listen lady were all waiting not just you you know the saying you arent stuck in traffic you are traffic well same idea youre not the only one bored in line then she loudly exclaims like molasses in january i cant believe this and she looks at me like ill sympathize with her i give her a glassy look she continues quite loudly now this would be a sitcom if it werent so frustrating you people arent funnyyoure just making me mad everyone ignores her including the employees i exchange a look with one of the employees and shrug helplessly a few minutes pass and shes huffing and sighing very loudly these idiots cant even do a simple thing like take a package its not that hard youre just idiots look at that woman she says to me shes a freakin retard you just know it i look at her and shake my head disapprovingly as a response im not going to get into it with this lady not overtly at least i decide i must make my move soon she turns around to talk to me despite my pointed attempt not to participate in her bellyaching she says i have to return this today she lifts an amazon package to show me if i dont get it in today i wont get my refund i was supposed to return this months ago but they can wait they need my business she says this last part with a smugness that i dont really understand as she waves it around i notice something and im sure my eyes sparkled with mischief the return shipping label is for ups not usps shes talking so much about returning it i could easily say something usps isnt going to take your package lady youre at the wrong place waiting in the wrong line but i dont say anything at this point weve been waiting a good minutes and i expect well have another minutes at least about ten minutes pass and weve made a frustratingly small amount of progress but i dont let it bother me instead im channeling my energy into making this ticking time bomb of a lady blow shes been complaining to me and ive been purposely feeding into it everytime she complains to me i say oh i know this is ridiculous acting like were both very upset together like shes got an ally finally shes the next up shes messing with her package and notices the rs says ups and not usps she turns to me do you think theyll take this oh shit ive been foiled i think oh im sure they will theyre run by the same entitya total lieso theyre obligated to take it theres really no difference they just want to avoid the extra work i say and she nods we go back and forth a bit and ive got her convinced she can ship it here i know this is cruel to the poor employee who has to help her but my goal is to humiliate this unpleasant woman she gets up there and tries to ship it obviously she is told she cannot she begins to get more irate than before and after a fair amount of whining turns to me they wont ship it because its ups unbelievable i look at her like ive never spoken to her before in my life what sounds like youre at the wrong place she looks at me and at the package and then at the employee shes too mad to be reasonable to simply say oh but you just said they would to save face i continue acting like ive no idea what shes talking about she tries arguing with the employee again youre telling me i waited almost an hour in line to get turned away whos taking it like a champ these people are grizzled and stonefacedthey dont give a shit about customer service he simply says no and calls me up i walk up calmly and say some people huh within earshot of her she goes ballistic and throws her package into the wall and huffs out of the post office no one says anything but just stares in complete silence she slams the door and then shortly after runs back in and grabs her package then everyonealmost the whole linestarts laughing and laughing oh it was glorious i am the puppet master dance 
i was pulled aside while going through security because i was told i had an unauthorized amount of liquid at the bottom of my bag bullshit i planned my packing to a t i put all my liquids in travel size containers then put those containers in a ziploc baggy then put the ziploc baggy on top of my bag so i could remove it easily and place it on the conveyer belt separately from the rest of my things just like they tell you so i try to reason with him but whos going to believe someone that claims no i promise theres nothing in there that breaks the rules trust me and although i tend to think that tsa agents are dicks he was just doing his job so i let him he slowly took everything out and placed it on the counter my underwear bras a box of condoms some tampons that i had in case of emergency all of it just sitting there as he examined everything to make sure i didnt have any unauthorized liquids he gets to the bottom and lo and behold he finds no liquids he sort of gives me this smug look and shrugs saying well doesnt look like theres anything here and then starts to place things back in my bag after a few items he stops and asks did you want to do this i think it was the way he phrased this question that made my response sound less dickish than it really was but i said no go ahead you seem like youre doing a good job and so i sat there and i watched him struggle to put everything back in my bag to make it fit i know it probably doesnt sound like it but the whole thing was pretty uncomfortable especially when he got to the top and had to sort of reorganize things realizing that his first attempt wasnt going to get all my clothes back in the bag serves him right though making up shit about me having liquids in my bag so they can search it youre going to repack my bag and youre going to repack it right buddy
my condo neighbors are pretty much an annoying waste of space they dont help out with anything rarely take out the trash yet are always complaining about stuff that they find inconvenient they pretty much treat the other neighbors as servants they expect to do their bidding after returning from vacation i noticed the neighbors kiddie pool laying out on the lawn it had obviously been there for a while as the grass underneath was beginning to die knowing it would do no good to say anything i rolled up the hose theyd left lying around as well moved the pool off the lawn and prepared to mow the lawn which of course had not been mowed since before i left they use the lawn but have not mowed it once in the years theyve lived there a couple minutes later the neighbor arrives in her car i am at the other end of the lawn pulling out some weeds so i dont notice until a couple minutes later that she has taken the kiddie pool and moved it back to the lawn out of pure spite after moving the kiddie pool off the lawn again so i could actually mow a chance for revenge presents itself i hear that the neighbors had come out onto their deck and are attempting to have a nice quiet dinner outside well our lawn is not that big so we dont have an electric mower but we do have a very loud weed whacker well guess what i suddenly developed the desire to whack the edges of the lawn slowly and thoroughly 
i worked at a rotisserie and one of the deals is chicken wings for these wings are tiny and the rotisserie is designed so i pick the ones closer to me to aid rotation of the foods so we can keep track what came out where every week there was a woman whod order and she would insist on picking which ones she wanted all of them the glass is about three feet away from her too and i cant see her pointing through the top shed make me go through this charade every week and id often burn myself from the ones she made me get which were tricky to reach on my last day at the rotisserie i decided to play with her shed point to each one and id deliberately choose the smallest one around the area she was pointing to and put it in the bag shed angrily shout no put that one back i want that one so id instead remove a big one she made me get from her bag took a solid minutes out of her life and she ended up with a bag of all the small ones edit bit of clarity on the chicken

we were on the last train back home from historic city after a saturday evening on the sauce its a comfortable train never too many passengers and the buffet car was still open so we could start to sober up with a coffee so we settled down in the quiet carriage no mobiles no audio no shouting for a relaxing ride home unfortunately three stops out of historic city is chavtown if theres any trouble on the train its always caused by people from chavtown and true to form a party of chavs from chavtown barrelled into our carriage just a minute before the train was ready to leave edit from historic city fine wed only have to put up with them for three stops shouting screaming swearing and generally being obnoxious though the amount of screaming was getting a bit wearing even just one minute after we set off conductor a polite well turned out young guy comes through the train to do the customary ticket check we showed ours he moved onto the chavs can i see your tickets please ladies and gentlemen fuck off would he stand his ground call the british transport police dump them off at the first station to our surprise no he just walked on into the next carriage minutes later and the train draws up to chavtown unusually the conductor hadnt made an announcement over the tannoy to say our next stop will be chavtown and once the departing passengers had made their way off the doors were locked doublesharp i think i even saw the conductor running up the platform to make sure the doors were closed promptly and the train set off again half a minute early at which point the chavs suddenly realised where they were ran out to the vestibules and started beating on the doors sorry guys the trains going youll have to get off at remote rural village the next stop no this is the last train of the night there arent any more back to chavtown tell the train conductor to fuck off thatll be a taxi ride back home from remote rural village to chavtown guess it would have been cheaper for you to buy a ticket in the first place
i actually have this subreddit to thank for this one its morning rush hour and i am on a fairly crowded train all of the seats are taken so myself and others are standing in the aisles and near the doorway we pull into a station and there is a guy in one of those big mechanized wheelchairs at the platform he waits patiently for us to move to middle of the car to make space and like civilized adults we do except for the girl next to me she doesnt notice the whole car moving in so i say excuse me she ignores me so i repeat excuse me could you move in she doesnt acknowledge me but actually turns away so i know she heard me now the whole car is looking at us because the train wont move until this guy makes his way in i know now that she is just chosing to be a massive bitch i squeeze my ample posterior past into the human shaped empty space right next to her probably smacking the poor people sitting down with my purse and butt i apologize to the couple of people of whom have had their space invaded the wheelchair gets on and we finally move im pissed but what are you going to do well that day the gods of petty revenge were smiling down on me because just two stops later i see her putting away her book and getting ready for her stop but because she hadnt deigned to look at the wheelchair dude i guess she didnt notice that he was basically blocking that exit and that people were using the other two exits of the train so as she sees this weve already pulled up to the stop and she has little time to make it to the other doors before they close i immediately recalled a story id read here and readied myself i hear excuse me i continue reading then a excuse me louder and now i can feel her trying to push by i make myself occupy as much space as possible in the little train aisle but eventually she wrangles past me and makes it to the doorjust as they are closing i got to watch her angrily muttering to herself as we pulled away and it felt delicious the train stopped in another blocks so it wasnt the end of the world for her but i like to think of her walking those blocks in her cute heels and getting to work minutes late because she couldnt be courteous for a handicapped dude
so this happened to me years ago i will keep it as pertinent and to the point as possible as to not bore you all in i was travelling up to new york i flew in and was waiting for a shuttle to take me to columbia i put a bag in the shuttle and realized i had left a bag inside the airport i went to get the bag came back and the shuttle had departed with my bag inside which had my computer in it i ended up tracking my bag to the companies office and took a taxi to get there albeit two days later i got to the office opened my bag up and my macbook computer was gone as you can imagine i was very upset but i kept my cool as i pretty much felt i was sol now this is where the story gets interesting after travelling home a day later i get an email from apple thanking me for contacting them about my computer knowing i had done no such thing i contacted them to explain to them what had happened they immediately agreed to help me and told me to locate my serial number from my receipt this is why it is always important to keep receipts everyone i gave them the number and they were able to track the computer back to new york and even had the name of the individual who had the computer with this information i contacted the shuttle company after many phone calls with higher ups of getting nowhere and them basically telling me i was sol i gave them the name of the individual their demeanor immediately changed and it turns out it was one of their employees who had my computer they agreed to refund my money as long as i would not release personal information such as names the company name etc with the information i had i decided to become a vigilante i contacted the individual posing as an apple genius telling him we could upgrade his computer under a promotion for no cost all he had to do was bring it in he brought the computer in and was arrested on the spot tldr guy from shuttle company stole my computer applecare helped track him down played detective got him arrested from hundreds of miles away
i moved into a new place and as soon as the weather got nice out a rather annoying thumping started up against one side of my house oh great the twin tweenage boys like to wail soccer balls against our adjoining fence the ball kicking continued daily and would go on until it ended up flying into our yard and then instead of coming to get it or asking for it they continued until rest of the soccer balls they owned made it into our yard they have a lot of soccer balls then if we didnt throw them back which i stopped doing after a few months because i had other things to do with my time their mother would come and ask for their balls back after a few days we asked if there was anything they could do to maybe avoid kicking so many balls over the fence or ya know just come fetch them on their own so it wasnt my job nope apparently the old neighbours were okay with it so we should be too eventually after waking up my toddler several times almost hitting him in the head and the last straw waking me up when i was super pregnant from a nap i had enough i went and dug through our sports equipment found the air pump went and got the balls emptied them of all their air while giggling with childish delight and threw their empty ball carcasses over the fence onto their trampoline for them to discover when they came back out that was the last time a ball ever came over our fence my husband tells me it was a childish thing to do sure was and it was god damn satisfying 
i work overnight and came downstairs this afternoon to an empty cup of halloween candy it was mine he knew it was mine because he saw my boyfriend give it to me as a gift he is always eating things that are explicitly mine and not for him one morning i bought hummus for lunch and put my name on it and told him not to touch it and everything of course not only had he eaten it in the four hours i was gone he had put the empty container back in the fridge to mock me so guess what motherfucker hes sitting on the couch and i sat down and took the remote hes super anal about muting commercials so not only am i not muting them any time any content comes on i immediately change the channel until i find commercials he still hasnt realized what im doing and looks up from his phone with hope every time something that isnt an ad pops up im cackling evilly on the inside i wonder when hell figure it out so fuck you chris enjoy this ad for kitkats that you have seen eight times in the past half an hour that was my only halloween candy
this revenge story was posted in altrevenge years ago once upon a time there was a man who owned a piece of land next to a thriving restaurant now this man had owned the land for a long time years and it was undeveloped he had bought it cheaply but it had great highway frontage and he had always dreamed of building a little used cars lot or gun shop on the tract as his retirement pastime now the man had had the tract zoned as a commercial lot when he bought it but when news leaked about the upcoming development the restaurant owners petitioned the zoning board to overturn the commercial zoning and reinstitute the original agricultural zoning by the way all land in the mythical state of kentucky is zoned as agricultural by default this was unfair illegal and generally rude but the restauranteurs brother was the county zoning commissioner so things naturally turned agaist our wouldbe entrepreneur after fighting the good clean playbytherules sort of battle and losing our wouldbe entrepeneur gave up he decided to accept the county zoning not to see the tract go idly unused the enterprising retiree decided to pursue another business venture he raised hogs lots of them two hundred and four to be exact on his little acre tract for those of you unfamiliar with the climate in timelost kentucky the summers are downright southernly in their humidity and heat as you can imagine a rather malignant odor grew up around the thriving hog farm patrons of the restaurant ate elsewhere anywhere else to be exact in a matter of weeks the zoning commissioner reversed his earlier ruling returning the commercial status of the lot it is another caveat of kentucky zoning law that land can always be used for a purpose lesser on the scale of hierarchy than its current zoning everyone especially the restauranteur was surprised when the hog farm remained in operation nothing not even substantial financial offers could convince the new farmer to quit his now beloved occupation exactly months and four days after the opening of the hog farm the restaurant closed its doors for good the farmer in a fit of depression ceased hog farming and decided to open a small sporting goods store instead it remains there to this day alongside his newlyacquired restaurant
so i want to start off with that this was not my revenge but i felt as a customer that i had been avenged in small way today while going throughgetting to a mcdonalds drive thru i was going at what i felt was a reasonable and safe parking lot appropriate speed i had another vehicle a pickup truck happily following me through the parking lot to the ordering boxes as well as i reach getting to the entrance of the ordering boxes a woman in her car comes veering in and cuts me off just before the entrance of the ordering boxes i nearly shit myself because i had to brake pretty hard to avoid a collision and i know the truck behind me was pissed because they were laying on their horn pretty good this woman essentially just cut in line on both of us i kind of roll my eyes because if someone is in that much of a rush to get some greasy cheeseburgers in them i will let me be i just pull up to the second ordering box i dont know how common this is but mcdonalds in my area just started making their drive through have two sets of ordering boxes so i guess they can help two drive through customers at a time as soon as i get to the ordering box the mcdonalds employee takes my order and happily tells me my total at this point i hear some screaming and yelling coming from the other ordering box from the woman who just cut me off take my damn order i was here first i laugh inside kind of thinking that the mcdonalds employees probably saw two cars show up suddenly and just decided to take my order first i figure it was karma shining down on me i pull up to the pay window and right away i can tell the person collecting money is the one taking orders usually at these double drive thrus the mcdonalds employee needs to confirm that i am paying for the correct order as there is usually two people taking orders at the same time today this employee doesnt she just reconfirms the cost and tells me to pull to the next window as i pull away from the pay window i hear car horns and a moment later i see the truck not the douchey woman in the car that was behind me before is pulling up to the pay window as i get my food my gut feeling is validated seems like they keep the drive through windows open when its nice out so i can hear the employees talking amongst themselves employee do you think we should take another vehicles order before that car employee i dont know theyre honking quite a bit now employee well they shouldnt have cut that other car off i drive a car employee someone should walk out with an out of order sign and put it over that box then remove it when that car leaves haha

i was in a hurry to get to work trying to get gas i was next in line at a pump and had been there for about minutes when the car in front of me pulled out and i started rolling forward this dude in an audi whipped in front of me and took that spot the guy jumps out and starts trying to pumping gas but apparently it turns out that spot was cash only because the credit card portion of it was broken or something at this point ive gotten over the fact that he took my spot and was minding my own business trying to back into position for a pump on the other side just as i was turning my head to back into the spot this audi whips around and steals that spot from me so now hes two for two in being a dick and im staring daggers at him he jumps out swipes his credit card grabs the gas pump and proceeds to try to pull it around his car to the gas tank which was on the other side looking flustered he tugged and tugged trying to get it to reach but it just wouldnt so there he stands in a gas station having cut me off twice and unable to even pump his own gas i think it all became too overwhelming as he then jumps in his car and drives away i finally back up into the spot i was waiting for pissed and running late when i go to swipe my card and pump my own gas grab my receipt and go on my merry way it was only when i looked at the receipt later i realized that guy had never cancelled his credit card so the machine didnt even read mine that guy had bought me a full tank of gas for my troubles i was late but so very happy that day at work tldr jerk stole my spot twice at a gas station and then accidentally bought me a full tank of gas
i boarded a plane today and my seat was in the second to last row by the time i got back there all the overhead space was full except for one slot a man in the last row grabbed it and put his backpack up there excuse me if that can fit under the seat in front of you id really appreciate if i could get my suitcase up there id rather put it here he said i understand i replied but this is the only space my bag can fit again he said id rather put it here despite her earlier announcement to put your smaller carryon under the seat in front of you the flight attendant came by and told me id have to check my bag since there was no room i pointed to the mans bag in the overhead and she just took mine and handed me a bag tag i realized there was a very simple solution he was the only one in his row id have to wait the whole flight but this would be easy when it was time to get off the plane i stood up and simply didnt move im not a small guy he was stuck behind me he coughed then he said excuse me then he asked me to move i said id rather stand here and i did blocking his way for five solid minutes of awkward i knew id have a long wait when i got to baggage claim anyway this was clearly the best use of my time
this week ive been traveling to site for work this involves a three hour train journey each way could be worse i like trains the company is paying for my travel and it gives me chance to catch up on reading yesterday evening the train home was busy but not crammed tired after having to be on my feet all day rather than sat on my arse in the office i suck my nose in my book and kept my head down luckily the majority of my fellow passengers seemed to feel the same way as a peaceful silence seemed to settle over the carriage until a lovely young lady got on and sat opposite me cant fault her for that there werent many other free seats and i apparently look unobtrusive what i can fault her for is sharing her music with us she wanted to listen to now thats what i call music lack of headphones be damned having been enjoying the previous peace and quiet this was a shock to the system so i politely asked her to use some headphones to be met with the response of dont have to its a free country too knackered to discuss freedom of speech in regards to government censorship and unable to find the xkcd strip that always gets rolled out i sat and seethed quietly and pondered fighting fire with fire fight fire with fire ive got all eight metallica albums on my phone im sure a quick blast of one of them will show her the errors of her ways or maybe rammstein after all the only thing more antisocial than metal is metal growled in german while considering which track to play little miss cant be wrong made up my mind for me she stuck on taylor swifts love story now a hairy tattooed biker in his mid s tends to get weird looks at a pop concert where the target demographic is year old girls but i dont care id call her my guilty pleasure but i dont feel the slightest bit guilty about it when those familiar twangs emanated from her phone i knew what i had to do me singing in public is banned under the geneva convention but there was nothing to stop me lip synching the song to her maintaining eye contact i started mouthing the words becoming more and more animated as i noticed others watching me over the tops of their evening papers i got more exaggerated in my movements as the song went on readying a washer i had left over from the site as a ring for the final verse as the music swelled and the climax approached i knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and she turned the music off out of embarrassment id got what i wanted but deprived of the big finish i felt unsatisfied my peaceful book reading felt hollow 
so today i was in greggs in front of a rather large woman she was big and obnoxious shouting at her spawn children who were busy running around throwing things at each other and just being a general pain this woman starts to shout at the person in front of me getting served you better not take those last sausage rolls you fucker well i couldnt just let her get away with swearing at someone for no reason when it was my turn to order i got my regular which was pizza slices and then something i dont normally order i ordered the last sausage rolls knowing shed have to wait minutes for the next batch to be ready damn it felt good watching her shout and swear at me as i paid for my goods and left i didnt even want the sausage rolls and ended up giving them to some homeless in the city center 
so tuesday before last i parked my car in a minute parking space at the mall upon returning to my car exactly one hour later i find the mall security guard in the process of clamping my car i run over to the guy and ask him to give me a break to which he responds in an arrogant tone sorry mate its sixty minute parking here i watched you pull in at and its now obviously i found this to be completely unreasonable so i point out that the car park is only half full and this is not a good impression to leave on a mall customer he responds with im just doing my job but if you want to throw bucks my way il take off the clamp given the circumstances i gave him the cash and went on my way the next day i get a call from the mall head office in regards to my interview for the position of head of security they inform me i will be starting the following monday revenge time first introductions at the security office go very well for most needless to say i fired his ass for extortion edit changed last tuesday to tuesday before last sorry dont own a time machine 
let me set the scene for you be me at the deli counter of the local grocery store there is a line so i am patiently waiting my turn as im next in line a woman decides to skip the or people behind me as well as myself and claim her spot as next because she is already minutes late to an appointment the deli lady asks if i mind letting her go next and i respond with im a patient person she must be in a real hurry i then place my order with the other deli lady after the impatient lady il il says to no one in general that she was supposed to be in the next town down the interstate minutes ago and she is running very late me over hearing this let her know i just came from said town and that there is a car wreck on the interstate going that direction and she should probably take the back road il thanks me for helping her catch up on some time but little does she know there was no car wreck and i was just mad at her for cutting in front of everyone i also received my deli meat before her because the deli lady wanted some petty revenge too i hope you were extremely late to whatever kind of appointment you were going to impatient lady
one year during the time that i was studying in another city i was flying home for the break by myself it was a domestic flight on a small aircraft an a i think and i followed a mother and her whining two kids down the aisle hoping that they were at the opposite end of the plane than me my worst fears were confirmed when they entered the row behind my allocated aisle seat there was a boy ish sitting directly behind me the mother next to him in the middle and a well behaved complacent little girl next to her who turned out never to be a problem i cant say the same for her brother as we climbed out of the clouds i busted out the laptop to start watching a movie i had headphones and was getting into it when i noticed a nudge in the back of my seat hoping it was a oneoff the nudge happened again and again and i realized the kid behind me was kicking my seat this was no pushing with the foot this was fully fledged kicking that was not stopping i turned around to see if the mother was doing anything about it and she just ignored it reading her magazine after ten minutes of feeling every kick i turned to the mother and said excuse me would you mind asking your son to stop kicking my seat she then forcefully pushed his knees down so that his feet were on the ground and didnt say a word to me rude five minutes later it started again only harder this time this kid was spitefully and intentionally pissing me off and the mother clearly didnt give a fuck so when the air hostess came to offer drinks i had an idea of how to teach the kid a valuable life lesson dont be a cunt after i asked for a coffee i heard the kid asking for a cup of water this would work perfectly i felt the kicking stop when he had received his water and i heard him extend his tray to put it down i couldnt be sure that his cup was on the tray but i figured id go with the plan anyway i pressed the recline release button on the arm rest of my seat and violently shoved myself backward with force the full cup was indeed on the tray and flew backward covering his lap in water he said aahhhhhhh and then started complaining to his mum that the man in front of me did it on purpose she was annoyed and obviously hadnt realized id done it on purpose and said excuse me you have spilled water all over my son i replied well next time you take your kids on a plane maybe you could ensure that theyre not annoying other passengers by kicking their seats when it makes the difference the guy next to me laughs and fistbumps me the mother shuts up and the kicking stops and i watch my movie tldr kid sitting behind me on the plane doesnt stop kicking my seat when he orders a cup of water and puts it on his tray i violently recline my seat covering him with water the kicking stops
years ago i worked at a large chain grocery store in the southeast us you can probably guess which one i had a manager that just did not like me for example my car broke down on my way to work on my birthday and when i finally made it there she chewed me out in front of the store for coworkers and customers alike to spectate she often pushed me to quit school and work full time because she was so certain i would fail and she needed the shifts covered well saturday before eastera busy day for them i was back in my old city now gainfully employed and quite happy i stopped in that store to pick up a few things it was so busy that she was relegated to bagging groceries perfect i made my way to her line with a huge grin on my face she recognized me this particular chain makes baggers ask guests if they would like help taking their groceries to the car she must have forgotten so i specifically asked her for help she would have been reprimanded for refusing and thus obliged shes a big woman the uniforms are conservative the parking lot is huge we are in south florida and the employees cant accept tips i relished in walking her to my new car a car that would have been far out of my reach on a grocery clerks salary as she finished loading my groceries she said come back and see us again and i said yeah i guess youll still be here 
were in our busy season at work which usually means about hours of overtime a week with the occasional voluntary saturday this spring has been awful however hours ot every week with mandatory saturdays this week marked the th saturday in a row i had to come in time off requests have been denied except for the supervisors and one mother was forced to miss her childs graduation additionally management has been extremely tonedeaf in their communications to us no empathy for the sacrifices were making i have a legally disabled wife at home along with a year old force of nature toddler and many of my coworkers are single mothers and their emails are motivational cliches about working harder so when my supervisor asked us to submit our favorite motivational quotes i saw my chance so far he has forwarded quotes ive submitted unattributed from hitler stalin and chairman mao to the entire department im working on finding a usable pol pot quote for tomorrow tldr management is mean i get them to quote hitler

i work in a high rise office building occasionally when nature calls the stalls on my floor are all occupied now as i have been working here for several years i know where the least used and therefore cleanest bathrooms are which is helpful for such situations it just so happens that x floor has a very low density of people and so i usually relocate there when the need arises the past few weeks when i had occasion to visit my alternate bathroom of choice i noticed one stall was always occupied it wasnt until monday that i happened to catch a glimpse through the crack between the door and the frame and see that the stall was empty intrigued i checked the door and it was locked fortunately i have a leatherman and the lock has a flathead slot on the outside to unlock it in am emergency after taking care of what needed to be done i got curious i noticed the same unoccupied stall was locked yesterday and on speaking to some colleagues my observances were corroborated there can be only one explanation someone in this building thinks they can have a private stall all to themselves my revenge is simple i now no longer use the bathroom on my floor every day when i need to drop some weight i come up to this floor and use our private stall then i leave the door open in case anyone else wants to use the vip throne bonus guess where im posting this from
a few years back my husband and i rented a basement apartment from a women that lived in the house upstairs when we moved in we agreed on which would be our parking space and which would be hers as well as that we would be responsible for clearing our own parking space of snow and she was responsible for her space the first year things went as agreed and everything was fine the second year after every snowfall i would shovel our side of the driveway my husband couldnt shovel due to illness every time we would leave after the apartment in our vehicle after the shovelling was done we would come home to the landlady parked in our spot the first few times i would shovel the other side of the driveway so we could park since you couldnt park on the road in the evenings in the winter in our city as soon as we left again she would move her vehicle back to her own now shovelled spot this went on for a couple weeks until my husband finally had enough of seeing me breaking my back to shovel the entire driveway the next time we came back and saw her parked in our spot he turned on the four wheel drive to his truck and drove up over the snow to park in hers we left and came back a couple times that day doing the same thing and compressing the snow down once he saw her leave he moved the truck back to our own spot she ended up being gone until the next morning so when she came home she had to shovel to get in or face parking in the street and getting towed except now the compressed snow had been sitting there for an entire day including overnight so it had hardened making it more difficult to shovel she ended up having to pay a plow to come shovel for her

so i work as a bartender at a smaller bar in downtown minneapolis it is considered standard for the servers to tip me out at the end of their shift based on a percentage of their tips in order to compensate me for the time i spend making drinks for their customers most of the servers are good for giving me of their tips when they are having their free shift drink allowed rail drink or domestic tap per shift but there is this guy who never tips back its not technically required this same guy lets call him b also feels entitled to all the free booze he wants actually a lot of people do and some of the bartenders will actually give them free booze all night i dont usually but sometimes i do give them an extra drink or two if they had a slow shift so fast forward to last night i made somewhere between and drinks for this server while having a slower night at the bar it was nice and people wanted to sit at the patio and i knew me must have made at least based on the fooddrinks he was selling his shift was nearing an end and a cute girl he was trying to impress came in to wait for him to get off he comes behind the bar a big nono and tells her that her drinks are on him then tells me that she can have his shift drinks turns back to her and suggests she order an expensive microbrew and she does here is where the revenge part starts i know he isnt going to tip me out for the drinks i made for him during his shift and it seems he is expecting me to just give her beers so i start a tab under his name for the craft beers she has several more and he gets off and asks for a rail whiskey with ginger ale which he would only order as a shift drink otherwise he would drink top shelf and another while i did give him his deserved shift drink they eventually rang up a tab and when i reminded him to take care of the tab before they left and presented him with the bill he gave me a look like wtf man they studied the bill and i explained the shift drink rules he continues to argue that he should get at least shift drinks and i remind him that he only ordered drink that could have qualified the rail whiskey and reminded him of the rules while he did pay his tab it was grudgingly and he left no tip she ended up paying for all her own drinks and left a great tip and left without him i saw him trying to pick up sleazy girls for the rest of the night with no success he was too drunk by then tipping goes a long way in the service industry dont tip me dont get laid 
id love to take credit for this but my friend was actually the evil genius back in college my buddy and i worked at one of those goofy shit on the walls amp mozzarella sticks type of corporate american restaurants the managers made shitty salaries so they relied heavily on performance based yearend bonuses one of the key performance measures was cost control meaning theyd get bonuses if they could keep their operating costs under certain levels unfortunately all of the managers were mean bitter broken people who took their lifes frustrations out on the staff none of us liked working for them but we put up with it out of necessity one day im at work and i notice my buddy drop a steak knife into the trash can as hes clearing off plates at the dish washing station i figure its an accident so i reach into the trash to pull it back out but he grabs my wrist and says no leave it i give him a puzzled look after looking around to make sure nobody is listening he leans in and whispers ive been doing it for weeks every time one of the managers insults me or pisses me off i throw something in the trash knives full condiment bottlesnothing big and nothing that we the staff would desperately miss but enough to affect their costs it helps me deal with their bullshit knowing im hitting them where it hurts realizing the brilliance of this tactic i followed his lead that year they missed out on a good part of their bonuses and of the managers quit its still the most satisfying revenge ive ever gotten
i dont know what compelled you to take over two minutes to slowly back out of your spot blocking traffic while on your phone maybe it was your smug sense of superiority maybe you like making people wait did you like it when i did a uturn cut through some vacant spots and beat you to the only exit did you like it when i took two minutes to slowly turn onto an empty road while pretending to be on my phone i am an angry man
hey dennis i never had the balls to tell you this because you probably would have punched me in the face to everyone else reading dennis has been in and out of prison for over half of his life now he just got out from a two year sentence for attempting to burn my house down he is muslim and follows his religion very strictly while while in prison when he is out he only follows what is convenient for him dennis remember that morning you decided to make me breakfast in bed you know the day after you broke my arm i told you there was turkey bacon in the fridge because you dont eat pork well there really was turkey bacon in the fridge but i guess there was a mix up because you came to bed with a big ass pile of pork bacon i can see how you confused the two because the turkey bacon was in strips while the real bacon was the bits and ends pieces instead of the widely known strips i didnt say a fucking word when you handed me my plate and then brought in your own plate piled much higher than mine partly because you had already been chewing on pork while you were walking in and partly because i hated your fucking guts and couldnt wait for you to disappear haha you even mentioned how greasy it was for turkey bacon hahaha you fucking piece of shit update questions answered feel free to skip this part there are also questions answered and detailed stories in the comments the comments may be more descriptive than these answered questions so this isnt too long plus im sick of thinking about this shit head i really appreciate all the support howwhy did you start dating this person i was at the age of he stopped me while walking down main street i had never gotten this kind of attention before and i was very flattered my father was never around and dennis was literally the first person to call me beautiful i felt special in a way i never experienced before he was very persistent in getting my number it was very exciting to me because he was older he told me he was but he was really he was well aware i was i made that very clear when youre young its so awesome to be hit on by an older person it makes you feel more mature than your age very special but beware there is something mentally wrong with a man who only want young young women you need to ask yourself why cant he have a relationship with someone his age were there red flags when you look back on it yes the first one was after four months of knowing him other than a partying habit he bought me alcohol and we got drunk together still he didnt take me to his home which i thought was weird turned out he didnt have a home we were in a park the middle of the night i was on top of him and clothes were going off we had complete privacy just want to make that clear i never seen him without his hat on when i took it off his extreme hair line showed i knew then that he was lying about his age i was grossed out by it but it helped being drunk because it was too late by then im sure there were a shit load of red flags i didnt see i was naive i didnt ask him questions at all i was too worried about being cool enough for him i found out his past charges when i was already pregnant to which he later admitted to trying to get me pregnant of course he is not fully to blame but he shouldnt have told me that when he was arrested for drugs he called me from jail immediately the next morning i got a call from a detective telling me i sounded young and he would really like to talk to me in person i didnt go but he told me over the phone he was a sex offender and his extensive history red flag i was pregnant and after freaking out he explained himself so well it was bad circumstances and the world was out to get him he never did anything wrong promise promise when did it become physical well i became pregnant just after turning he was in prison the entire pregnancy for drug charges it was a good thing he was locked up i gave up the baby for adoption he was really against it when he got out of prison baby about three months old we had a little honey moon phase after a year of love letters in a few months he left his facebook open and a message popped up it was a women so it sparked my curiosity went into his messages and found so many women some very young some in their late thirtiesugly women fat women pretty like a model women rave girls even lesbians i couldnt believe he had the time to talk to all these women he claimed to be single i confronted him and he flipped out about me invading privacy he punched me repeatedly in the face two black eyes bloody nose and a sleepy head like wham out of no where i couldnt believe it and i wasnt even the one who fucked up i got a broken nose from that the cartilage is permanently damaged my nose will forever be just a tiny bit lop sided unless i decide to have corrective surgery i wont be doing that cause its not that bad why did you stay with him after he became abusive because he had so much sorrow or so i thought man he really knew how to put on the water works he cried way more than i ever did in his defense im not that emotional he said he blacked out its from trauma in prison his fight or flight mode to which i asked so if i ever become pregnant again im not safe no i would never hit a pregnant woman well if you had a choice whyd you hit me in the first place he cries and cries got down on his knees and grabbed my ankles begging for forgiveness with the loss of our baby i was always trying to prove that i loved her i always loved her but i felt like staying with him would somehow prove to her that i loved her very much and i didnt just want to get rid of her plus you know everyone gets a second chance all very stupid reasons how long did you stay together we were off and on of course but i need to make it clear that over of our relationship was while he was in prison our whole relationship is a huge stack of letters i keep in the garage for my daughter i loved him when he was in prison it was perfect he couldnt cheat with women lol and i was just always faithful he wasnt in a place to scare me away or argue he was the best boyfriend on paper id say we were together maybe two years give or take eating pork without knowing its pork is not wrong or his fault well that is not the petty revenge the revenge is him reading this post and realizing that he stuffed his face like a pig full of pork if he knew i sat there watching him eat it smiling on the inside he would have tried to murder me he is an extremely prideful boy he hates feeling disrespected i think its because he is very short about we call that short man syndrome as popular as this post has become i am very hopeful he will see this i will definitely let yall know if i find out he does when you found out his past and how much time he spent in prison did you rethink being with him yes i even told him i didnt think it would work out when i was first pregnant but the love letters got me so persistent this fuck every second i was with dennis i was rethinking it it never felt right unless he was in prison and when he was in prison i never got to see him or be with him two different people i never ever stopped rethinking i remember a lot of times when with him in person it was almost like someone else jumped into my body and started evaluating my life with fresh eyes id look at him and think who is this person what is it i see in him why do i stay am i happy ewww hes about to kiss you act natural when did you start fearing for your safety i talked to one of his exes on the phone she was not even a baby mama she made it a point to find me and talk to me she told me to get out and get out fast when she left him he went crazy on her he said he wanted to pick his things up from her apartment and when she refused to take him back he literally tried to bite her face off like an animal she got stitches and her left cheek is scarred up pretty bad that disturbed me to the core that is when i started to worry about getting out alive i later found out he secretly got all my friends numbers and my families too he would gain so much information he could use against me just shit he would throw me under the bus for whatever he had he would use whenever i told him it was over he would call my friends and family and tell them anything negative he had luckily everyone thought he was crazy for doing that and wouldnt look down on me for the negative things they would be happy i was getting away but the fact he was willing to do that showed how deep he was willing to go it concerned me and scared me dennis does not sound like a muslim namehe doesnt sound muslim to me dennis is white he was not raised in islam when he went to prison as a young sex offender he decided to become muslim i think it was survival for him and living over half his life in prison with nothing better to do i think he started to really believe he was muslim i do not think he was invested when he began but eventually he became his habits and his surrounding brothers prayed five times a day fasted during ramadan followed muslim diet read the quran every day he even speaks fluent arabic that is commitment while i am no one to judge he eventually loses these habits when outside of prison he tries but he strays he follows what is convenient for him but wont listen to anything you have to say about it its really sad because he shames the religion and i dont think it to be a shame at all while i dont believe or practice it is he still in your life no well mostly he recently very recently was just released from prison a two year sentence for attempted arson he tried to burn my house down while i was asleep in it we expected him to get ten years throughout his stay in prison he called me every once in a while i have a stalking order against him for the rest of my life now that hes out i get a lot of hang up calls and little threats like im coming for you ive changed my number six times now and i dont know how he keeps getting my number i dont know if he is getting it from one of my good friends i dont know if his mother is helping him she works in the government thats all i know i just have no clue maybe he goes directly through phone company who knows have you considered getting a fire arm not really i actually think that would be more dangerous than beneficial dennis is physically stronger than me he is really good at getting whatever you got in your hand to use against him before you can even think about using it i believe if he ever got the chance he would use a gun to kill me he doesnt care about life in prison i have had a tazor and phone in my hand and he grabs it so quick that being said i feel pretty comfortable and prepared i have pepper spray hidden in every major room i have updated fire alarms and i finally got adt along with surveillance cameras i think the cameras would be enough to scare him off any day of the week hes probably already scoped the house out and noticed them havent been bothered at all he does not want to be caught on camera how do you feel about muslims now nobody actually asked this question but i wanted to make this clear i think this religion has very beautiful aspects to it while i do not agree with everything when i see somebody who is muslim i do not think anything negative because of my unfortunate experience i know dennis life is a fucking joke he would make believing in air look bad when i see someone who is muslim i have respect in what they believe there is a beautiful life there and im glad i got the chance to learn about this religion i dont consider myself a religious while i believe anything is possible i enjoy learning all beliefs i believe whatever the great answer is it is something that we cannot comprehend that or it is so simple we are all over thinking it just saying what does your life look like now i am with somebody who is wonderful to me i love him with all my heart he has taught me very many things we are the same age group and expecting a baby boy within the next three weeks i am very happy with my life now and i am very happy to be starting my new family with this wonderful best friend of mine what have you learned cmon what have you learned again thanks for all the support people didnt expect this post to be so popular because it really is petty lol if i had known id be explaining so much shit id probably make a less interesting title i probably wont be answering anymore questions because i am sick of this subject however if my petty revenge becomes complete you all will be the first to know
i know the title makes me sound horrible but let me explain last xmas my father got my brother my nephew and myself new tablets for gifts and my brother took it upon himself to register them all under his name and email now mine is broken and i have asked him repeatedly to help get it fixed but he refuses because he doesnt want to bother helping me with any problems that concern me i have tried to put in a warranty claim myself but being that theu are registered to his email i cant do anything without him so i called the company and explained that he set them up i then told them that he died and asked that they transfer all the warranty information to my account so while i didnt technically physically harm my brother i told a company that he was dead so that i could get around his lack of help im probably going to hell for that among other things but at this point i just want whats mine to work the way it is supposed to
four college buddies of a cousin of mine are on a cross country road trip and i allowed them to crash at my place last night we caught a basketball game stopped off for a beer they stayed out i went home i was asleep by midnight they closed down the bars went to an afterhours cop bar and then caught a cab home at about theyre twentysomething asshats so i expected loud and drunk strike one i did not expect or appreciate them waking me up to tell me all the cool stuff they did strike two they could not contain their laughter as they each walked into my bedroom farted and left i went down to the kitchen to see what was causing all the noise drunk fuckers were trying to make eggs strike three they had opened and were drinking a very nice bottle of wine that i had been saving for a special occasion me get the fuck out of my kitchen ill cook some food a few weeks ago i made some black bean and beef chili im not sure what made it gastrointestinally lethal but it was so good that i froze the remainder freezing and recooking did not make it less lethal this was perhaps the best tasting chili ive ever made however six to eight hours after ingestion the bloat begins an hour after that intestinal cramps a short while later its like shermans march to the sea with intestines screaming everybody get the fuck out its about a three hour tour of explosive diarrhea preceded by farts that smell like rotten eggs and a skunk fucking a burning tire in addition i was such a good host that i served a bunch of eggs and some three month old unpasteurized unfiltered apple cider terrible terrible things were about to happen in their gut well at least for three out of the four one guys a vegan hell still suffer though fuck vegans they were done eating by napped until about and were back on the road by got a text from my cousin wondering what time they left they should have nearly made it to his place in nyc by now but alas they were still miles away i called my cousin to get the details about minutes into the trip the cars interior became so toxic they had to stop and let it sit for a while with the doors open in windy f weather a few minutes later it became a race to a bathroom two made it one couldnt and had to perform the roadside dropandsquat over snow with improvised toilet paper tldr revenge is a dish best served warm smelly and far away
so about two months ago i made a big life change from being a server at a restaurant to being a school teacher until i got a few pay checks under my belt i subletted at a house with some good friends i worked with i dont have a room tho just the den on the first floor with just a curtain as privacy noise is a problem thing is servers and teachers pretty much have opposite schedules theyre home at im up at the sleep at i sleep at not to mention i have real weekends when their saturday might be a monday but again i did this too so i totally get it at first they would get home and play music and be fucking loud like not just talking but yelling shit id go tell them to be quiet and they would except for one chick who doesnt understand having a conscience at first i was nice and the two good roommates were completely receptive monday night i wake up at midnight to loud music and like people over i just kind of call in hey would you mind keeping it down and they did quickly awesome except two hours later the loud one is fucking some midget douche on our couch and bumping tunes while doing so i was pissed but not outwardly angry i just yelled fuck him upstairs and passed out the next day we talked about it she apologized and we moved on last night shes having some dramas at in the fucking morning that i couldnt give two shits about shes yelling freaking out and then calls in randomly sorry notreallyajew to which i respond if youre really sorry youll shut up and go to bed well didnt this cause a fucking shitshow shes yelling at me blacked out i realize as usual and is overall being i believe the websters term for it is a bitch so this morning rolls around and i wake up at shes sleeping on the couch so what do i do i normally put on my shoes last but today i put them on first and spent alllllll my time stomping like an asshole oh that floorboard creaks lets walk along all of it oh my coffee needs stirring lets clink the glass times to make sure its good and mixed im making a sandwich that jar of jelly just wont unstick even after banging it on the counter morning stretches how about some high knees to get the leg juices flowing and the icing on the cake was walking out the front door slamming it then forgetting my coffee and i had to do the whole thing again best part was after the second time all i hear walking to my car is i get it i drove off into the sunrise edit conscious aware of and responding to ones surroundings awake conscience an inner feeling or voice viewed as acting as a guide to the rightness or wrongness of ones behavior
i work at an upscale restaurant that is half bar last night a group of pretty well dressed women in their thirties strolled in about and demanded a food menu when i explained that our kitchen closes at midnight one of them angrily pointed at another table and screeched well they have food when i tell them that that particular table ordered their food twenty minutes prior and that is why they in fact have food on their table she waved me away telling me to ask the kitchen what they can do the kitchen relents and the ladies get a hummus i set it down and they descend upon it nary a thank you they dont order anything else and i keep enough of an eye on them to make sure they are taken care of without me actually having to interact with them more than i have to the last time i check up on them asking if they need anything i get a curt no five minutes later theyre gone my annoyance turns to glee when i go to clear the table one of them has left behind her iphone i drop it into my apron and walk up to a guy that i saw chatting them up earlier and ask if he knew them he tells me no that they were horrendously bitchy and that he got the fuck out of that situation as soon as possible i tell him my experience with them and he asks how much their bill was it was he then shoves into my hand telling me hell cover it and i can keep the rest i try to refuse it since it wasnt his fault that they walked out but he insists i go to the office and explain the situation to my manager who is as pissed off as i am when one of the womans friends calls the phone my manger answers it up and tells her that she is welcome to come by to pick up the phone and pay her tab otherwise she will have to wait until monday at pm to get it were closed on sunday if it had been any other customer we would have worked something out to get her phone to her earlier but fuck her well apparently this woman has a friend who knows one of our bartenders this friend calls our bartender who im fairly close with and knew about the situation asking if he could bring the phone to her on sunday he tells her no that the woman skipped out on her bill and will need to personally come in to get her phone the woman never came in that night so basically this woman will have to come back into the restaurant she essentially stole from is going to be without her phone until tomorrow and looked like a complete twat in front her friend in the process bet you wish you paid that tab now bitch update the bartender relented and brought the woman her phone on sunday night on the condition that she pay her tab according to him she was a huge entitled bitch who just shoved a at him and didnt apologize for skipping out on the bill and yes i could have thrown the phone away but i felt like that was a bit much i think the inconvenience of having to go nearly hours without her phone and the embarrassment of acting like a complete shithead was punishment enough
 after a very eventful week in which i missed work because i was extremely ill i finally returned to my hallowed spot behind the register since the winter is mighty slow for us i guess one of my bosses got antsy and decided to tweak our pos settings so new and fun things printed out on our receipt in hindsight it really was my fault for leaving her unattended with the register for a week one of these new and fun things happened to include the receipt now printing the first and last name of the cashier who rang them up im not a crazy privacy nut but this this freaked me out and pissed me off the receipt already prints out our employee code when we ring the sale i called my boss and asked her what pos option she had fiddled it so i could fiddle it back to off imagine my shock at her shock on why i would want to do this what is so bad about the receipt printing the first and last name of the cashier oh i dont know irate customers having personal information crazy customers having personal information any customer having personal information the list goes on my first and last name are one google search away from my address my facebook my embarrassing angstriddled teenage blogs that i keep meaning to delete my boss told me to leave the option turned on so i created a fake facebook account using a male name and sent her a private message detailing how i thought she was so pretty and how i was too shy to say that when she rang me up but i got her name off the receipt and just had to contact her two hours after i sent the message she called me and told me to turn the option off
worked at golds gym for a while back in the day refused to be promoted multiple times i just liked working there and my free membership no responsibilities just whatever shoot the shit with people whatever plus i had a real job and made good money doing other shit noticed one day that safe in the office isnt bolted the floor someone can literally just pick it up and walk off with it or just turn it upside down and shake shit out of it it had a top drop thing i point this out to the gm maybe you all should bolt that shit down someone could just walk off with it or turn it over no one else was around just thought he should consider it since managers never lock the office door and its right where everyone walks to the lockers and out the doors and there are no cameras seems like a bad idea we had heads a day through the door he writes me up i was like what dude this is a bullshit job i dont give a fuck about this job and i still do it better than anyone you are gonna write me up for pointing out you should bolt your safe to the floor yup alright motherfucker i told every single person i would shoot the shit with at the front desk about our conversation this equated to about people per shift few hundred over the next week or so guess what happened word got around the following week someone walked off with the safe i laughed in my bosses fucking face and told him to try to have me arrestedfired and watch me ruin his career when i sue him golds and clown his ass in the media that was the end of that conversation they got a new safe and it was bolted to the ground golds gym is such a fucking shit show
the setup so i was doing apartment tours last year and they took me to this great place it is a killer location and the apartment is in the basement of this awesome house that everyone always talks about great rent is doable and so i hop on it i asked the typical inquiries and if there was anything else i should know nope ok lets do it i rent the place well i move in early and everything is going swimmingly then two weeks in my neighbors all move in great meet new people well turns out that the entire rest of the house had been rented to a fraternity so now im living in the basement of a house where there are parties multiple nights a week people yelling and playing beer pong till all hours of the night fuck see theyre all nice to me and im ok with noise ive been there before so i just deal with it earplugs headphones i just really wouldve liked to have known what i was getting into so i couldve considered other places the revenge well now it is apartment tour season again and i just had a striking young law school prospect coming by to check out the place he walks around asks the normal questions then turns and asks hows the noise yes the moment ive been waiting for save some sap from unknowingly fucking up his sleep schedule i say yeah its damn loud i tell him that maybe it is not bad when there isnt a rowdy group upstairs so id figure out who was renting before you commit he asks the person giving the tour and she sighs and goes yeah theyve renewed its a fraternity she hadnt told him wouldnt have told him if i wasnt there most likely im going to inform every person that comes through here how bad the noise is good luck renting this place out with me giving accurate and valid information to prospective tenants who you wouldve otherwise misled ya dicks tldr rent me into a frat basement without telling me i will wait for every apartment tour and thwart your fucking over of other people deal with it edit based on a few responsesmessages i will clarify that the guys upstairs are all very kind and i have nothing against them they are simply seeking to have a good time during their college years the revenge is strictly landlord oriented 
so earlier today i was crossing the street when some douchebag started honking at me when he was trying to make a left it was out of nowhere and i had the right of way i was walking at a brisk pace since i was running a bit late to an interview across said street i would have been out of his way in seconds but he decides to honk at me multiple times i do not know this person and he stared at me with a straight face the whole time i had seconds left on the light so i proceeded to fix my tie check my phone and shine my shoe while the guy kept laying on the horn light turns yellow and without looking at him i literally skip to the street i am a fat guy so it was hilarious i enter the building straight ahead and get in the elevator a man and his group asks if i can hold the elevator so i did when he gets in he tells me dont worry we wont honk at you we talk about what just happened and how the guy was totally red we were all laughing i tell him how i was running late but that it was totally worth it we get out of the elevator on the same floor as i said goodbye i approached the receptionist to ask where the interview was taking place she asks the person behind me who was the man in the elevator turns out he was the one hiring for the office position he on the spot tells me youre hired i start tomorrow tldr driver honks at me unprovoked i troll him then get a job offer edit grammar 
i drove an old sedan when i was a teen when the horn stopped making any sound above a dry wheeze i went to the auto parts store to replace it to my delight the only horn available was a twotone air horn like the ones on semi trucks i loved it because it confused the everloving shit out of people i would honk and they would go crazy whipping their heads around looking for the wheeler nope it was little ol me in my dinky little honda accord you just cut off jerkface one day i pulled up to the end of a long line of cars at my favorite drivethru burger joint i waited many long hungry minutes for the several cars ahead of me to order the last one had moved up i was taking my foot off the brake ready to finally make it around that last bend to the menu kiosk and place my order for my juicy delicious burger when a car came hauling ass through the parking lot screeching to a halt to edge in line ahead of me i wasnt moving at breakneck speed but i wasnt making room for another car and there was clearly a line at least one more car sat waiting behind me there is no way she didnt know what she was doing i honked a couple of times you jerk thing is once you get around that corner where the menu board order kiosk thingy is youre stuck in that lane you cant pull around the cars in front of you and you cant back up if there is someone behind you then realized that this asshole might get her lunch before me but she also couldnt go anywhere i pressed the horn and didnt let go people walking out of the front door saw me holding down this veritable fog horn at full blast and howling with laughter it was fantastic she leaned as far as she could out the window but she couldnt get her order through until she opened her car door stepped out leaned over and got her face a couple of inches from the intercom yelling at the top of her lungs i gleefully watched her struggle she didnt even turn to look at me she knew what she did and she knew she fucking deserved it eventually the line moved again and i got to place my order i also made sure i got off the horn when the person behind me pulled up to the kiosk and rolled down their window to order but otherwise i was blasting it until she drove off which she did at the same pace she arrived tires screeching had a good laugh about it with the guy at the window enjoyed the bajeezus out of that burger to this day i get a justice boner thinking about it good maude that was satisfying 
earlier today a customer approached me about grabbing something out of willcall i wasnt busy so i pulled up his order printed a pick list and told him ill be back after locating the items i realized i didnt have the proper cart to bring them out i walk out to grab one and on my way back in he stops me and asks do i have to wait an hour i make him repeat his question and probably realizing im not taking any of his shit he mumbles it out i ask why do you think youre going to wait that long while still looking him dead in the eyes im getting them right now why do you think you have to wait an hour he doesnt answer i grab his items bring them out and instead of bringing them closer to the entranceexit as i usually do i bring the cart all the way to the furthest computer on the desk to close out his order i print out his receipt make him sign and before he was done signing for it i had already turned my back to him to start helping another customer didnt offer to help him load it up it was a fancy delicate glass door that i intentionally stood up on the cart instead of laying down or thank him hope you crack the glass as youre loading it up you fuck tldr customer was being a sarcastic douche so i made him push an awkward cart an extra feet
a bit of background i work in an east coast supermarket chain no not that one as a front end cashier our store stops accepting new customers at and closes at after this we have to break down the aisles and clean so we all leave around ten if this schedule is disturbed we all go home much later onto the revenge it was a thursday night and our store was running at a decent pace up until about where only a few customers remained at a customer walks up c with two carts of groceries overflowing onto the floor as she dragged them along behind her she has been a regular and does this same thing every time she comes in even the managers complain about her weve always talked about teaching her a lesson and such because she is just so nasty as well she walks up to me and says youd better look a little more lively than that i dont want to be here all night she began to haphazardly toss all her groceries across the belt in no order whatsoever i looked over to my bagger and she looked like someone just killed her puppy but i had an idea her groceries needed to be sorted and carefully placed in carriages to avoid anything at all from being crushed right just to give an estimation a normal transaction runs about minutes we made hers last about we sorted everything into sections by item type and then by subcategory after each section i stopped and waited for my bagger to finish and would carefully review the last section to check for any double scanned items or incorrect prices after about two sections she began tapping her foot and sighing frequently c would you just hurry up me im just doing my best to make sure your order is correct retail smile c let me talk to your manager smartass i call over the asm and continue carefully and precisely ring the order c look what hes doing this is outrageous i mean its and i have places i need to be do you know who i am etc etc asm hes just doing his job and very well i might add you should come in earlier next time have a good evening maam c sounds you would expect from a rabid dog i can see shes paying with a check so while she is chewing out the poor asm i quickly remove the strip of ink from the printer and finish her order me ok the total comes to how would you like to pay c check and youre lucky im paying at all me im so sorry you feel that way i take her check and place it in the printer oh no it doesnt work me looks like were going to have to take you to another register maam our check printer is acti c ill just pay cash me okay so sorry retail smile i slowly count her change mightve lost count a couple times and wish her a night as wonderful as she is we all stayed late that night but no one complained even once edit thanks for the gold im so glad to be able to share the amazing feeling of old fashioned petty revenge with you all
i lived in a unit apartment building in midtown detroit near a university the place was old built in the cost was low the walls were stucko and the cockroaches didnt pay rent essentially just about all of the residents were working a shitty full time job somewhere and the few students who did live there worked even harder essentially all of us there worked to afford our life as opposed to riding daddys dime through college that was the case with the exception of one unit that unit housed one or two football players who didnt really take life seriously this specific incident others happened later and one kid managed to add a felony mark to his record but i digress i was leaving for work the morning after one of their weekday parties and noticed that one of their guests had pissed on my car i dont like having my car pissed on the entire day i stewed about it at work and then drove home then it happened there was the little shit who lives in that apartment walking in the alley to a class or something please note that i have never directly let him know i have a problem with him or been anything other than friendly i stop kinda blocking his path and said hello in an enthusiastically happy way he returned my greeting and i told him to go ahead and get in my car id be happy to dive him to campus to save him some time he jumped at the opportunity it was time for our heart to heart and to explain that cars are not urinals now i know this guy a little there are two ways this is going to play out hell apologize for his guest and possibly offer some reasurances that hell be proactive at preventing douchebaggary rather unlikely but theres a chance ooooor hell be a little shit about it if option i was planning on thanking him for taking us his neighbors into future consideration with his events drop him off at the closest point to his destination as possible and not ever tell him that his friend had used my passengerside door handle as the urinal but he chose option and i was elated about it i start to talk to him about the party he kinda defends himself with huffs and disinterest i continue to talk about it and begin to work to rial him up it worked like a charm he started getting pissed that id hold him accountable for his guests actions in fact he got distracted enough that he didnt realize that i had taken a roundabout route and after about seven minutes or so was about to drop him off exactly where i had picked him up as he was getting out he said well i dont see how thats my problem and slams my door wow i cant believe my luck i return through the open window its your problem because he pissed all over the handle you used to get into my car the kid stuttersteps and looks back right at the door handle that showed the dust rinsed off by urine something he hadnt noticed on the way into my car then looked at his hand and his face changed it was a beautiful change it changed from fuck you im a dick to a look of realizing that i had him fucked from the getgo it was defeat it was beautiful it was glorious that was and is a very satisfying moment i always smile when i remember it edit formatting and tldr tldr jock neighbors friend pissed on my cars passenger side door handle i got the jock to use the handle when the guy refused to apologize i made sure he knew he rubbed his hand in it and that i had wasted about seven minutes of his life

dear shopping cart lady you suddenly walked in front of my car as my car was on and as i was trying to pull out of my parking space you parked your cart in front of my car and started putting your items in your trunk its cool i thought to myself youll move your cart when youre done you just didnt see me or something but you dont you leave your cart there start to walk back into the store then turn around and go straight into your car where you sit and text yes i got out of my car and moved the cart behind you and when i looked out my rear view mirror as i drove away seeing you back straight into the shopping cart was the best sense of satisfaction ive felt all day no love me
in my thursday morning class i have a professor who has no business teaching she is volatile and rude and very easily offended today she was talking about some event on campus that i wasnt interested in so i turned on my monitor computer lab class and pulled up my grades then i pulled out my planner and began making notes of upcoming assignments all of a sudden shes standing right next to me i said yes and she said this is my class and im speaking turn off your monitor and put your things away i said well im writing school related things in my planner and checking my grades and she said youre being disruptive to my lecture ok whatever it wasnt even class related it was about a campus event shes the one wasting time by stopping class and micromanaging what im doing but fine i did as she asked then she went on to address the class and said i dont know why you kids think you can act this way i told you since the first day of class to keep your monitors off and show me respect when im teaching this really fucking pissed me off she was making a big deal out of a small thing and referring to us as kids was just demeaning im most of my classmates are older commuter students two are over forty this class is only six students and normally i do a lot of talking and contributing because im the only person in the class looking to go specifically into this field and it just really interests me right then i decided i wasnt going to say a fucking word she continued with two hours of lecturing constantly asking questions and wanting to have discussions but being met with dead silence and awkward stares a few people said one or two things but it was basically just her asking questions to the empty air a few times she even looked right at me and said moonranger what do you think and id just say its good or i agree or some shit by the end of class there was so much tension no one would talk to her and she looked super uncomfortable fuck yea mission accomplished was the silent treatment petty youre goddamn right it was and it felt so good 
back in the days when my sister lived with me we shared a bathroom this girl though i love her dearly had a serious problem with taking and using my possessions without asking it drove me absolutely up the wall she had very long thick hair so whenever she had a shower she decided that she needed two towels one for her body and one for her hair rather than keep an extra towel she would just use mine as well every single time this girl would also have her shower just before me so id come in to find my towel soaking wet so as a reasonable mature adult i decided to keep my towel in my bedroom instead however i also left a decoy towel in the bathroom on my hook and every time i went for a shower id use it as a bathmat knowing that my sister would never know my feet had marched over that decoy towel she constantly stole to wrap her hair in the best part she has an extreme disgust for feet
so i went through all her shows on netflix hells kitchen as an example and fast forwarded all of them until it was right on the part wherever a chef went home or gave away the ending on all her other shows update she went to watch her shows last night on hulu opened it up and i heard chef blah blah hand me your jacket and then a giant wtf from the living room i just smiled to myself in my room hopefully she watches something else and it happens again
my apartment complex has an entry gate that requires you to enter a code the bad thing is the gate opens from right to left meaning that you have to wait until the gate is all the way open before entering common courtesy dictates that the person who opened the gate goes first but some impatient prick didnt get that memo as soon as the gate is halfway open he drives by everyone else in line to get in first the first time he did this i gave him the benefit of the doubt maybe he really had to go to the bathroom or something but he does this all the time my solution i park in the center of the entrance drive and get out of my truck to enter the code and still wait for the gate to fully open before entering if im not the one opening the gate i still wait in the center giving him no room to pass on the right
snotty little knowitall has gotten up from the break room table many times and just left her garbage there for the sweet elderly cleaning lady to deal with at end of shift i noticed the other day that princess doesnt have a lock on her locker so i stuffed her nasty lean cuisine garbage apple core and empty yogurt container in it after she left 
this happened when i was traveling with a girl friend in europe last year we went out dining at this local pub near our hostel i was using the loo to do no last night dinner didnt sit well with me so my friend was sitting alone at the table eating her meal as weve been lunching at the same pub for few days in a row the bartender have gotten used to us and were even on some sort of friendly terms with him on this said day i told him ill pick up the tab for our meals before i went to the loo while she was eating two guys walked in and sat near our table they were loud and obnoxious they were also making fun of my friend shes a chinese and im an asian as well but by some lucky genes dont look as much of an asian i can actually pass as a brown skin person by making racist remarks about asians stuffs like slit eyes skin tone and asian being second class world citizens when i was washing my hand at the sink my friend walked up to me and whisper about what happened she told me shes gonna make a quick dash to the convenience store around the corner to grab some stuffs she went out through the other door so its positive that these two guys didnt see her with me i went back to our usual spot and start ordering one of the guys keep giving me this flirtatious wink and at one point came up to me start striking up a conversation i finish my meal as soon as i can and when i was about to pay he stopped me and said lunch on me love so he paid for both of our meals so imagine his reaction when my friend walked into the bar looking for me and we started conversing in our mother tongue that guys face were priceless he looked utterly uncomfortable and before we left i told him loud and clear that he just tried hitting on an asian girl thanks for the meal btw edit well i didnt expect this blow up it happened in amsterdam but i dont think the two guys were dutch btw you netherland people are friendly and for those who who wonder where i came from we are a bag of culturally very mixed asian asian does not extend to just chinese indian theres thai philippines indonesian malaysian vietnamese cambodian etc etc and for some reason or previous ancestors might came from many different races i ended up not looking much like an asian even in my own country i have been mistaken by expats asking if im italian spanish all of my siblings have been mistaken the same as well im just saying by some mixed up genes i look racially ambiguous that when i travel outside of my country people dont throw racist remarks to me as asian compare to what my other friends go through thats all folks edit reading through the comments i realised some are making it feels like im proud not to look like asian apologize if i did so im proud to be known as asian what i mean is by some very mixed up genes i dont look much like asian which works for me when it comes to travel and the line of work im in something for you to imagine my sister looked like serafina from hollywood cycle yep that hated trainee
this petty revenge took place at my university in sweden i was sitting in the computer lab doing some school work and surfing reddit the building was pretty desolate because it was around pm on a friday after working for a while i felt the need to use a bathroom so i locked my computer got up and started walking toward the exit of the computer lab as i was about to walk out i saw a very beautiful woman lets call her her sb short for snobby bitch through the glass window of the door walking toward the computer lab i opened the door and held it open for her all of a sudden she stopped walking and gave me a frustrated look i politely asked are you going in she angrily replied i can open the door by myself you idiot so i walked out the door turned around and closed the door behind me so she had to open it by herself then i walked away and went to the bathroom when i returned i saw that she was still standing outside of the computer lab and she was looking at me with an apologetic smile i immediately realized what had happened to unlock the door for the computer lab from the outside you need to swipe your student card and enter a pincode she had most likely forgot her student card or her pincode so she was hoping that i would open the door for her but instead i turned around walked around the computer lab and used another door to get into the computer lab then i sat down next my computer and continued with my school work since the doors have glass windows she was able to see me sitting in the computer lab she started knocking on the door apologizing and pleading for me to open the door after a minute or two she realized that i wasnt going to open the door for her she walked away but returned ten minutes later she had most likely gone to the other computer labs but returned when she saw that nobody were in them she started knocking on the door again and asking if i could open it for her but stopped after a minute and just stood there staring at me with an angry face after a few minutes i started feeling sorry for her but just as i was about to get up to open the door another woman walked by sb stopped her and asked if she could open the door for her so she swiped her card entered her pincode opened the door for sb and walked away as sb entered she gave me a mean look but i just looked at her with a shiteating grin and asked oh i thought you could open the door by yourself she just replied with a pff and sat down next to a computer tldr i held a door open for someone who got mad at me for doing so so i closed the door to let her open it by herself she wasnt able to open it so somebody else had to do it for her
where i work the parking can be pretty brutal theres no excuse for it since there are two two overflow car parks and theres always plenty of space in the second one but i guess some people dont want to walk the extra few hundred metres so theyll park in the most ridiculous places i get back to my car at about pm tired and hungry and ready to go home and some asshole has parked his car behind me not enough to stop me from getting about but enough that i have to make fucking maneuvers doing it when i was done getting out of the space i stopped and got out a pad of paper and a pen from my work bag and slipped a note under his windshield the note it just says sorry have fun looking for the damage asshole 
i live in a small suburban neighborhood its fairly quiet lots of families decent but small yards my next door neighbor built a fire pit in his back yard for weekend bonfirebeer parties with his friends not a huge deal right no this thing has a foot radius and is about ft from my house still not a huge deal until he loads the pit up so theres a huge pile of brush and wood ft high which then makes a giant fire im always worried these drunk asses will set my house on fire and have asked them several times to just not make their fire so huge the flames lick the power lines running to my house so these flames are up like ft i could technically call the cops or fire department on them but i got petty as fuck instead i had a bunch of leftover firecrackers from july th i made about nice little bundles and put them in plastic baggies i then snuck into his yard in the middle of the night and buried the baggies in the fire pits dirt month later i see them gathering for another bud lite fueled fire and i wait half and hour later i hear firecrackers going off and see one of them dive to the ground because of how i buried them they kept going off every minutes confusing the shit out of them they kept checking their wood pile as if there was something wrong with the fire wood havent had a bonfire since then and that was almost a year ago
so i got this guy over to my lift we were short staffed so we had a guy at the top and me at the bottom with this new guy on his first day of training for the first hours were both at the bottom and this new kid was doing great he picked up the job almost instantly the only issue i had with him at that point was that he was cocky as hell and seemed to think that within hours he had become the greatest lift operator in history even going so far as to lecture me on things he thought i was doing wrong before this whole first hours i taught him how to start the lift on this lift part of the opening procedure was checking the reading on the hydraulic pressure gauge on the tensioning system this involved climbing up a foot ladder and walking across a catwalk above the loading area this was the only thing the kid had a hard time with as it was obvious he was badly afraid of heights for the next hours he was constantly running his mouth and acting like hes ready for everything making my job of training him much harder but the whole time i was just constantly thinking about the sweet sweet justice that was soon to unfurl eventually some of the afternoon shift guys came over so they were able to take care of the new guy and the lift while i took my lunch break i got back and could tell after half an hour that the afternoon guys already couldnt stand this cocky idiot although he did the job well enough that they just left it all on him at this point the guy said something along the lines of i could run this whole lift myself and something about the other guys being dumb as bricks this is when i asked him if he was ready to go up up he says which i replied with well yea the guy at the top wants to take his break so lets go up there and ill train you on that the top yea you did notice youve been running a chairlift all day now we have to go up to the other end of it you mean we have to ride this thing his jaw dropped and it looked like he just took a punch to the face so i got another guy to take over bumping chairs while the two of us went for a fun little journey to the top a ride i had been waiting hours for were maybe feet off the ground when he grabs the safety bar slams it down and is sitting whiteknuckled in fear as we climb to our eventual altitude of feet above the snow although it can give a false perspective appearing higher this kid is absolutely terrified meanwhile im just sitting back enjoying a cigarette the lift stopped as it often does and despite the fact that he himself had stopped this lift countless times earlier he started freaking out why did we stop what the fuck is going on here this is when i told him to just look up and take his mind off it so hes looking up at the sky and the cable and starting to calm down when the lift starts moving again we come to a support tower so i point out how everything works and how each sheave wheel has only about of rubber and of steel keeping the cable from running right off the side as well as a whole lot of tension then i point out the grip this is where the chair attaches to the haul rope cable i point out how its not really attached its just kind of clamped on there and designed to be loose enough to slip a little bit at a time then also notice that steel bolt sticking out the side of the grip see how its just held on there with a nut and that dinky little cotter pin thats literally the only thing thats preventing us from freefalling feet and crashing into the solid ice below the rest of the day he didnt say too much nor did he return for work the next day or any one after that

i live in apartment building with apartments and three assigned parking spaces one of which is mine for the past few weeks one of my neighbors has started to park his car blocking mine in after talking with the landlord i found out that he does not have any spot in the drive way she said she would either have him move the car or tow it he moved the car temporarily a few days later it was back blocking me in i called the landlord he moved it a few hours later and then again and again and again despite knowing it blocked my car and he was not allowed to park there his blocking me in made my roommate late for her first day of student teaching me walk in the rain a few times back and forth from campus and was rude about having to move his car on thursday he surprisingly wasnt blocking me in and i drove to meet my parents a few miles away when i got home he was back in the driveway and i parked behind him on friday i got drunk and lost my keys ill be the first to admit that i was a little pleased he was finally the one blocked in knowing the only way he would get out is if everyone besides our two cars were left in the driveway which never happens that takes us to this morning when i found a note from him requesting i move my car immediately because he needs to get out i called to try and talk to him so we could come to the understanding that it was my spot according to our lease and he had to stop blocking me in he became rude on the phone bitching about how his car has been blocked for days that he lost his job because of it and that i have an attitude problem he then hung up the phone on me and sent me a text telling me to deal with the police so i did guess who really doesnt care the police and our landlord and me get comfy my charming neighbor im not going anywhere 
at my job most workers myself included keep our snacks in the break room fridge i stack my bag of chex mix on top of my lunch well about a month ago a new hire well call her amy kept stealing my chex mix after a couple days of this happening i decided class action petty revenge needed to be taken i bought a bag of chocolate chex mix the next day to see if she would take that kind as well she did after work that day i bought another bag of chocolate chex mix and some cat food i emptied out all the chex mix poured some cat food in a bowl covered it in chocolate and put it back in the chex mix bag the next day at work i saw her go into the break room i saw her conceal the bag and make her way back to her desk she opened it and without looking at the contents scooped up a giant handful of my special revenge mix and began to chew i sat at my desk sipping a coffee with a shit eating grin knowing what would happen next her eyes widened and her face drained of color she tried to get up but the horrid taste was causing her to gag uncontrollably she tripped over her chair spitting out the vile concoction of cat food and chocolate as she frantically stumbled trying to keep her balance she got up and hurried towards the bathroom looking like she was about to cry id never felt so damn good edit as requested heres what happened after the great cat mix revenge amy never took my chex mix again shed been taking other peoples snacks as well so she was a known food thief at the office but since shes quite physically attractive nobody really called her out on it i never mentioned to anyone working there i did it i kept it to myself ive only ever been seen at the office eating original chex mix none of the spin off flavors so nobody thought it was me the discussion about her freak out reached the conclusion she was either sick or had an allergic reaction to this day i enjoy sitting at my desk with a bag of original chex mix in plain sight sipping my coffee with that same shit eating grin whenever she looks my way theres no doubt in my mind she knows i did it 
prenote im asian in most asian cultures in asia the younger generations typically bend over backwards to please their elders but were in america before you read the next part you need to know this part a few months ago i was at a target in line waiting to purchase whatever crap i had come in to get when this middle aged elder couple walked up looked right at me with their smug faces and cut me in line me being too shocked to do anything and knowing koreans do this all the time im koreanjapanese just let it happen and now to what happened the other day my girlfriend and i were at the mall and decided to check out the local apple store walking in its crowded as all hell were walking towards the accessories in the back of the store when i see the asian couple from earlier i would have let them be if the asshole husband didnt push my girlfriend out of the way as i was walking behind her while he passed me i kicked his foot out as hard as i could while still keeping it covert the asshole went down hard but came up just as quickly yelling at his wife in korean thinking she tripped him i just kept walking and waited til we were far enough away to tell my so what i did this is probably the most petty thing anyone could do but i get disrespected more than enough at work and especially by old asian farts who think they can bully younger people
this is not my revenge i was only a witness to the feathery justice that was both rightly and learnedly served upon a mother and her demon spawn years back when i was around years old i was working at the gift shop of the local zoo normally a pretty chill place animal sounds cover the air porcupine body odour wafts through the park those spiny fuckers smell raaaaaank and the ducksahh the ducks i love those ducks by the time most parents reached the gift shop as they are leaving the zoo they are usually tired their kids are hyperexcited and want to buy everything in sight and after they decide what to get for their child they head out simple formula add in the occasional crying kid but hey it was still an easy summer job the zoo is a public place meaning no smoking however if you walk quite literally feet outside of the main gate no one will say a word about your smoking i can attest to this from summers of experience one woman hereafter referred to as dc ducks and cigarettes made one hell of an imprint dc comes in from the main gate with her demonchild in tow and i shit you not shes smoking two lit cigs i really wish i was making that up i attempt to let her know you will get fined if you smoke those h before i am rudely cut off with a i can smoke wherever i want screech sure because youre oh so special by this time her child a little boy probably was throwing a fit about what i cant recall as much of a little shithead as he was i can see where got his attitude they start to walk around the park and after around half an hour they have looped to the other side of the gift shop near the llamas and the pond where the ducks quack merrily at french fry bearing humans upon seeing the ducks dcs child unlike of the other inquisitive children doesnt try to pet or feed them they were crazy friendly he tries to punch them and kick them and generally terrorize the poor things being the chillaxed avians i know and love they back off but remain curious i take a moment to steel myself before once again trying to breach the cranium of nicotine vapours and entitlement to once again tell the woman you cant smoke here they can and will fine you im just telling you for your own sake same angry response from dc sigh but the real reason i came to talk to her again knowing id most likely fail one more thing maam we dont have bandaids at this gift shop and ducks will bite you may want to stop your child at this point i was met with a are you telling me how to raise my child line delivered with the harping screech of a rusted middle aged barn door at one point she even started bitching that ducks dont have teeth they couldnt bite if they wanted to ok sure you win crazy lady back to my desk and my book well about minutes later i hear a wail an inhuman souls of hell escaping through junk calorie saturated in tobacco scream that duck bit my baby and here we are dc carrying her special snowflake as he is crying up a storm the slightest trickle of crimson running down his hand like a messy child with a dark cherry snocone i need a bandaid my poor baby was assaulted by those vicious ducks i politely reminded her that a i warned you b youre still smoking and c go to the goddamn admin building i tried telling you before thats where any first aid is administered oh and put your smoke out they will fine you couple minutes later i see her being escorted out by park security writing her a citation for smoking i want to hope her hell spawn learned a lesson that day but i fear that the thick skulls of entitlement may be hereditary tldr get fined for public smoking punching ducks bad idea 
about years ago i worked for a something year old woman who was very old school when it came to etiquette and was very critical of other women who didnt adhere to her strict code im talking things like my allergy to most make up even stuff for sensitive skin was no excuse to not wear it or wearing business slacks instead of a pencil skirt with a knee length hemline and stockings was a big issue despite adhering to the company dress code according to her we werent presentable mind you this was in a job where the public never saw us and we didnt wear anything that showed what company we worked for whenever shed criticize me or a coworker shes always start with name a young lady should never then nit pick at whatever small infraction she perceived anyway some coworkers and i went out for a few drinks at the barrestaurant next door to our office building on a friday night it was the end of my nd last week there and my last day was the day of the office christmas party so we kind of had to do my going away drinks that night my boss came in to have dinner with someone about an hour after we arrived she came over to say hi and saw me drinking a magners cider out of the bottle reference aetra she huffs a young lady should never drink out of the bottle and never beer ladies should only drink wine when having alcohol after maybe more minutes she heads off to the restaurant i usually let it slide when she criticised me cos i was at work and kind of had to but telling me i shouldnt have something i enjoy outside of work hours because its unladylike and should instead have something i hate because of what people might think of me really got to me my coworkers and i start having a bitch session about her and her year out of date mentality and i hatch a plan i spent that weekend at my mums place and asked her if she could help me pick out a bottle of wine for my boss as a christmas present mum looks at me confused id complained to her many times about my boss till i explain i meant get a bottle from her collection not from the shop understanding dawns and we start perusing her wine collection now mum has a very large wine collection its all very old was probably expensive at one point but after being shaken up in moves all over australia kept in an non airconditioned room in queensland for years and not being rotated its mostly just vinegar now so she helps me pick out a red that looks like it should be very nice and fancy and i give it to my boss on the following friday at the christmas party shes very grateful and says im glad i could teach you some manners while i just keep a stiff smile plastered on my face i never saw the fallout but one of my old coworkers who im friends with on facebook told me that she came into work fuming after the christmasnew years break and the first words out of her mouth were asking where i was apparently shed opened the bottle on christmas eve and poured glasses for herself her husband and her kids all adults so its ok they all said cheers took big sips and promptly ran for the sink to spit it out in the mad rush for the sink though someone knocked the coffee table the bottle was standing on and spilt the red winevinegar onto the carpet tldr female boss tries to force her s mentality on me and other female coworkers i ruin her carpet without ever setting foot in her house edit just wanted to add that i didnt think shed actually drink it let alone have it ruin her carpet and i actually felt bad about that i know from experience how much if a pain in the arse red wine is to get out of carpet after a bottle broke in mums sideboard and it leaked out ruining the carpet and seeping into the wood which made the sideboard stink like booze for a year i thought shed open the bottle realise something was off then pour it down the sink or use it as cooking wine

years ago as a student i worked in a familyowned retail store the owners knew their customers well and some customers thought of themselves as friends of the owners but they treated the staff like servants that was fine i was after all paid to serve customers there was one customer who came in every friday for her order she ordered some bakery items that the store bought from a bakery and sometimes the bakery didnt deliver or maybe the owners didnt order in time because staff were not allowed to place orders well she was quite the asshat to the staff when her order wasnt available one particular friday i was the lucky one to advise her that her order was missing some items she went on a rant on how hard it must be for the wonderful owners of store to have such incompetent staff the owners order her effing stuff not us i stood there and took her abuse never mentioning who made the orders what i suspected the customer did not know was that the patriarch of the family who ill call john passed away days previous and this was why orders had not been placed because you know when you die in addition to being dead you no longer place orders with your suppliers so while i stood there smiling while she insulted me i decided to take petty revenge i am so sorry about the mixup but im sure you can understand that the store has been a bit chaotic this week she was confused perfect will you be joining us at the viewing tonight now she was reealllly confused what are you talking about she said johns viewing is tonight oh dear you didnt know he passed away this week the look on her face was priceless she began to cry paid the bill grabbed her stuff and walked out the door i never saw her at the store again didnt see her at the viewing that night either
the background so theres this guy who lives near my neighborhood who is an evil driver im talking the kind of guy who will pull into an empty right turn lane to cut of the people in the left lane turns left in front of them from the wrong lane he is always curb checking around corners and veering around other cars even going up onto sidewalks his car is very distinctive so it is pretty obvious when it is him he is especially bad in our wally world parking lot near my house he will whip around other cars park in handicap spots with no handicap tag and flings his doors open into cars parked next to him as a permanent pedestrian i hate this guy with a burning passion i was hunkering for some kind of petty revenge the set up so one day he comes flying past me in the parking lot nearly knocks me down then honks at me and shouts keep out the way cripple whips himself into the oncominglane to park crooked in the handicap spot flings his door open like usual and huffs his way on up to the door shouting on his cell phone the entire way i wander up to his car and notice that he has this kind of door handle the kind that flips away from the car to open and i have superglue in my bag the revenge so very casually i pull up on the handle and put a gob of superglue under every handle on this jerks car push down on it a bit to make sure it sets i want a rest anyways so i sit on the bench right out front about metres from where his car is parked with driver side towards me some good fortune ten minutes later he hasnt come out yet so i wander on over check the handles no motion in them at all perfect sit and wait and about five minutes after that he comes out still on his celly hes got a fast food bag and a big drink on one hand other has his cell phone he goes over to his door yanks on the handle hard as he can as is his custom and nearly falls backwards as the door doesnt open for some reason i guess his hand slipped his drink and food goes flying he curses yanks on the handle again no give i am laughing so hard i nearly died he checks his other handles no go he is screaming curses and at this point i go on inside to let the customer service desk know some guy with no handicap tags is parked in the handicap space cue laughter the whole walk home 
ive been getting emails a day reminding me to fill out a bunch of evaluations for a class i didnt want to take in the first place i did the evaluations but am still getting reminders so i emailed the lady and asked politely to stop getting the reminders to which she replied they are automatic i have no control over it oh thats what were doing cool so i set up a nice response email which will respond automatically to every message with messages of my own i got emails over the weekend which went directly to the trash she has emails in her inbox she sent me a personal email saying i dont need to respond to the emails to which i replied oh those are automatic i have no control over it 
i was reminded of this story that my aunt had told me while commenting in a thread on another post it got buried amongst the other comments so i thought id tell her story here as its own post sorry if you have already read this story before in that comment thread my aunt is a retired police officer a few years ago before she had retired she went through a mcdonalds drive through in her police cruiser she got a really weird feeling when the mcdonalds employee handed her order to her he had this smirk on his face and was acting overly nice in a really fake way thats how she described it me her th sense was going off like crazy so she took her food and pulled into a spot in the parking lot to examine her burger sure enough there was a pretty obvious phlegmy loogie right in the middle of her burger since food tampering is a pretty serious offense she went inside the restaurant to confront the drive through employee he denied over and over again and then had the nerve to tell my aunt that she had no proof he had done anything to her burger his smugness sent her over the edge so she left the mcdonalds with the burger in her hand as the evidence that the drive through moron claimed she didnt have a little later two other police officers arrived at the mcdonalds to question the douche bag they told him that the burger was all the evidence they needed and if they needed to they could easily get dna sample from it im not sure whether they would have actually used the resources to run a dna test but they didnt need to in the end because the kid broke down like a sputtering idiot and confessed to spitting in the burger i believe that he got charged with felony food tampering 
i lived in apartment style dorms on a college campus with three guys a c and f not initials but instead their gpas a was a great guy and we hung out often c was a cool enough guy but kept to himself and f a friend of cs was a total asshole f frequently blasted loud music from his laptop even though he had headphones rearranged furniture to his liking when nobody else agreed to it ate food that wasnt his was a complete womanizer and constantly made a mess of the kitchen he also firmly believed the universe revolved around him im not kidding when i say he once told me this is my world everyone else is a guest in it i could go on ranting about the various ways he pissed us all off but our move out day was the worst of them all in the week prior he told us to sign up for a room to clean bathroom common room dining room etc because there was a hefty fine if you left your apartment in a terrible state when you moved out because he used it often f agreed to clean the kitchen the filthiest room in the place now a bit of background that will be important later earlier in the week c accidentally knocked a hole in the wall so we needed to get a paper from our resident advisor ra saying c agrees to solely pay for damaging the wall we all signed it and handed it back to the ra move out day rolls around and f sleeps in until pm a c and i all woke up around am and cleaned our respective rooms and went to campus to take any final exams we had left f finally wakes up and leaves to take a final without a word to any of us everything is spotless but the kitchen is disgusting old food stains crap in the sink and on the floor the works f finally comes home while a and c are off doing finals ive already finished and im packing all my belongings i look up to see f walk in the front door stare at the kitchen then turn to me with a grin ive gotta go to work so im gunna go ahead and be a bad roommate and not clean the kitchen have a nice life then he grabbed his box of belongings and left i was stunned that hed just screwed us all over without a care in the world eventually a and c come home and i explain what happened which pisses them off just as much thats when i remembered the paper we all signed and agreed to i hurried to my ras apartment and told him what had happened then asked him for the paper back so i could write f agrees to solely pay any amp all additional fines related to damages or cleaning my ra replied normally i wouldnt allow something this unethical but f has made my job hell this year so as far as im concerned you havent given me this yet i took the paper back wrote out my petty revenge with a and c agreeing it should be done then turned it back in i heard through the grapevine he ended up getting an uncomfortably large bill over the summer
the exact change story reminded me of a petty revenge story i remember hearing this story from the person who trained me back when i worked retail guy walks into a gas station at am the shifts just changed everything has been dropped or cashed out guy picks up a caramel piece yes those cents per caramel pieces and puts it down next to a hundred my trainers trainer tt was the one on till that day looks down at the caramel looks over at the hundred looks up at the man and asks do you have anything smaller no tt explains he wont have enough change if he takes the hundred guy replies i dont care i guess that is what cut the string in tt because what followed was something anybody in retail always wanted to do tt takes out his cash drawer which has exactly dollars in it takes out one dime from the cash drawer and dumps the rest of the cash drawer into a plastic bag he then picks up the hundred and puts it into the now empty cash drawer he walks over to his second till which also has exactly dollars in it and dumps that into the bag too he then hands it over to the guy what the hell is this guy your change sir tt i dont want all this change guy i dont care tt edit for people asking about the float i dont remember exactly the breakdown but it was dollars in change and dollars in bill per till when i was around so in change and in bills regarding the counterfeit possibility i dont know this story was told to me by my trainer about the guy who trained him my trainer never mentioned the other guy getting in trouble or anything so i am assuming it was just an asshole customer rather than a criminal

my manager is an asshole anyways there he was last friday bitching at all the employees to do their job faster because he had to close early and rush home to his wife im busy mopping the floor in the entry way to the back when he pulled the whole youmissedaspot act as in stopped what he was doing to watch my for a couple minutes before saying anything when he went outside the double doors i poured out some of the water from my bucket onto the floor by the doors as he came through in a rush just like he said he slipped and landed on his ass i told him to be careful thats why the sign says slippery when wet 
so i rubbed some grease from the leftover fried chicken on his xboxs power button now whenever hes playing his dog will walk by and sniff the button turning it off midgame
im a barista in a big city and we have one customer that comes in pretty frequently he looks about but wears a suit which clearly means he has a super important job and that he is a super cool and important person thing is he is actually really awful one of those pasty blushing very overweight sweaty guys that has a really rude and arrogant personality but for some reason with that suit on he is superman anyway when he comes in he is always very entitled and frequently tries to hit on the baristas as if there is no way they could resist his charm so he comes in the other day and did his usual act and then when i asked for his name clearly for the cup and not because i was remotely interested in him he winked at me as he said its matt and smiled arrogantly i nodded and promptly in huge letters on his cup wrote max i heard him but the idea that later on he would realize i cared so little about him that i didnt even attempt to get his name right made me feel warm inside yes its small and extremely petty but i still giggled

be kind first time writing a story and english is my second language i work in a candy factory my coworker has to write down the temperature of the candy every minutes another coworker had asked for my cell number so i grab the pen that was on a desk to write it down when the my other coworker comes over and snatches it from my hand tells me i can not use it cause i am using up his ink i said oh okay i wait a few hours and when he is not looking i grab the pen and throw it in the trash i was amazed how good it felt edit i little more info about what happened the desk is a public desk and it the kind that you have to be standing to use the pen was a cheap one 
i dont exactly have a reason for this petty revenge but if youve got siblings you know you dont really need a reason my wife was pregnant last year with a due date in early to mid september when we told our family my brother who has a late september birthday joked that baby better come on time i dont want to share my birthday jump to september the due date comes and goes and goes and goes amazingly shes gotten to be a full weeks late the doctors are pushing for an induction and weve finally agreed it just so happens that the induction date is the date of my brothers birthday so far this is just a coincidence were supposed to go into the hospital at am at am the day of my brothers birthday my wife goes into labor she labors all night we go to the hospital at am and the doctors are thrilled that this is happening naturally no induction needed still just a coincidence my wife continues to labor until pm when the doctors start getting concerned that the baby still hasnt arrived diagnostics are showing that the baby is fine but they want us to consider a csection we spend another hours trying different labor positions but by pm its clear that were going to do a csection by the time were in the or and ready to go its pm the nurse turns to me and says theres no medical emergency here and were really close to midnight you can pick the birthday do you want to wait minutes i dont need to think about this at all i dont even think to check with my wife this is a golden opportunity for a revenge that will last for the rest of my life i immediately respond now we have to do this now this kid must be born today and thats how at pm my son was born and i stole my brothers birthday
this happened about three weeks ago i work as a lot attendant i collect the shopping carts and bring them to the front of the store i also help customers load and unload their cars when they need help normally we i let customers park right in front of the entrance of the store with a few conditions they cant block the entrances they cannot block the shopping cart corrals they also have to have reasonably large items that it would be extremely inconvenient to park in the back a customer parks in the front with a douche truck the wheels alone reaching my chest im he decided to block my cart corral exception i was already having a bad day this was our short conversation justsomerandouser good morning im going to need you to move your truck douche with and attitude im trying to take something to returns justsomerandouser so i proceed to do my job would you like some help he ignores me and climbs into his mountain i see him pull out a small can of paint exception he locks his truck and walks in the store im still at work so i cant make a big deal about it however this douche just violated exception and i had none of his shit i proceed to grab basically every shopping cart we had available and began to surround his truck with them i get a total of about carts blocking the front back and driver side he comes out and sees the mess i walk past him smiling and say have a nice day obviously he got mad and yells you better move these i respond i cant somebody blocked the cart corral there is nowhere i can put them for the next minutes he proceeds to remove enough carts so he can squeeze through i think its safe to say we lost a customer that day i havent seen him since tldr douche parks where he isnt supposed to so i make him stay there longer than he planned

so i am a teacher at an elementary school and im in my early s we have this lady who teaches at the school who is a train wreck of a person most of the time i feel bad for her but she can really piss me off with her selfishness one of our work rooms with a copier is near both of our classrooms but she acts like she owns it to the point where i will be running copies and she will stop my job to put hers in saying that she is sooo stressedpressed for time etc i have let a lot of things slide but today was too much this morning she came in as i was leaving and was like athwartthelotus you need to check the paper you ran a huge project and its not fair if it runs out of paper while other people use it i had made single sided copies i thought about fighting her but as she went on about how im young and dont know how to be polite and how she is old so she cant bend down to change the paper not true i decided enough was enough i grabbed two reams and proceeded to open them on the back counter however before i put them in i folded the third piece of paper in each ream so it would catch in the copier i loaded the papers told her to have a great day and id see her later and then exited as she started her job from down the hall i could hear the beeping of a miss feed and her lamenting to no one about how this would take forever to fix and she wouldnt get her break if you treat me like im your stupid slave your work will get really difficult really fast 
driving to work i apparently pissed someone off something fierce there was a large pickup truck in front of me trying to get in the left lane i suspected because he needed to turn at an upcoming light but a pathfinder was being a douche and hanging out just to the left of him despite the speed of traffic the left lane slowed down a bit so the pathfinder was a little behind me but the truck still couldnt get over because of another car in front of the pathfinder tired of watching this guy be a jerk i took the opportunity to get in front of the pathfinder with plenty of room mind you slow down enough to let the truck over just in time for his left turn and then get back into the right lane pathfinder then makes it his mission to tailgate me with his high beams on i have an autodimming feature in my rear view mirror so i only noticed because i saw the extra pair of lights come on but game on buddy thats my right turn coming up i better slow downa lotyou know to make sure there are no pedestrians in the crosswalk at my turn oh see that guy up there about feet from the crosswalk i better make sure he has plenty of time to cross safelyhe does have the right of way after all pathfinder honks then leans on his horn and cant get around me because he had been tailgatingthen the light turns red just as the pedestrian finishes crossing i make a safe and legal right on red and pathfinder has just added about minutes to his commute happy wednesday
the lot i park in is usually full so finding an open spot is a gift from god this guy must have driven all the way to the roof found no spots and was on his way to exit at the first floor when he saw me enter he honked at me the whole time i was walking to my car to hurry up the whole time i dropped my luggage into the trunk and then flipped me off as i was adjusting my seat my boyfriend drives my car and is a giant so i pulled out half way just enough to block him from exiting and then parked again and sat there in my car reading reddit on my phone as he honked and banged his head on his steering wheel in exasperation i sat there for about minutes

when the sixth harry potter book came out i was and finally old enough for my mom to let me stay up all night and go to the midnight release this is a huge event so instead of making everyone stand in line all night the bookstore gave away numbered wristbands in a line in the morning so that the nighttime could be spent doing activities when i got there in the morning i was pretty bummed because it looked like there were a hundred or so people in front of me including my neighbor and her dad would proceeded to laugh when they saw me walk in and had to go to the back of the line i got to the front and the lady at the table asked me did you preorder the book fuuuuck i didnt know that you had to preorder them i told her i hadnt and she gave me a different colored wristband than everyone else i looked down and saw the number on the wristband and it was number when my neighbor and her dad saw it they laughed even harder and told me that id probably have to wait for everyone to get their preordered books first and then theyll move on to me and the other normal release people fast forward to around pm and everyone is starting to line up by their numbers after asking a bookstore employee where to line up she points to a much shorter line than the main one that everyone was in and i was the first in line i got my book at exactly midnight and walked over to my neighbor and dad who still had probably people in front of them the look on their faces was priceless when i started reading the first couple sentences of the first chapter out loud to them while they were still standing in line
this happened a while ago but i stumbled into this sub and figured it might fit its work related but im going to try to keep the jobspecific jargon to a minimum quick background i had been working at my job for a few years and decided to apply for the management program no easy task to even get in and when i went through of the people who were accepted actually completed the course the course was a major ball breaker and those in it were usually regarded as subhuman throughout it sounds weird but it was effective in trimming the fat those directly associated with the course were trained in the art of balancing this facade with actual learning points the problem usually came from those who saw this and assumed it was cool to be an asshole too the actual story i get told that im going to continue my course and the horrific jobs that entailed but also drive the big boss around and play chauffeur for a while i go to the guy in charge of the vehicles and other logistical boringness and get the bosss vehicle and go about my way dude was uber douche throughout our entire interaction ill call him major douche after days of babysitting this stupid truck and massive amounts of arduous awfulness it comes time to head back to the main complex and return to some semblance of normalcy i park the bosss truck in the bosss reserved spot boss leaves and i start taking care of things that need to be done putting the bosss work truck back is on the list but not the top i return about an hour later to an empty parking spot these work trucks do not have keys super someone stole my bosss truck that im responsible for we were somewhere where anyone not working in the same place wouldnt have access to the truck so it wasnt in a chop shop being optimistic which never works out well for me i walk across the street to maj douches office maj douche knew i was coming to him with this truck and maybe he saw it and just took it back saving me an errand nope maj douche shifts into maximumoverdouche and tries to take a page from the instructors handbook so after an obscenely condescending igotyounowfucker speech he essentially denies having the truck i gleaned he did and was hiding it to teach me a lesson and smugly sends me on my way because if i dont find it im done for figure it out i am in no mood so instead of panicking and running around on the impossible scavenger hunt like he expected as he chuckled his way back to his office i walk my ass straight to the complexs police station we have our own cops not security guards arrest power throw your ass in jail cops i find two cops and explain the situation i tell them im in the management course and maj douche has issued a learning challenge of sorts and im supposed to figure out how to properly handle it the senior cop laughs and says maj douche i fucking hate that guy were in i watched from a comfortable distance as the cops roll in and smugly say they are investigating grand theft auto and he was the prime suspect and in a world of hurt quivering and sweating he threw out his side of the story and the cops played it better than i could have imagined this went on for glorious minutes eventually he led them to his locked hiding place and all was well the big boss walked out of his building and asked me what the hell was going on i explained how i was overcoming a training related challenge and told the story he laughed and we stood together and watched the rest of the drama unfold the cops left and i walked over hey sir i see we got the truck back good news huh he glared and stormed off i throw in a sir isnt that what i should have done with a stolen vehicle he slams the door i engaged smug face myself and turned back across the road i know technically i did have the truck stolen from me and im an asshole but technically in that situation one would report it to the cops he started the technically game and i saw it through 
i was inspired by a previous post by a parent who got some sweet revenge on his kids in the store ill preface this by saying that im a single father of kids at home in college i get home from work a few nights ago and everyone is lounging on the couch after school and eating snacks and having a grand old time i came home as i usually do ready to cook dinner and eat with my children i immediately notice the sink overflowing with dishes the dryer full of clothes floor needs swept etc each has their set chores to do every day so i started cleaning the kitchen kid s chore today while they said hi dad and just continued on their merry way then went and done a load of laundry kid s chore you get the drift this went on for about an hour until one of them said dad im hungry what are we going to eat oh eat you say that sounds like my chore i dont have time to do my chores children im too busy doing yours this is as im finishing the last chore and sitting down with a sandwich and a glass of tea house clean and ready to watch some baseball the chores were done the next day when i got home funny how that works 
im a cashier the most annoying thing ever is when customers refuse to hand me their money its rude to throw it down on the counter or throw it in my general direction yesterday a customer on her phone was too busy talking to pay for her things maam your total is maam your total comes to dollars and cents will that be cash or card maam will that be cash or credit she finally threw a crumpled dollar bill at me the revenge when i gave her her change i put it on the counter instead of putting it in her outstretched hand hah take that edit holy crap front page
i work at a call center in the downtown area of a moderately sized city theyll hire anyone with a heartbeat so theres a whole lot of creepsters theres an area fondly known as the smokers pit it sits between the building and some train tracks and theres a chainlink fence locking you in to it i was out there having my midafternoon smoke and some guy starts up a conversation hes much older than me and wouldnt stop trying to touch me he would try to reach out and pet my hair grab my scarf try to light my already lit cigarette asked me about my bra size the mayor of creeptown had arrived i just kept silent dodged his attempts to make contact and gave him the nastiest glare i could muster i interrupted him finally to tell him i wasnt interested but he wouldnt take no for an answer so i farted i turned pushed and released it sounded perfect it was loud and lasting and it echoed in the hellish pit where cancer flares to life in the lungs of the depressed high school dropouts and desperate single parents just barely scraping by it was glorious he stopped mid sentence and just stared at me with his mouth open i walked away trying my best not to laugh ive seen him once since then no eye contact was made i dont win often but i won that day

this story is from many years ago but i was reminded of it since we just had our first snowfall in michigan when i was a young kid in new jersey my friends and i would walk around town with shovels and offered to shovel for people who just didnt want to do it it was a good way to get exercise and more importantly make some money most of the time things went smoothly but there was one incident that i will always remember in a blizzard went through the area so like clockwork as soon as the snow was done we met at my house and went out to do our thing we get to this one house where an older man answered the door we offer to shovel for him and he accepts and thanks us we finished in about minutes and i go knock on his door to inform him were done after i tell him he looks at me for a second and asks me why im still there i say to him well we did just shovel so you wouldnt have to he asks if we want to be paid for doing it to which i said it would be nice he then says to me hard work is its own reward and slams the door in my face i go down and tell my friends what he had said when one of them looked at me and said well if thats the case why dont we reward ourselves some more so after more minutes i knock on his door again and apologize to him for just assuming he was going to pay us he looks past me and realizes that his driveway sidewalk and front walkway are again covered in snow he asked what was going on to which i said well since you told us hard work is its own reward we decided to reward ourselves by putting the snow back he starts shouting a stream of obscenities at us but i just tell him to have a nice day and we left to go do more houses from what i heard after that he still tried to stiff kids that did that for him any chance he could edit since most of the comments are saying that a payment shouldnt be expected i wasnt the first or last person to do this and most of the people in the town im from gladly compensated kids who would shovel for them whether it be money or baked goods or something along those lines my mother did it when kids came to shovel and at times shed send me out with the money when there were done now there were times when someone couldnt and that was totally fine usually it was a thank you very much from them us saying have a nice day and moving on however this guy decided he wanted to be a jackass which is why we put the snow back this was not an issue of not being compensated this was an issue of the guy being a douchebag about it also top post in the subreddit thanks second edit read the first edit before you comment a lot of you are missing the point of this
i work in retail so its basically part of the job description to say have a nice day to customers when they leave and since everyone expects to hear it the rude customers dont even think twice when i hit them with this bombshell when they leave have a day got em
my cat woke me up before am by running around like a methcrazed douchebag i decided to get up and start my day around am i catch the little shit sleeping on my bed and man this is a good sleep like full on rem sleep with twitching paws and everything shook that bitch awake and pushed her off onto the floor 
i work as a freelancer writing editing copywriting community management consulting and have done it long enough that work mostly comes to me a friend sent me along an ad for a job that fit my normal work and paid obscenely well i applied and was asked to do a test job on spec doing a test on spec is normally something i turn down immediately but the pay was unusually high and hourly so i obliged i got the job started looking through the contract and realized the pay that was advertised was grossly misquoted times less and per project and not by the hour this is a really common problem in the freelancing world companies expect quality work at third world wages and get away with paying fees that often amount to below minimum wage because they pay you per project not by the hour people take it because they are starting out and want to build a portfolio or are just desperate for money its a vicious abusive disgusting cycle that undervalues peoples time and work and it makes my blood fucking boil every time i encounter a client that thinks i should blow him for a job normally i wouldve told the client to go royally fuck themselves for completely wasting my time and blatantly lying in the project and pay description but i thought actions might speak louder than words this particular business was an intermediary this means they get a client that needs a ton of copy written and hire out to a database of writers the platform is set up to automatically send assignments so i marked my availability at the maximum and let the assignments roll in with zero intention of even looking at them ever again it took the business three weeks to catch on now they have a few dozen very late projects a really pissed client and will have to pay their other writers double or triple their rate to get things wrapped up quickly i felt like robin hood today 
a week ago while brushing my teeth i noticed that i needed a new head for my oral b easy ill just stop by the store and pick on up right no of course not i kept forgetting even when i went shopping for food it slipped my mind so my wife was running to the store one evening and asked me do you need anything finally the lightbulb went off here was my chance to get the replacement yeah some of those tooth brush heads for my thing would be great came my reply about an hour later she returns carrying bags of items i start to dig through the bags helping to put things away cold stuff into the fridge dry goods pantry easy bag by bag it dwindles down to one last bagtoiletries no tooth brush heads only a blue generic toothbrush with some sort of basic power option and a standard pink no frills toothbrush oh no tooth brush heads i asked they are too expensive cant fault her for being frugal just use this one she says as she hands me the nofrills pink toothbrush now i am not one to complain about the colorits just a color but a basic no frills pink while she gets the blue powered brush what the hell you got a blue powered toothbrush and i got a pink no frills she just laughed it off and continued on putting the other toiletries away time for some of that petty revenge i keep reading on reddit the next day i was folding laundry while she was working with our kids this was my chance i folded all her clothes perfectly and even put then away for her rare feat in our house now you are wonderingwait where is the revenge later she thanked me for taking care of the clothes as she was pulling out clothes for the next day only to discover everything of hers was folded perfectlyinside out revenge shall be mine
a story about a dogs revenge reminded me of this my inlaws lived in a very large house it had stories and the top floor was a two room suite with a bath my husband and i lived on this third floor for a while when he was finishing college the windows at the top of the house were double windows not just doublepaned windows but there was actually an inner window that opened inward and an out window that opened outward with about inches of space between them id never seen this type of window setup before but hey i was raised in a trailer park so what do i know before my husband and i lived in these rooms his brother b and his brothers girlfriend bg lived there now bg was a bitch on wheels no one in the family actually liked her except b but you cant choose your family while b and bg were living on the third floor bg locked my inlaws big black cat between the windows the cat had crawled into the space between the windows and she closed the inner window and left the cat there for hours on purpose my motherinlaw finally found the cat and let it out both the cat and my motherinlaw were quite angry about the incident but in order to keep peace in the family my motherinlaw decided to let it go the cat not so much bg was a clothes horse she spent more money on clothes than i made in a year she had some very nice clothes leather boots silk dresses etc well the cat decided that it really didnt like bg after the window incident and every chance it got it would pee on bgs clothes before b and bg moved out that cat must have ruined several hundred dollars worth of leather boots purses and other clothing no matter how hard bg tried to keep that cat out of her rooms he managed to get in destroy something and get out without her seeing him i suspect the cat had an accomplice but my motherinlaw would never admit it
for reasons i spend a lot of time at the gym to get rid of stress the building that houses my gym also houses a pool which during a certain time window every day the high schoolers use for their physical education the locker room is shared for the both of us some of those high schoolers dont even bother using the lockers and just drop everything on the floor yesterday some idiot didnt even bother to drop his stuff in the locker room he just dropped it in the entrance of the locker room theres around lockers so plenty of space so i did the only reasonable thing and hid his stuff in a random locker 
i spent two months living in a dorm with one of the worst human beings on the planet she was basically everything you hear about bad roommates along with serious emotionalbehavioral issues that led to her leaving but i will cut to the revenge we got along for the first week until we started fighting about her nighttime texting it wouldnt be an issue if she didnt leave the text notification ringtone on high volume all nightthe chorus of katy perrys waking up in vegas and she refused to turn it on silent because she needed to hear her alarm in the morning for class but really she was so socially obsessive and insecure that she did not want to miss any text convos even if it means waking up throughout the night even after she was awake shed leave the sound on as the conversation continued it was really loud because she was a heavy sleeper i would wake up at noon exhausted before class and work as she slept in longer i got by on naps when she wasnt around shed deny knowing how to change this and wouldnt let me show her how to do it since this would just be putting it on silent insisting that it wasnt possible even though we had the same phone i started to get really pissed every time it happened and then shed assure me the ringer was off only to happen again an hour later i didnt think it would wake you up you were so asleep shed say it was a battle almost every night until i moved out she probably didnt know how obvious her bullshit was as she was terrible with technology though she claimed to be a mac genius as i waited for help from the housing department i started fucking with her in subtle ways she had a really nice macbook pro that appeared to only be used for facebook after she left her laptop at the room one day i dimmed the screen all the way down to black i thought it would be either a minor inconvenience or a trip to a repair kiosk that would make her feel silly she tried to use it later and thought the screen was broken so she started crying yelling and throwing things she did not even have anything pressing to work on then she called her mom who told her to bring it in and if they couldnt fix it she could get the newer macbook that shed been wanting so bad the broken one was just a year old her parents got her practically everything she wanted including new clothes when she ran out of clean laundry a couple days later she comes back from the computer store after her laptop was sitting on her desk all day she calls her mom saying that the computer was unsalvageable since she said she was just throwing the old one away i ask if i can have it for the next week told her i was working on it as she made fun of me for thinking im smarter than the geek squad when she saw that i fixed it she was pissed but distracted with her new computer im still enjoying my free relatively new laptop which may make this seem not so petty but nice things meant so little to her and it still wasnt worth the horrors of living with her i eventually moved out after she started stalking and harassing me 
scenario i have this class that meets once a week for hours the professor is great she clearly knows and loves her field shes disabled wheelchair bound she moves very slowly sometimes shes minutes late for class i dont even mind since she always lets us out way early in return attendance is mandatory and if someone misses more than class without informing her ahead of time or asap if an emergency arises then they automatically fail the class and get dropped im certain shes willing to work with students its just that this particular class always has a waiting list so she wants us to understand that if were not serious about the course then were taking up space that another student could be utilizing the class is small about students nearly all are straight out of high school im in my mids a strangely large proportion of them about half are incredibly negative immature assholes the others are too shy to speak up they complain about everything they mutter little passive aggressive comments under their breath as she teaches although she tells us multiple times what is due the following week and its clearly written in the syllabus and she emails us every week somehow they have never have any idea whats going on and they always blame her theyre pretty rude to her face to begin with but when they walk out theyll talk loudly about what an ugly incompetent crippled bitch she is and how they dont give a shit about this class they have better things to do than the homework so theyre just not going to do it because their dumb asses dont realize we can hear every word a few weeks ago i stuck up for her as we were all sitting in class waiting that group sits right behind and next to me and they were giggling about how itll probably be forever since shes slow as hell in her chair and its amazing that she can even get out of bed why does she even botherjust really cruel mocking in general it was disgusting i cut in during one particularly mean comment me uhh thats rude as fuck yall girl uhh mind your own business guy yeah we werent talking to you me i cant uhhh mind my own business when youre saying stuff like that right in my ear and by the way i hope you guys know we can hear yall in the hall after class and im surprised she hasnt gone to the department to report you for harassment they look at each other uncertainly but one girl they cant do shit i can say whatever the fuck i wanna say i dont give a fuck what that bitch does we hear that bitch in the hallway and fall silent let it go class proceeds as usual when she dismisses us i smile at her and say bye and i catch some of that group rolling their eyes they see me as some sort of prissy teachers pet because i treat her with common courtesy well yesterday we had class the professor was late again after minutes students are talking about leaving they bring up the class is cancelled after minutes if the professor doesnt show up rule i tell them thats a myth they insist its true because soandso told them so and also its in the schools policies it isnt after minutes one of the guys comes in sighing that he saw her downstairs we know itll take her another minutes to traverse the elevator and hallway and the other students start talking wildly if we all walk out then she cant hold it against us well just pretend we waited minutes and then walk out here we can even sign our names on a piece of paper im thinking no thats messed up you know shes here we only meet once a week can you really not deign to show up to four classes a month that arent even as long as they could be most of the students sign the paper and dash down a side staircase three or four are slowly walking out but clearly uncomfortable wavering a few students stay behind to convince us to leave because it only works if everyone goes i realize they arent going to leave unless we all go i have an idea i motion to the stragglers to follow me into the stairwell the other students assume weve caved clap us on the back and hurry past us once theyre out of sight i turn to the students that are left who surprise surprise also happen to be the people who do their hw and dont rag on the professor and tell them the minute thing is a myth and im not going to give up my only absence because the others decided they didnt feel like doing class today i walk back in and so do they the professor comes in apologizes profusely a meeting went on longer than expected and it was raining outside which slowed her down and expresses surprise that so few of us are here someone tells her the others left after minutes she says thats a myth and that its too bad for them but hey its a good thing her best students stayed behind because shes giving us a review of exactly what to study for the upcoming test info that im certain the others desperately need since theyve been blowing off the hw and barely paying attention in class afterwards i said oh yeah the other students signed this paper to show they were here here you go and she took it and ripped it in half then she laughed and said you know had everyone left i would have actually given you all a free absence since i was late but since some of you stuck it out i cant do that i know its petty but i cant wait until next week theyre gonna be so pissed im seriously considering going to the department and telling them about everything thats been said asking them to have someone sit out in the hall and listen to how they treat her because i know theyre gonna lose it oh i would love to hear them argue with an hr rep or a security guard about the verbal harassment policy our college upholds welcome to college time to be held accountable for your actions tldr awful students mock professors disability try to convince us to leave class early one day when shes late we make them think were leaving but then come back this makes them use up their only absence and they dont get to review as a class what to study for the next test
a few years ago in high school i was really into fixing phones i would by screens on ebay and charge for my timeish hours friends got discounts and because it was high school was ripping people offfor a screen that apple would replace for many people used me as an easy way to make off their parents which i was cool with i had a lot of complaining about how i shouldnt be charging for a screen so i let a lot of people slide with or even if i knew money was tight in their family or like they actually worked for their own money anyway this rich smug asshole comes up to me after class one day and asks if i can fix his phone this was possibly the first thing that he has ever said to me that wasnt rude or sarcastic sure grabbed his phone after school going out of my way to meet him we agreed on my normal price which is pretty fair told him to meet me at like or something because he had some dumb rich kid shit to do he pulls up in an k audi and i show him his phone he hands me and said i would get the rest in school sure next day i ask him if he had the money he said he didnt he did sure ask him every other day for a week trying not to be an annoying asshole about it and he keeps saying that i will get it the next day sure about weeks pass and i told him that i really needed it for more parts to fix other phones by the way i have talked to several people in the class who i thought he was friends with and explained the story everyone sympathized with me and says he was a giant douche and definitely had the money in his pocket along with hundreds more from his parents i tell him that i needed it by friday it was like tuesday sure friday rolls around and i finally ask him just give me a straight answer are you going to pay me the remaining or not he rolls his eyes and gives me a really shitty problee nahh i hand him the same bill he gave me uhhhh what is this for takes the bill as he sets down his phone i pick it up and before he realizes that i have it i smash it face first on the ground in front him and the whole class ohh my god what the fuck transaction canceled still nerdy but the smoothest thing i could think of saying teacher takes us to the office on the way i explain the situation to her after hearing the story she sends us straight to class instead of the office gtohh my god what the fuck last words he ever said to me got the most fulfilling high fives for that tldr rebroke a phone a rich asshole wouldnt pay for 
theres an absolutely batshit crazy woman at work shes a bit of a hunchback and i hear that when her rich father died she ran waddled around the office yelling hes dead hes dead but i try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and treat them with respect that is until she fucked with me i was driving through the parking lot and drove past her she was walking while i was going around mph and giving her plenty of room she starts flailing and yelling at me to slow down etc etc when i was clearly driving completely responsibly but again shes batshit well two days later im walking through the parking lot and she blows by me way too close and doing about mph i needed vengeance she also takes a nap in her front seat parked in the handicap spot right next to the door with her head leaning against the window the first time i saw her i almost called an ambulance but this is just her daily routine to take an hour and a half siesta while getting paid way more than i do for far less work so one day i rode my recently purchased harley fxdx to work the previous owner had put a nice fat into high flow exhaust on it i had also just retuned my carb to get the deepest must guttural rumble i could out of the thing so as i come back from lunch there she is napping with her head against the window sound asleep as i roll by i pull the clutch and open the throttle up as wide as it can go it was deafening she shoots up and starts flailing around wildly in what i can only describe as a combination between the truffle shuffle and a kid with cerebral palsy trying to crip walk she looks all around to see where it came from but all she sees is me riding perfectly responsibly and quietly both hands on the handlebars and a big shit eating grin under my helmet and a few edits for the more special among you she ran around the office excited and in ecstasy that her father had died and she inherited his cash i wouldnt make fun of someone for being distraught after a family member dying there is a difference between tuning your exhaust note and making it as loud as possible i adjusted the carb jetting and mix saturation to get the best performance i could as well as to give it that nice deep vtwin rumble it is loud enough so that on the highway all you textingwhiledriving assholes can hear me coming up past you while youre blasting mgmt but it is not nearly as loud as people who chop off the ends of their pipes and have no muffling whatsoever which seems to be what some of you think i did i was really only going mph i made a point to check it because i couldnt understand why she was flipping out

for the past few months one directionfever has taken my home into its cold unforgiving grasp my sister has been more than obsessed with those kids and well teenagers will be teenagers months go my sister learned about a one direction concert in our home country belgium as a good brother i decided to get her a ticket because i could as the months passed on she started to realize a bit of a problem the concert would be done at midnight in the other side of the country this is belgium so it isnt that far neither my father nor i could pick her up from the concert so after looking for parents who were driving their kids as well she told me none of her other friends were going note that all tickets were also sold out and trying to fix my schedule so i could pick her up i ended up finding the ideal solution a busservice was riding specifically for the concert from my town to antwerp where the concer was taking place and back it seemed perfect and she agreed with me so i paid another bucks for the bus fare and arrenged her a seat in that bus that was weeks ago three days ago she suddenly tells me she wont take the bus afterall the bus was already paid and there was no refund possible she had discovered the bus would arrive an hour before the concert which according to her was not early enough the concert starts at pm but she wants to be in that city at am her plan is to go to the boys hotel and attempt to get autographs i told her it was unlikely shell get autographs which made her freak out she started throwing stuff screaming at me calling me the worst words and telling her how i was taking everything away from her i pointed out that without me there wouldnt be a concert for her and for all intends and purposes that ticket is mine and i can just sell if i wanted to this made her go berserk and she shouted that i should start treating her more like an adult and stop trying to arrenge everything for her i just told her i wasnt comfortable with her taking the train from and to that city on her own especially if i already paid for the busfare on her request she then told me she had arrenged for going with the train with her friends for the past few months which is a blatant lie as she stated she didnt have friends that were going to the concert only a few weeks back now comes the revenge bit note it is very petty and i could probably do more to have my revenge but im too much of a softy for that my sister is notorious for never setting an alarmclock she depends on me or our father to wake her up in time for school and other things if we dont do that shell easily spend the entire day sleeping she was taking the am train but it is currently noon and shes still sleeping i wont wake her up even if it means she misses the concert she has until pm to wake up which should be reasonable i think so she can take the bus like i arrenged for her if she gets angry for not waking her up ill tell her she asked me to treat her like an adult update at pm she woke up she was of course grumpy and started demanding why i did not wake her up earlier i reminded her that she wanted to be treated as an adult and told her that if she had waken up in time she could have left without a problem the message came across though there was some shouting involved she has locked herself up in her room now and im going to leave her and her emotions alone now she did apologize for her behavior which i think is progress shell be able to go to the concert and have a good time later today 
so earlier today a coworker was walking round with a can asking for spare change donations from what i can see from the label i realized afterwards he was likely obscuring the full label on purpose its a kids charity okay cool he gets to my desk and i do have some loose change so i dig it out of my purse as he holds the can out and i put the change in i now see the full label and notice its not a kids charity its an anti abortion foundation i am quite fiercely pro choice maybe i gave about thirty cents i held the rest of the change in my palm once i realized what it was but it was the clear deception thst pissed me off and i know a good bunch of my other coworkers tend not to ask details about donations so he got a lot of mindless donations so i pulled out my phone and made a nice donation to my states local abortion fund and they let you do it in honor of someone so i wrote in honor of asshat coworkers name who thinks he can pull one over on busy office people suddenly monday doesnt seem so bad
about a year ago i went to your everyday office computer supplier to scope out new computers for the office the salesman was so pushy i couldnt even read the specs before he would interrupt he insisted we swap business cards and i was too polite to decline for the next two weeks he called me every day trying to make a sale with me even though i told him multiple times i wouldnt be taking my interest any further anyway one day shortly afterwards i was taking a walk around my work i work near a convention centre and there are often trade fairs etc there at this particular time there was a massive fashion trade fair people were queuing up for a free gift it was pretty cool a tote bag with a mobile phone charger together with a few other smaller gifts all you had to do was drop your business card in a big box and confirm you could be contacted by all the suppliers at the fair i opened my wallet and remembered i still had the computer salesmans business card in there i dropped his card in there instead of mine collected my freebies and as i walked off i noticed the poster for the trade fair saying over suppliers here today
she justified saying ill probably get off before you do without even asking where my destination was it was the last stop before i got a chance to reply she was already mounting her bike on the collapsible bike rack that folded out in front of city on the front spot of all places making it tremendously hard for the second bike rider to mount their bike she goes in to pay her fare while i struggle with rolling my bike across the back spot thinking on the spot i did have a few stray extra thick zipties from my warehouse job in my pocket and i just zipped a few motherfuckers on that bitches wheel to the bus rail i intentionally leave the bus a few stops before the final destination trading off a longer commute to get off clean i just wish i was there to see her struggle with tugging her bike out

okay guys heres one for you at my college drinks are not allowed in the computer lab and it is strictly enforced apparently a lot of people have spilled and fucked up some computers so due to the rule everyone leaves their drinks on this table sitting right outside the lab well everyday i seee some asshole kid and his punk friend walk by and take little sips out of everyones starbucks and expensive drinks they had bought they think it is just the funniest shit ever and think theyre being punk rebels who just dont give a shoot and what not well after seeing this everyday my blood began to boil i dont want some mother fucker sipping on my drink everyday so i decided to act i happen to dip tobacco i know its disgusting but i started young and am now addicted but anyways i went and got me a starbucks coffee cup that next morning and after i drank the majority i began dipping and spitting i made sure to leave a whole lof of the actual dip particles in there as well fast forward an hour or so and what do ya know here come those little prick bastards coming on down the hallway eyeing the drink table like hawks i know my starbucks cup looks very appealing and see him go for it dude takes a monster of a swig and his eyes just about jumped out of his head as he began spitting up and on the verge of projectile vomiting i lost it in the computer lab and got some awkward stares but man that was one of the absolute greatest moments of my life 
this happened about a year ago when my son was or months old he was losing all his baby hair but still had some left on top that i would often spike up a little for a punk rocker effect fil is a fairly conservative guy and didnt really like my choice of hair style he would often make comments like your hair looks gay and youre not gay while combing his hair down i tried my best to ignore him because you know gotta keep peace in the family after a couple of times though i started to get really annoyed i do not want my kid to grow up homophobic or calling people gay so i found the perfect thing to say i spike up little aarons hair and bring him over to the in laws house sure enough fil starts in on the whole gay routine so i say i think hes a little young to know if hes gay or not but lets ask him hey aaron do you like sucking cock fils mouth dropped agape then snapped shut hes never brought it up again and hopefully he understands why its inappropriate to use that sort of language around a child edit father in law people it stands for father in law sorrytil

my parents were out of town so they needed me to give my younger brother and sister a ride home from our schools band competition my mother said to go pick them up around ish and since it was only i decided to play a match in smite at my sister calls me and says to go pick them up see she usually calls way before they are actually there so that she doesnt have to wait a few minutes for me to get there i live approximately minutes away from where they were anyway i was in the middle of a really great match and very confused because i was expecting to go get them later when questioned about it my sister said well be there soon itll only be minutes i didnt want them waiting on me too long so i stopped playing got in the car and drove for about minutes to an empty parking lot i waited for a while but after minutes past i called to see if they were delayed my sister then told me that they would be there in more minutes it was a really hot day i live in new mexico and i sat there for minutes and seconds so today i decided to have myself petty revenge they get in the car i tell them i was waiting for minutes and seconds so im going to make them wait as long as i did they complained a little here and there but i was tired and just relaxed they tried calling my mom and dad but my dad is visiting family in arizona and my mom was at a meeting in another town so reluctantly they waited the whole minutes and seconds they hear the timer go off i started counting as soon as i parked i am tired of this shit and ask if we can go home i am going to take a nap they were upset and demanded that i take them home well be home soon itll only be minutes minutes later they are pissed sister is screaming at me while my brother kicks me from the back seat they demand for me to take them home okay just give me more minutes so they not only waited minutes and seconds as they expected i made them wait another minutes and seconds hopefully this teaches them to call when they are actually there tldr brother and sister made me wait in a parking lot on a hot day so i returned the favor 
to set this up you need to understand that im partially sighted i can read fine and navigate ok in most lighting but i dont see much in low light and my peripheral vision is poor i usually avoid stairs if i can my ride to work drops me off in a parking structure that has elevators but on this morning i was running late and the elevators are slow stairs it is as i head over there i realize my shoe is untied so i stop at the top of the steps and start tying i hear someone come up next to me so i explain that im not very quick on stairs and they should go ahead i hear a young womans voice i dont want some old man following me and staring at my ass ok i finish with my shoelace then pull out and deploy my folding white guide cane find the edge of the first step and work my way down i will admit that i could have done it faster even though i dont have to i continued to use it as i walked over to the office building entered and waited for an elevator she was completely silent but i could hear her high heels behind me the whole time i made some small talk with another woman that was already waiting and when the elevator got there she and i entered she called to the woman from the stairs but she didnt move or say anything whats her problem shes worried im going to stare at her behind seriously then the door closed
as a student in high school i was a pretty smart kid i was holding a without trying in high school rarely studied but senior year rolls around and im taking physics i actually had to study in that class but during class i showed no effort to stay with the class or the teacher basically slept in every class and homework showed minimal effort that was just my style in high school so final exam time comes i come into class flipping through some note cards i had made for studying had some formulas on there and so forth put those into my bag and sat down finished up the exam got up to turn in my exam and he whispers in my ear so volatilebeans if i look in your bag will i find some cheat sheets ends up going through my crap finding the note cards then telling the dean i cheated obviously they are going to believe the teacher so basically i ended up getting a zero on the final when i get done talking to the dean i walk back into class and everyone is gone cause its next period i go up to get my stuff he smiles smugly at me and goes maybe when youre in college youll learn a little respect ended up getting a c for my final grade obviously i was pissed i graduated and ended up going to a college in my area now im in my sophomore year and going up the elevator to get to my class i dont know how elevators are at other colleges but at mine they are packed anytime a period gets over or is about to start im waiting for the elevator and low and behold i see that physics teacher walking toward the crowd of students waiting to get on an elevator hes pushing a cart that has some lab equipment on it and a projector i guess he got a job there as a physics teacher scumbag so the students notice this and being the respectable chaps they are upon entering the elevator they leave enough room for him and his cart to get on theres like students still waiting i was one of them as he starts pushing his cart to the elevator i cut him off get on the elevator and turn back to face him now theres not enough room for him and his cart obviously hes slightly confused and a wee bit upset he stares at me and i watched as his expression changed to recognition of whom i was i stare him dead in the eye and say maybe when you taught high school you shouldve learned a little respect and pressed the button to close the doors so petty and yet so satisfying tldr teacher accused me of cheating gave me a on final exam years later i cock block him on elevator petty revenge edit jesus thank you all for the karma 
in i was a young comedian in new york city and i secured an audition at one of the citys top clubs their host would watch a few of us audition before the pros came on and shed recommend anyone she liked to become a regular at the club i was super excited and spent weeks crafting the set i wanted her to see my first joke did okay but my second was stronger and by the end i was crushing i finished with a big applause break and said good night but the host was nowhere to be found i called out for her twice and joked that i must have done so well that they gave me more time before she finally came back up i realized she probably wasnt watching my set or shed have known when i was finished her phony feedback after the show made it worse you started strong she said but you faded at the end why couldnt she have just told me she got distracted and offered me another audition in the future why couldnt she be an adult about it i wanted to be sure that she was lying so despite having done no subway material i asked her what she thought about my subway material she told me it was generic not only was she lying to me but now in her lie i was a bad comic i was furious but i politely thanked her for her time knowing that there was nothing i could do thankfully other clubs were more responsible with their new talent and i got the regular stage time i needed to grow a few years later i was on the late late show and things continued to progress in i opened my own comedy club in new york city during construction a woman came in to ask if we were hiring a new talent director i recognized her immediately but she clearly had no recollection of every meeting me before i asked her for her resume with absolutely no intention of ever reading it like shed metaphorically done to me years earlier and then i politely thanked her for her time knowing that there was nothing she could do tldr when you keep your head down and do good work the universe will get petty revenge for you 
im driving down a freeway in evening rush hour in san diego and decide to use my wipers and the wiper fluid for seconds the lady feet behind me apparently caught a little of my wiper fluid on her suv windshield not intentional on my part so she speeds up apparently in a rage about a bad day or whatever pulls in front of me and turns on her own wipers and wiper fluid to get me back then she suddenly turns on her right turn signal three lanes on each side of the road were in the left most lane but a tractor trailer truck wheeler is pulling past and she tries to get over to get off at the exit almost stops in the freeway to let a car go by so she can get over shes now in the middle lane then realizes she has to keep going past the exit so since im still in the left most lane i pass her and am dancing happily to music with my arms as visibly as possible i hope she was able to get a massage or glass of wine or something
i was really quiet growing up teachers loved me because i did well in class and didnt cause a fuss i had an earth science class in th grade where about students would sit around each table one kid at my table lets call him mildlyannoyingtwat would tease me nothing terrible but it did get awfully repetitive and annoying one day while the teacher had his back to the class writing on the board i let out a loud one beat whistle the teacher says whoever that was knock it off taking the cue i let out another of course mildlyannoyingtwat found this kind of thing hilarious so he was cracking up when the teacher turned around making him look very guilty i had my usual blank look on and just glanced over at mildlyannoyingtwat the teacher pointedly tells him to stop mildlyannoyingtwat blames it on me but the teacher doesnt buy it when the next opportunity came around i let out another whistle the teacher had had it at this point and yells mildyannoyingtwat what did i just tell you to do he counters it was pooptownllc the rest of the table stayed silent because he was a mildly annoying twat to everyone at the table so they had my back that was when the teacher came up with his brilliant plan he said i know how we can find out who did it why dont i send you out into the hall and see if the whistling stops damn right it stopped
this is an xpost from rtalesfromretail a commenter thought i should post it here ill remove if it doesnt belong background i own and operate my own retail store its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before its square foot of fireworks heaven ive posted a few other stories if youre interested story a guy came in to pick up some fireworks he was having a party and wanted to put on an impressive show for his friends i spent about minutes walking him through the store explaining the different items to him and showing him videos of the stuff to help him pick out exactly what he wanted he mentioned a couple of times how he usually goes to ltother storegt and how their prices were cheaper each time id apologized but i let him know that our prices were usually less than theirs and that i thought that we had beat them on each of the items in question the third time it happened i walked to our counter and grabbed the new catalog from ltother storegt i found the stuff he had mentioned and showed him how we were in fact cheaper on every item that he had selected and thats why i keep catalogs from my competitors on the counter in fact on a couple of items we were about half of ltother storegt price amazingly he didnt seem happy about it but he kept shopping by the time he was ready to check out he had a rolling flat cart full of stuff it was mostly large assortment packages finale cakes and big mortar kits with a few smaller items here and there to speed things up and prevent us from having to unload all the big kits onto the counter i started calling out the prices for the bigger items to the cashier my dad about halfway through i got to one of the largest items a massive mortar kit and called out the price of when my dad was ringing it in the register display looked like it had screwed up so i stopped him and went to check it out sure enough the item had rung in at while im talking to my dad about it the customer walks over and demands to see the mistake i show him that the last entry was for instead of he immediately tells me that i have to sell the item to him at the price that rang up i showed him that the item itself had the correct price tag on it and that the cashier had just misskeyed it when he had rung it in the guy gets agitated and repeatedly starts telling me that i have to legally sell the thing to him at that price since the cashier had rung it in like that i calmly explained that if the item had been priced wrong i would sell it to him at the incorrect price but since it was just a misskey we would just void the last item rung in and do it again now armchair lawyer guy alg starts yelling that he knows his rights and that im breaking the law if i have the cashier change the price and i dont sell it to him at the wrong price now ive had the staff screw up before when doing pricing and if we put the wrong lower price tag on something thats what im going to sell it to you for i also know that unless its an advertised price i dont legally have to do it but if i screwed up im going to eat that mistake and reprice the item after were done side note to josh c happy birthday today and next time pay attention to the damn price list when youre using the price gun because i know most of these screwups have your name on them also go back to school and dont do drugs me are you telling me that legally even if we screwed up i cant have the cashier fix a mistake and that i have to sell you the item at whatever price was keyed into the register alg yes me looking at my dad i guess were going to have to charge him whatever you keyed in i calmly walked back around the counter and picked up another item from his cart a small fountain with a price tag of and continued calling out the prices when we were all done my dad gave him the total alg that cant be right thats way too much theres no way i got that much stuff dad oops looks like the fountain rang in for did you want to pay that in cash or with a credit card alg just glared at my dad for a few seconds then quietly asked if we could fix it we happily fixed both mistakes boxed up his items and sent him on his way with a smile
i am genuinely gutted that i wont see the outcome of this piece of pettiness but i can imagine and am praying that it will be glorious anyways i finally went to see deadpool over the weekend i purposely waited an entire month before seeing it just so that everyone and their grandmas would have watched it and i could watch it in peace i swear i must have been some kind of cunt in a past life because only then could this kind of karma come to bite me in the arse a full fifteen minutes into the damn movie a man and woman walk in with i shit you not no less than forty prepubescent kids who then make so much noise trying to find seats for the next few minutes they were mostly girls but there were a few boys these twats fucked up the entire rest of the movie tits on the screen cacophony of ewws and gross every damn time wade getting pegged same thing every time something remotely badass happened clapping what was even more rage inducing was that the actual funny adult jokes flew completely over their little insignificant minds now im on the brink of losing my shit and shouting at the top of lungs for these little missed abortions to shut up and then wade makes a joke about a dildo i cant remember the one exactly this clearly peaks the interest of the split condom result sitting next to me who was a boy who then asks me a complete stranger what exactly a dildo is im absolutely seething so i say to the little fucker you see those two big black sticks on deadpools back those are dildos make sure to buy the toys and also to beg your parents that you want the big black ones twat believes me and i watch the rest of the movie cursing the very existence of two imbeciles who thought it was a good idea to bring any kids at all to see deadpool after the credits have to stay for post credits scene i walk out of the theatre to see the little fucker bragging to all his cumstain friends that his birthday is coming up soon as well and hes going to ask his parents to buy him deadpools dildos instead of going to see a movie im hoping that every one of them also went home and asked their dickhead parents to buy them big black dildos

i had a house party at mine last saturday night a few hours into it a few people suggested we do a pizzaliquor run theres a strip of shops about a minute drive from mine which has a pizza place and a liquor store amongst them i called up the pizza place and placed a pickup order for pizzas a few mates and i got into my car we got one of the dds to drive us and made our way to the strip of shops i went to the pizza place to get the pizzas while the others went into the liquor store i got to the counter and told them i was picking up a phone order the total came to everynight on tv and in newspapers theres always ads for this pizza place advertising pickup pizzas i asked the guy how come it came to when it should be he snapped at me that it was only for orders placed online or through their iphoneandroid app which im pretty sure isnt correct and told me to know my facts before questioning him i wouldnt normally care about an extra pizza but the fact that he snapped at me and i was slightly intoxicated meant something had to be done i turned around and sat down inside the store on one of the wooden benches the guy came over and asked me if i was going to pay for the pizzas i said i was and that i was just waiting for a mate to come with the money while he went away to serve other customersmake other pizzas i got my iphone out of my pocket logged into the app store and downloaded their iphone app within a matter of minutes i used the app to make a pickup order for the exact same pizzas and paid the total online using my debit card i went back up the counter and told him that i was picking up an online order he realised what i had done turned around and got the pizzas and put them on the counter for me one of my mates came in and helped me carry them back to the car as i was leaving i turned around and said thanks have a good night tldr rude pizza cashier tries to charge me extra for not ordering through their app download pizza app whilst at store and make same exact order to save 
the wife and i have had a busy year we bought a house in march and then we had our first child a baby girl in late september since we had lived in apartments throughout our entire relationship this was our first halloween that we expected to get any trickortreaters my wife was of course thrilled and went out and bought a crap ton of full size candy bars because she wants the reputation of that house so that more kids visit so she can see their cute costumes the only issue with this plan was that we have a newborn and two dogs that go apeshit whenever the doorbell is even looked at to try and reduce the number of barking fits that trigger a crying baby we kenneled the dogs upstairs in our bedroom and put a sign next to our doorbell that said please do not ring the doorbell barking dogs and sleeping newborn inside our front door is visible from our living room so if we left the solid door open and the storm door closed we would have no issue seeing if anyone was waiting for candy at the beginning of the night the system worked with no issues the baby was content and never startled i held onto her and my wife would greet the children at the door and offer to let them choose two full goddamn size candy bars because she loves children and halloween and just wants them to have a great time around oclock the baby finally fell asleep so i put her in her bassinet so i could take a break from baby duty and hand out candy myself thats when he showed up this child in a bleeding ghostface mask walked up to our porch and stood in front of the storm door i saw him he saw me with a smile i got up and started to walk towards him as i approached the kid broke eye contact and started reading the sign above the doorbell then the little shit reached up with his spindly little fingers and fucking rang the goddamn doorbell the dogs lost their shit and started barking like an intruder was on their way inside to murder the family this of course woke up the sleeping baby who of course began to cry the smile my face held quickly fell to pissed off glare as i walked towards the door to reward this little asshole with some candy as i reached for the bowl filled with full sized candy bars i noticed the treat i received at the office the day before that i had lazily neglected to throw away i grabbed it and threw it on top of the bowl with the rest of the candy i opened the door with a smile holding the bowl of goodies at his eye level trickortreat he said with glee as he held out his bag and eyefucked the candy that i held before him happy halloween i said back as the baby screamed in the background it was here that i did not let him take two candy bars i didnt even let him take one candy bar instead i reached into the bowl myself picked up the lone fun sized bag of candy corn and dropped it into his outstretched bag he looked the candy into his bag then looked back up at the bowl filled with full sized reeses snickers kitkats and mampms then he looked at me after a moments pause he whimpered out a half assed thank you and trudged down the steps towards the culdesac have a safe night i yelled after him as i closed the door and went to console my crying daughter and assure my dogs that no one was being murdered tldr ring the goddamn doorbell and you get rewarded with candy corn you stupid dick spank child
okay a little while back i was an hvac technician working for a company here in the limp wang of the country florida while schlepping myself around repairing installing duct taping and in general making shit happen in a all together too sweaty living ive met many different kinds of people some love it when you show up because theyre sweaty and miserable and they know youll make them as frosty as an ice queen by the time you blow out of there and others just fucking hate you because you happen to be the avatar of their cheapness come to visit them in their hour of defeat now when installing an ac system legally you need to have it inspected by the county or city building dept usually these inspections are cursory at best and a real bear if youve drawn a pissed off inspector or if not pissed off someone looking for a bribethis is florida bribery is a part of life this day i drew a man looking for a bigger than normal bribe typically its this guy wanted shit my takehome on the job was only and i wasnt about to split that with an overzealous asshole with a clipboard i refused to pay and he struck my inspection card with the big red pen this meant that he found everything incorrectly installed even if he didnt look the miserable fuck this meant i had to reapply for another inspection at the first ones free so this asshole had cost me time and money this meant vengeance so i waited a couple weeks and followed him home from a busy day of gouging blue collar guys plying their trade skills i still hadnt formulated what i wanted to do to him but it was going to be fucking rude thankfully he lived alone on a busy street but not many other houses and some long lines of sight perfect so i watched and waited hearing stories from other guys about him the numbers never changed really except they got more expensive the bigger the job that fuck when he left for work one morning and i didnt have anything to do i slipped on my coveralls with the city public works dept logo slapped on the back and did the measuring on his windows and doors wood framed house no siding that stuck out too far good strong timbers perfect took note of where his water meter was and checked what type of electrical meter system he had all easily accessible i worked a few construction sites over the next few weeks and collected some sheets of leftover plywood not the lightweight stuff but heavy fire rated sheathing the sheets i cut to size from the measurements i took earlier on i stowed these pieces one by one and collected a few other things finally the day of reckoning had come id had another runin with that greedy fuck and again i refused to pay the exorbitant bribe rates that was the last fucking straw i waited until the next week which was a government holiday day weekend that sort of thing either way the very places hed need to call would be closed to deal with the shitstorm that was coming he trundled off to work that morning while i was watching from down the road in a rented white pickup truck filled with precut wood and my framing tools again i was in my faux city coveralls and hard hat i backed the truck right up and started setting the wood panels around the house corresponding to their measurements once those were set up i started whacking them in with the framer as fast as i could with plenty of extra nails windows and doors front and back boarded up as tight as you could please then i moved on to the electrical meter can and pulled that free padlocking the panel shut then it was off to the water meter which i shut down and detached that was padlocked shut too the meters went into a cardboard box and into the truck for the coup de grace i slapped up building condemned by court order and caution hazardous materials within sticker signs on the plywood window covers and a faked but real court order on the front door declaring the house unsafe because of methamphetamine production you come across this kind of stuff in the course of your days doing construction and if you find extras why not grab em i then cleaned up my work made sure everything looked kosher and hauled ass for a publix sub i needed to be back there to watch the festivities after getting lunch and ditching the extra tools back at the house i chilled out and sat in a parking lot down the road with a pair of binoculars and a good book i didnt wait long as my target came home early and was completely floored at seeing his house boarded up with those horrid green and orange stickers all over the place i watched him call the cops and when they showed up there was much pointing at the signs and eventually they left without pulling the wood off the court order looked way too real and the clerks office was already gone for the weekend so there wasnt anyone to confirm it was a fake this was part of the plan i watched him try to pull the wood off and since i used way too many nails he just couldnt do it i smiled so hard i thought my face would crack it was beautiful watching that man have a breakdown in his front yard enjoying the schadenfreude from a half mile away poetry i drove away after watching for as long as i dared and spent the weekend enjoying life and doing service calls i still smile when i think of that day the inspector was fired a couple years later by the city when people started really bitching about the bribery accusations tldr guy wanted a bribe pissed me off i condemned his house
i will preface this with when riding a motorcycle in california it is permitted not legal not illegal to split a lane drive down the middle of two lanes slowly to reach the front of a stopped line of cars i was pulling up to an intersection and there were cars and i decided to split them to get to the front of the line the right car was in a right turn only lane the man in the right car decided he didnt like this and reached out and tried to grab my helmet as i passed his car doing this caused my head to snap back and i had to slam on the brakes to stop from going into the intersection with my head back i was quite upset but i remained calm looked at him and asked him why he thought it was ok to try and kill me he laughed and said dont let me ever see you do that again faggot i smiled looked at him in the eyes and asked him if he was hitting on me and if he wanted to go on a date later he did not like this and decided to spit in my face i was raging now staring at him unsure what i should do so i put my visor down on my helmet leaned in close and slammed the top of my helmet on his partially open window it smashed into pieces as i dropped the clutch and sped out of there he tried to follow me but got caught in the intersection because he was in a right turn lane trying to go straight broke a piece of my helmet but it was worth it i can still hear the sound of the broken glass 
the wife and i were having some problems in our marriage and then she decides to have sex with a guy lets call him michael while i was in the house twice obviously we are getting divorced but i had to do something more im a computer technician so i decided to take revenge using my it knowledge i waited until michael was in the house one day and looked at the attached devices on our network thus i was able to get his iphones mac address then i gave his phone an ip reservation on the network and blocked all ports to that ip address basically now his phone will not get internet access on our wifi despite having a valid not self assigned ip address now the soontobe exwife is in a tough situation because she doesnt know enough about networks to solve the problem and im pretty much the only person who could help her fix it thus she would have to ask for my help in which case i will thoroughly enjoy telling her to go to hell of course she could easily fix this by simply resetting the router to factory settings but then she would have to configure everything again and she doesnt know how to do so i like this because i get to take revenge on both of them on michael by making his phones internet not work on our network and on the wife by putting her in this awkward situation and by making her waste a lot of time trying to figure it out i could do the same to all of her devices but then she would probably more quickly realize that its a router problem and she would probably realize it was something i did this way theres a much stronger chance from a troubleshooting perspective that its a problem with his phone since everything else works just fine
ok so one thing that seems to be reaching epidemic proportions in my town is the number of bags people mostly women for some reason seem to bring with them on their daily commute enter bag lady bl who had a gym bag a purse a bag full of what seemed to be numerous pairs of shoes a plastic bag with newspapers and reading materials a bag with what appeared to be her lunch bags one professionally dressed woman seems excessive but whatever bl decides to stand on the train in front of the doors now this bugs me when anyone does it never mind this urban sherpa so as people are exiting her bags are getting bumped and shes getting a head of steam on she starts telling people to watch out and gets pretty belligerent with a few passengers someone tells her to move out of the doorway and her response was i was here first wtf bl are you or something anyway my turn to exit is coming up so i position myself so im last to get off i time it so the doors are just starting to close as i exit and as i do i pinch the nearest plastic bag and drag it out the door with me the doors close and i hit it perfect the portion stuck in the door was thin enough that it didnt set off the autoopen and as i watched the train pull away all i saw was an undulating plastic bag slamming against the outside of the door slowly leaking papers everywhere tldr woman with multiple bags wouldnt move i made her lose one of the bags
 sorry for the wall of text there is a tldr at the bottom this happened about years ago it was a few days after christmas and id been sent out to repair some equipment at a kmart store the job went well and id already loaded my truck and cleaned up all i had left to do was get a managers signature on my paperwork i stopped at the customer service desk and asked for him to be paged then waited for him to show up i was still standing there with my clip board not really paying attention to much of anything when this little old lady walks in the door noticed my uniform and started heading my way i should backtrack here and mention a couple of things the first being my employer had changed our uniforms about months earlier to a design that made me look like an assistant manager at every single store i set foot in people were always stopping me asking where things were or something similar i even had people stop me at a fast food chain on my lunch break to complain about something or other i wasnt really annoyed by it most of the time i thought it was funny the second thing i need to mention is while you cant judge a book by its cover you can sometimes tell a lot about a person by their face the little old lady in this story was no exception her face looked like the last smile that had graced it had been sometime during the eisenhower administration i started to tell her that i didnt work there i got as far as im sorry maam before she barked at me to shut up sonny and listen to me for a minute that is a direct quote to this day im not sure if i shut up because i was shocked at her rudeness or just because my brain was trying to work out whether or not i had actually heard someone use the term sonny in actual conversation she took advantage of my stunned silence to launch into a diatribe about her experience the last time she shopped there something about coupons and how her stuff was bagged etc etc etc when she paused for a moment to take a breath i tried to tell her again that i didnt work there maam i cant she interrupted me by screaming i said shut up then launches into her diatribe again now i tend to avoid confrontations but i can usually hold my own this old bat had just dragged me into uncharted territory though nothing in my life up to that point has prepared me to deal with a screaming elderly woman half my size i was more than half afraid she was going to have a stroke right there on the spot i let her run down a bit and tried again a bit louder maam i dont wor she then tries to clamp her bony hand over my mouth i had to fend her off by holding my clipboard in front of my face at that moment some of my grandpas wisdom came to the rescue i remember him telling me once that when someone is that angry anything you say will only make them worse if you just calmly stand there and let them rant until they wind down then you can deal with them the best part is they dont get much satisfaction out of it and they end up looking like an even bigger jerk than they would if you had yelled back so i made up my mind to just stand there nodding and listening until she stopped again i kept my mouth shut she stared at me for a long moment and then says pointedly well i responded with a mild well what old lady arent you gonna help me i keep my voice calm but speak louder than absolutely necessary no but if you want my opinion id go talk to someone who works here finally her eyes darted to the logo on my uniform shirt and widened a bit when she realizes that it did not say kmart i suddenly realized how quiet it has gotten a quick glance over my shoulder revealed everyone within earshot had stopped to watch the show with with all the screaming on her part that included pretty much everyone in the front half of a store that was already busy with people making returns and people buying whole cart loads of christmas clearance items someone snorted another made a choking noise and then the laughter started it hadnt struck me as funny up to that point but when it did it was all i could do to control myself she glanced around opened her mouth and closed it as if she started to say something then thought better of it after a few seconds she turned around and marched herself right back out the wrong way through the entrance door without so much as a muttered apology thanks for the advice grandpa you were a far wiser man than i ever realized tldr old lady screams at me and interrupts me multiple times when i try to tell her that i dont work there so i let her make a fool of herself in front of a crowd 
my landlord is the cheapest man ive ever met and im actually in the process of looking for a new place to live but while im still here i figured id have some fun my apartment is right next to my landlords apartment except his back door is about a foot walk away from my front door which is totally fine im a pretty lowkey person i dont host parties and i dont play loud music at odd hours of the night my rent has always been on time and if anything broke in the apartment i went and fixed it myself the last two months my landlord has lost my rent check and then given me a very hard time about not getting my rent in on time the thing is i use a third party that gives me emails when the money is taken out of my account when the check is mailed and the carrier that delivers the check to my landlords doorstep because he wouldnt allow me to personally put it in his mailbox even though its feet away so i knew my landlord was trying to mess with me because im fairly young and he figured i didnt have the experience to know what was going on legally he was within his rights as a landlord as long as he didnt cash both checks so he was just making my life difficult heres where i decided to get petty aside from claiming to not have received my checks hes been using my front porch as his place to saw wood and do construction shit for his apartment the last month or so without consulting me about it he would completely obstruct the stairs and walkway to my front door with piles of sawdust and massive pieces of wood my girlfriend hit her head walking up to my apartment because one of the construction guys swung around a big piece of wood and didnt see her walking there i decided to do something about it the construction guy my landlord hired to do all this work doesnt have a key to the front gate that automatically locks when closed so that gate would be propped open whenever id come home from class every single time i would come home and close the gate so the construction guy would have to call my landlord and make him walk down the stairs and unlock it for him i could hear him cursing and saying i know i left it open for you i dont know who the fuck keeps closing it its me asshole i know you think im too young and naive to know youre trying to take advantage of me so enjoy a little forced exercise you fucking used dildo 
a lady butted in front of me at the other day she placed a snickers bar on the counter then walked over to the potato chip rack for some chips before returning to ring in her purchase in those few seconds i picked up her snickers bar and snapped it in half inside the package im not even sorry 
i used to work in a hour fast food joint by a popular club at about closing time wed get the overflow of drunks most just wanted a greasy snack before they went home and probably were perfectly civil and hilarious however as many who serve the late night drunk crowd know there are douchebags that seek to bolster their self esteem and social standing by harassing easy targets like fast food workers who have to switch off their verbal self defence mechanisms to provide good customer service we had a regular who would spend his time hitting on customers and staff me on one occasion after what was probably another night of disappointment he clearly thought he was charming we named him tle the lynx effect after an advertising slogan for a deodorant named lynx which is the australian branding for axe body spray tle would hang out in the dining room sometimes with a crowd of friends that he would play to after being politely told to stop standing on the seats tle decides he wants a burger so he orders some monstrosity loaded with a stupid amount of bacon that he expects kudos for ordering i give kudos for bacon not wasted bacon when it comes time to pay tle opens his wallet and finds only a parking ticket and a condom he hands the condom across and says you accept these as payment right cue polite laughter without a beat my surpressed verbal defences kick in usually sir however not when theyve clearly been in your wallet for so long he was stunned his mates laughed and my manager at the time had to hide in the backroom lest someone saw her game face drop after that some lady whom he had been clumsily hitting on asked if i accepted tips petty but satisfying

i usually cook lunch for my pregnant wife to take to school but today she had a seminar and pizza was provided my wife is a petite woman and the pregnancy is still early so the baby bump isnt showing but her appetite is everyone in front of her all guys were taking slices of pizza so my wife also takes slices this apparently upsets a professor behind her and he makes a snide remark about it well my wife is a bit bummed out by his commentsso i got the professors name and found his email guess who just got subscribed to all the newsletterscouponsoffers for all the pizza restaurants near the university tldr professor makes a comment about my pregnant wifes appetite saved him money with all the coupons he will be receiving edit wow didnt expect so much response to answer some of the questions it wasnt her professor it was just a professor from the department the seminar was a department seminar where students and faculty gather and pizza was provided by the department the pizza was from dominos and was like a medium pizza cut into slicesso slices wasnt that much my wife is nonconfrontationalwhen she heard the comment she apologized and offered to return the pizza to the table but he just walked away there was still plenty of pizza left on the table and usually the department pizza seminars have left overs i was pissed when she texted me after it happened because the guys in front of my wife all took slices but he just singled her out she also told me not to do anything dumb as revengeso i went the petty route
four years ago i got paired up with this truly awful girl in my first year of college we were polar opposites she was your typical stuck up snotty rich girl and i was a shy quiet nerdy girl her parents bought her everything even a car and gas to go in it my family was hella poor and i bought my own car we only shared a room for four days she spent of that time making fun of my old car my interests my hobbies my music my hair basically anything she could think of these dorms are tiny about by with only a sink two desks and two twin beds for furniture so when she wanted her boyfriend to spend the night i was more than a little uncomfortable especially since they liked to fool around and thought i couldnt hear it from literally feet away after complaining to my ra several times we were both brought into a meeting with the housing director he decided that i should be the one to change rooms because not wanting her boyfriend spending the night more than twice a week was unreasonable i later found out her parents had talked to him earlier that day and bribed him so that one of her friends could live with her instead so i got moved to the room next door she had left town that night thank god and as i was packing up my stuff i thought of something i could do to get back at her i grabbed a can of tuna i had in my cupboard punched a hole in it and spit in it then i stuck it on top of the ceiling tiles right above her bed about two weeks later i walk past her room on my way to mine and see the door wide open with her and four of her friends tearing the room apart desperately trying to figure out where this horrible smell was coming from the housing director called me to his office the next day and asked if i was the one who did it and warned i would be in trouble if i lied i lied and said i had no idea what they were talking about got off scot free
a few years back i took a girl on a date to the macaroni grill the waiter a good looking broseph type came over eventually and was immediately pretty friendly towards my girl who id been seeing for a few months at that point it was offputting but im a pretty mellow guy and she and i were having fun so i didnt think much of it she noticed it too and we joked about it as he got our drinks she decides she wants to go with it see if we can get a good laugh from it were both really into pranks he comes back with the drinks and i assume because i was acting beta as fuck actually starts hitting on her in front of me not in an offensive way but it was clear what was up and had she and i not already been really close it would have been very uncomfortable he brags to my date that he can write his name upside down which he does on our table he then says that hes been practicing writing his phone number upside down too but he needs more practice he then writes his number down under his name upside down to him but oriented straight towards my date more onesided flirting as he takes our orders and leaves she was actually pretty great and was subtly messing with him and hinting that shes into some weird stuff at this point i text my friend who works at this place during college semesters turns out shes there working that night and i track her down and explain that one of her wait staff is hitting on my girl directly in front of me her immediate reaction oh god its barry isnt it it was hes apparently known for this type of thing she apologizes and asks how id like it handled comped drinks talking to barry etc i tell her what my date and i had planned barry continues his behavior for the remainder of the evening and my date continues with her friendly freaky subterfuge i eventually pay the check and my date leaves the tip with a note give me a call sometime make it dirty beck she jots down the assistant managers phone number on the note and we take off days later my friend gets back to me with the results he called her up thinking it was b he leads off with so you ready to let a real man take you to dinner or does your freak self want to skip right to bed classy my friend tells him what really happened and that he can explain his behavior to the manager or she will he never came back to work after that beta as fuck tldr tricked a flirty waiter into sexually harassing his assistant manager side note i got this idea from someone we pranked in high school short version is a jerk wannabegangster student thought he was leaving a pager voicemail for a girl that was into him when it was really our friend trishs pager who had no idea about any of this next thing she knows she has a nasty long voicemail from this strange kid shes never met it was a solid seconds of an awkward inexperienced high school student trying to sound like a sexual gangster some of the shit he said made no sense at all many laughs were had and im happy to say that it stopped there we didnt use it to publicly shame the kid at school

both myself and my husband like the toilet paper roll hanging over not under ive noticed recently that whenever the toilet paper roll runs out he grabs one from under the sink but instead of changing it leaves it on top of the sink why he doesnt take the one second to change it i have no idea so when i go in there next i always have to do it ive started hanging the new roll so the toilet paper goes under instead of over he always complains about it and asks me why i do it i tell him i like it better that way he always changes it back this way he has to change the roll and i get a chance to irritate him as much as he irritates me and it winds up the way i like it anyways 
i paid off a bank loan only to receive a bill a few weeks for less than i went to my bank to inquire about it and see if they would waive the fee it turns out it was interest on the small amount still owing interest from the st of the month until the th when i paid it off in full after being told there was nothing they would do by both the teller and manager i closed all my accounts switched to another bank and paid an extra on top of the i still owed now i have a positive balance and they have to keep mailing me monthly statements which will cost them way more than the in the long run edit this happened almost a year ago so unfortunately they stopped sending statements after a few months and now i have an unopened cheque for i think might be that i refuse to cash and i believe theyll have to reissue every months and im also canadian so our banking laws are different up here sorry aboot that eh 
today i parked my car in the same garage that i always use when i go to classes downtown as per usual it was near full around am as i was driving through the garage there was a stereotypical business jock yelling into his bluetooth gelled hair expensive suit froofy starbucks in hand driving behind me in his black mercedes suv he was obviously late since he was tailgating me the entire time i finally found a spot and i hit my blinker and slowed down i wanted to back in so i went a bit past the spot first to get into position business jock decided his time was more important than mine and that he didnt want me to park in that spot so he pulled up on my ass and started blaring the horn gesturing for me to keep moving etc i sat there for a second before throwing it in reverse obviously he could see my reverse lights but he refused to move until i said fuck it and started backing up i figure if you dont want to get hit youll move so anyway he moves and i take my time getting into the tight spot he drives off and i think the interaction is over i got into the elevator and as im pressing the g button ground level i see him running around the corner trying to catch the elevator i smiled waved and pressed the close doors button which shined shone like a glowing beacon a token of good faith from the gods of revenge and watched as his face twisted in rage as i rode the elevator up i decided i wasnt done i reached my floor then sent the elevator up to every single floor in the tall tall tall building enjoy the wait asshole
i was asked to post this here for your enjoyment so here you go i wish id found this subreddit sooner my pettiness knows no bounds i had a downstairs neighbor who would constantly blast their soundsystem late into the night we complained but they just didnt fucking care they would just shrug their shoulders and then close the doorin our faces on a trip to amsterdam i bought a pair of wooden shoes as a souvenier and started wearing them in my uncarpeted apartment i wore them as if they were house slippers all the time bathroom trip at in the morning slip on them clogs 
back when i was in the sixth grade my mom would always pack my lunch for me during class we were to leave our backpacks in the hallway my lunchbox was always inside my backpack for a few days i found it odd that my mom was just packing me carrots fruit veggies or celery sticks and an ice pack she usually made some kickass lunches with pb and fluff sandwiches yoohoo and always a snack i told her about this and she said that shed been packing my normal lunch as always someone was stealing my shit it happened the next couple days she would tell me what she packed and id watch for it we think it was someone with a different lunch schedule and couldnt find out who and school staff was useless so my mom decided to step it up the next day my mom made my normal lunch with one caveat the doritos were nicely tossed in some cayenne powder my roast beef on my sandwich was nicely marinated overnight in some ghost pepper hot sauce my lunch was stolen again that day but at last bell the doritos and sandwich were tossed unwrapped back in my backpack it wrecked some papers and i had to wash my backpack but my lunch was never stolen again so to whoever stole my lunch i hope your mouth still burns edited for the pepper connoisseurs it was daves insanity marinated roast beef which i guess was not made from ghosts 
there is an elementary school in my neighborhood on a street that is normally mph but twice a day it slows to there are tons of flashing lights and signs everywhere its nearly impossible not to notice that this is a school zone the zone lasts about blocks in the past three years three kids have died in separate incidents as a result of speeding vehicles in this school zone there are little memorials along the side of the road like a small graveyard this zone is also routinely patrolled by cops about days out of the days of the week that the school zone lights are flashing you will find cops parked on a particular side street clocking drivers last week some lady came speeding up on me in this school zone while the lights were flashing there was a van in the lane next to me it was partially alongside my vehicle but slightly ahead of me so she whipped into that lane and pulled up on his butt her front bumper was just to the left of my window and as such i could easily see that his rear bumper was less than a foot in front of her front bumper she was stupidly close even for only mph she began gesticulating and visibly screaming and probably spraying spittle on her dash she obviously felt that it was an extreme inconvenience to her that we werent speeding i kept my speed steady to match the van next to me just because i have no patience for people behaving this way and i was not inclined to reward her by letting her pass the longer this went on the more enraged she became i was bent on keeping her from passing at this point just out of spite but when we were about three blocks from the side street where the cops hide out i changed my mind i dropped my speed and let her gain on me by this point she was so enraged that as soon as she thought she was clear of my front bumper she swerved over into my lane with no signal cutting me off and hit the gas in a show of victory she was accelerating so rapidly that she was probably doing at least mph when she passed the motorcycle cops you could tell exactly when she noticed them because she hit the brakes so hard that her car visibly swerved i tried not to smile too smugly as i watched getting pulled over good luck getting to work on time now lady oh yeah and a ticket for going double the posted speed in a school zone with mandatory doubled fines good thing you can afford a lexus
this one is a few years old but it was so weird i never forgot it my wife wasnt feeling well so i went to the store to pick up a few things while i waited for her prescription to be filled among the things i was picking up was a jumbo size bag of cat food which was almost at the back of the store i already had this in my cart and had stopped near the front of the store not too far from the entrance i stepped maybe feet away from my cart to grab something when this woman talking on a bluetooth headset walks up to my cart and snags the bag of cat food i thought that was pretty odd who walks into a grocery store and grabs things out of another persons shopping cart somewhat amused and a little irritated i grabbed my cart and began following her she walked straight toward the register carrying the bag chatting away about how busy she was i followed her all the way to the register where she set the bag down i stepped right up snatched the bag and asked why she had taken the cat food out of my cart instead of getting her own i made sure to speak in a conversational tone loud enough that those around us could hear but not so loud as to appear angry or threatening i wonder what the person on the other end of her phone conversation made of that she was obviously surprised and a bit embarrassed about being caught she muttered something about not realizing it was someones cart yeah right even at this point if shed asked id have shrugged it off and let her keep the bag but once she recovered from her initial shock she started acting angry i pointed toward the part of the store where the cat food was kept and suggested she grab a bag of her own she headed off toward the pet food section while i went to check on my wifes prescription at the store pharmacy trying hard not to grin bonus this store has a fairly limited selection of cat food to begin with and id already grabbed the last bag of meow mix edit ouch my inbox is sore i get it meow mix is the official cat food of the nazis and isis ill research some other food alright

today i was parked on a busy road thats pretty narrow the parallel parking spots are pretty limited so you have to get up tight with the other people it was afternoon and hey just my luck the last available space pulled out the parallel parking spots are set up in a little enclave beside the road once all the spots are taken up there remains enough space behind the last vehicle to maybe squeeze in a smart or a motorcycle being in a rather senior part of town this year old neverhadtoworkadayinmylife grandma decided to try to squeeze in her lexus behind the last car my car i was waiting in my car and could tell right away that she was going to hit you know that moment that moment right before you know youre about to win something and youre just waiting for the sparks to fly that was me as her car slowly creaked in beside the inevitable was about to happen shes gonna park her car hit me and leave i know it i know it and thats exactly what happened she hit me not once but twice during her parallel parking escapade at this point i make my sortie shes buried in her phone texting away or something pretending that nothing happened ahh i love it i check the back of my bumper not enough damage to call her out on damn well i can do something petty at least miss selfentitled exits the car and just starts to leave the scene i give her a snarly stink eye trying to not argue or anything as i know what im gonna do i head behind her car and take down her license she then starts yelling at me in the most annoying californian high class prick accent you can think of she goes off hey whats your problem how about the fact that you hit me twice its normal what do you expect its normal for you to hit cars that must be fun she scoffs and leaves now my petty revenge plan begins i eyeball her down all the way down the street about blocks away she turns into some furniture store shes old enough that you can tell its difficult for her to walk far i care not what this lovely bourgeois example of a lady neglected to consider is that i am now impossibly pinned between two cars im going to have to tell her to get over here and move her car however she is also parked completed illegally on the road there was a officer at the street across so i flag him down and get him to get a tow in the mean time i go back to that furniture store and complain at her that she needs to move her car i get her to come back with mejust in time to see her own car getting towed ahh that was sweet 
despite the clear belongs to hip do not use sign it kept happening people are simply too lazy to buy their own so they mooch i filled an old detergent bottle with bleach hope you like the color white bro edit i cant believe theres people actually defending the thieves 
a while ago i worked in a cold storage facility it was a pretty simple but strenuous job the first weeks were physically very difficult the job was order picking basically you go into the f freezer find the ish boxes of frozen food weighing between to lb stack them on a pallet hand wrap it up then put it on the loading dock do an hour for hours and thats the whole job once you got the hang of it and got acclimated to the cold it was a simple job we had alot of employee turnover people a week would come in and quit within weeks too cold or too physically hard the veterans there would usually be friendly but not become attached to a new employee unless it became clear they were going to be staying on to the story one new guy we had took to the work okay he could manage the pallets an hour and it really went to his head he started feeling like the best making fun of the veterans he did better than giving other new guys a hard time complaining about people not working hard enough and always checking on his numbers i referred to him as billcocks and it caught on needless to say he hated me one day he was being particularly bossy so i decided to get a bit of revenge now billcocks was good for a new guy but really had no idea how fast everyone else could be if they wanted to be he peaked at about cases an hour and he would come out of the freezer steaming with effort the average veteran could do without effort i was the best and could pull cph with effort theres no reason to work that hard considering anything over cph was wasted energy we had a warming room where we got our order sheets and people would wait in there for a bit to warm up i spent alot of time in there and billcocks hated that i wasnt working all the time as revenge i started timing my tickets with his i would wait in the warming room until he came in got his order and left then i would sneak out pick my order and go back and sit in the exact same spot billcocks would come in literally steaming see me there and his veins started throbbing get his ticket go out come back and see me still there this happened for about hours to billcocks seeming like i was doing absolutely nothing he told the supervisor who could see exactly what was going on on the computer system supervisor told him to mind his own business he told group leaders who checked the numbers and told him the same thing he never had enough balls to confront me directly so i just kept doing it he raged and slammed boxes but no one would do anything about the horrible injustice of me not working of course everyone else sees me working because i was only timing my tickets with poor billys it was a huge running joke with most people finding it hilarious and no one told him it never occurred to him that someone would be faster than him with less effort he eventually started minding his own business and fit in alot better but he never once said a word to me about it he probably still thinks im somebodies son who could get away with anything
besides my studies ive worked as private tutor in a tutoring school for around two years i help children who are struggling with their homework grammar and whatever the children are children but my boss is a catastrophe im a really patient person i dont complain about his incompetence poor organisational skills and the library which is full of cheap useless books whenever i gave him a book list he asked for it because he wanted to buy new books he did not buy one of mine for around each but rather books for less than in all so i ended up bringing my own books usually i arrive minutes before the lesson and the time ill get paid for starts during all those month it was only three times when i was around minutes late for which he made a huge scene since then i frequently come just in time exactly at pm due to his fantastic organisational skills im often the only tutor in the building a few days ago some pupils were early and a parent arrived nobody was there apart from my boss at pm i entered the building he looked at me angrily did you miss the bus he didnt even greet me i just said im on time he later tried to guilttrip me that it was so embarassing that there werent any tutors when that parent arrived dont you usually come minutes earlier i sometimes do but the lesson starts at pm he couldnt say anything against it cause he knew that i was referring to the contract if he hadnt been an asshle in the past id still be accomodating i dont answer the phone anymore whenever hes calling out of my working days and the best thing is im never late i just spend my time sitting on a bench near the building until its pm he doesnt know that because i like the feeling when he realises that nothing is for granted
i work for a law firm and we handle asset recovery for estates on this case we had an heir who was probably the dumbest person ive ever spoken to we will call him bubba now bubba was the bottom of the totem pole in this huge chain of people getting money the estate was complicated and had crazy people literally mentally ill coming out of the woodwork im pretty sure there must have been a considerable amount of incest in this family to produce so many crazy idiots bubba feels like the best course of action to get his money is to start calling me every day and if i dont answer he hangs up and calls right back over and over again when i do answer i have to repeat the same thing i said the day before to him and to his wife who is usually screaming obscenities in the background and on occasion to his dad fast forward a few months we have completed the estate recovered the asset and mailed out checks to all the heirs heres where my revenge starts the day i put the checks in the mail i start calling bubba about times a day to inform him that we have mailed the check and to ask him if he has received his check when he stops answering i start calling back over and over until he answers after about a week of this hes getting pretty testy on the phone i am overly polite and professional through it all the day he gets his check he answers his phone and yells at me that he got the check i just say good dont call me ever again and i wont call you ever again and i hang up tl dr dont be an annoying asshole and expect me not to do it back edit tl dr guy calls me over and over so i do the same to him
this story happened a few years ago it was the fall quarter of my senior year of college and i fresh back from having the time of my life studying abroad in france everyone who had participated in the international program had taken it extremely seriously being diligent in classes and going out of our way to befriend french students and those who had come from other countries all united by one common language the school i attended back in the states has a fairly large international community particularly with middle eastern and asian students the majority work hard to achieve their language and professional goals in which case i was extremely happy to help if there is confusion in meaning or grammatical structure or if they just wanted a friend to practice with the nostalgia from my experience hit me like a ton of bricks and i did what i could to help those around me be successful unfortunately there was one group of about students that constantly gnawed at my patience and by some stroke of bad luck i ended up being placed with some of them for one of my general education courses that i needed to graduate they appeared to come from very wealthy families as they were always decked out in designer labels each had of one of three models of mercedes benzs any other was uncool i dont know and did next to no work i was never included in their conversations and could barely string two sentences together in english this went on all term when they put my ass on the line by blatantly copying and pasting from a companys website for their class project due on the last day i had had enough i finished the project myself and saved both copies to a thumb drive with an explanation explaining why there were two projects to hand into the professor before sitting down for the exam also in the explanation i detailed every incorrect bubble i would fill out on my first scantron i proceeded to do so and watched as the lazy assholes around me copied mark for mark at the end i turned my test into the teacher and told her i wasnt finished yet just running to the toilets thinking i was done and leaving the students handed in their exams and left i came back filled out my scantron correctly and handed it in a few hours later i received an email thanking me for bringing their cheating to light from the professor that was the last i had any interaction with that situation but i can tell you that they werent back on campus the next term dont try to cheat off an international student that worked their ass of they dont appreciate it 
i live in a large older style apartment building we have these two neighbors that live above us that i swear wear cinder blocks for shoes as a heavy walker myself i do my best to ignore it though however that all changed when i would get the youre being too loud stomps on my ceiling during the afternoon or early evening i would be playing my acoustic guitar or something thats is nothing obnoxious the noise curfew is pm and we would be hours from it plus none of what i was doing would even justify a noise complaint no parties no stereo nothing like that so on top of this they are one of loudest units in the building loud music sporting events constant pounding yelling and what seems like furniture moving and falling over every day i couldnt let them get away with their ignorance anymore so since it is an old building all the units that stack on one another share water pipes i almost have their shower schedule down to a t so i mess with my shower nobs and randomly flush the toilet whenever theyre showering sometimes i can even hear them yelling and cursing about the fluxing water temperature while theyre in the shower puts a big smile on my face enjoy your bipolar showers jerks tldr upstairs neighbors pound on my ceiling i ruin all their showers

first post please be kind i hope this qualifies i work for ltbig satellite tv companygt doing residential installs for satellite tv several months ago i did an install at a duplex in a small town for a nice filipino lady now fl she told me how happy she was to be in canada and how her husband had worked for several years to bring her and their family young children into the country these things made me happy and eager to help her i proceed with my install problem on the side of the building there is already a dish mounted and the landlords will not permit me to mount an additional dish however i can use the existing dish as it is the same brand and there are free ports on it so i run my cable and hook up her receiver to the existing dish which belongs to her neighbor racist bugger who from here on shall be known as rb everything works out well and when i leave the whole family is crowded around the television changing the channels excitedly i leave with a smile on my face about minutes after i leave i get a phone call on my work cell fl crying someone cut our cable please come back and fix it me sure no problem shortened obviously i get back to her house and the brand new cable i had just ran is cut clean in the middle and is lying loose i ask fl if she had cut it and she had no idea what had happened so i decided to inquire with her neighbor me hello do you know anything about this cable rb why is that hooked up to my satellite that racial expletive cant do that rude words and angryness ensues me okay but explains situation there can be only one dish rb to bad she cant use mine more racial expletives but you get the drift me okay rb goes inside his house so i calmly walk over to the dish remove his cables and the entire assembly i then mount her dish in the exact same spot and cut his cables just to short to reach at this point rb comes out and starts raging at me to hook his tv back up so i calmly explain to him that i got permission from the landlord to supply fl with the service and as that is the only dish that they will allow he will have to ask fl if she will let him use her dish i smile and leave tldr racism isnt allowed in canada edit this received much more attention then i thought it would may just have to put a few more up but perhaps another story for another time edit formatting
as a child like many before me and countless more after i was told that i could grow up to be whatever i wanted to be you can imagine my surprise when i find myself standing in the rain at a bus stop at a school where i have been for seven years not feeling any more grown up or any closer to knowing what i wanted to be i go to a school with an offcampus parking lot since there are about nine million commuters and seven parking spaces on campus and considering the parking permits are much cheaper parking offcampus and riding the bus to one of the two stops on campus is an attractive option on the hour as classes end dozens of students will be waiting at the stop for a bus whose schedule is determined by a slightly challenged baboon rolling a sided die its really raining today its really the last day before thanksgiving break and everyone just really wants to get home however everyone is really wet because everyone really forgot their umbrellas everyone at the stop is huddled together under the covered portion i have an umbrella black rosewood handle inches my god it even has air vents when the bus arrives everyone turns into third graders really needing to take a piss bouncing up and down just waiting for everyone to get off the bus so they can rush the doors and get a seat out of the rain i quickly count about sixteen people waiting and a few still on the bus waiting for the next stop and knowing that there are about twentysix seats i knew i would be able to get one of them so i stand next to the door fully aware of the panic that could ensue and hold my umbrella over everyone in line people are smiling people are saying thanks crisis averted then she comes running down the sidewalk no umbrella no hood no foresight she locks her eyes on the door and picks up momentum surely you cant be serious she isnt going to stop she isnt stopping she is pushing everyone in line out of the way she is better than everyone else she really needs to get on the bus right now she is bitch nobody wants to deal with bitch everyone backs up a little and lets her get on the seats on the bus are arranged against each side so that the two long rows face each other bitch grabs one of the first seats i can see her through the window as the last student boards i carefully collapse my umbrella i walk up the stairs and make eye contact with her she was so proud that she finally took the advice of her horoscope and was more assertive today i see my seat in the back i walk by bitch and as i pass her i give my umbrella an ever so slight shake i cant make it obvious but i knew that she knew that it was me who flung all that water right in her bitch face i grew up a little holding my umbrella out for everyone perhaps i dont feel it because these little acts of immaturity that keep me sane are also what are preventing me from completely growing up or perhaps realizing the distinction is what growing up means i think again about the words i heard as a child whatever you want to be and smile i have become umbrella man
the office park that my office is situated in has pretty limited parking each office suite has a handful of spaces and theyre clearly labelled typically each office suite has a couple of spaces right outside the door and then another few spaces in the middle of the car park if you use all of your parking spaces you have to park half a mile away on the main road and walk back so it pays to get in early enough to grab a space theres enough space behind the spaces in front of the offices to park a car without blocking the car park if you park sideways behind two cars ie blocking two cars in but not stopping other cars driving around which is what the postman delivery drivers etc do some offices use this knowledge to provide an extra parking space as youre just blocking in your coworkers cars and they can easily get you to move if they need to get out my office is in the corner of the office park we have a space next to the wall and the space next to that the next couple of spaces are obviously allocated to the office next door i usually get in early enough to grab the space next to the wall now the office next door is the regional hq for a small company and they often have people from other offices visiting as theyre not familiar with the parking arrangements it isnt unusual for us to find that one of their visitors has taken one of our spaces in that case wed just knock on their office door and ask the owner of the car to come out and move it it happened so often that the landlord put a sign on the door of their office to remind visitors that they have to park in assigned parking spaces if were having visitors we make sure we leave a space for them as there are only a couple of visitors parking spaces for the whole office park and theyre always taken so one day i get in early and park in the corner space next to the wall lunchtime rolls around and i have to run some errands so i pick up some lunch while im out with the intention of eating it in the office i got back to work to find that someone from the office next door has taken my space while im out i recognised the car straight away it was one of their salesmen hes a real arsehole totally full of himself thinks the world revolves around him etc you know the type it isnt the first time or even the tenth time that hes taken one of our spaces either i dont want to have to drive right down the road and walk back and i can see him standing outside the office next door smoking and talking to someone i shout excuse me he ignores me i shout excuse me again still nothing i beep my car horn that gets his attention he turns round and i ask him if he can move his car he says in a minute points to his cigarette which by the look of it hed only just lit and turns back to his conversation i say excuse me again and get ignored again i beep my car horn again he turns to look at me i point out that theres assigned parking and i need to get back to work he shrugs tells me hell only be a minute and turns his back on me again obviously trying to reason with him isnt working and i wasnt going to sit around on the car park for another few minutes he could have moved his car out of my space and parked behind the two spaces allocated to the office that he was visiting but hed rather inconvenience me so i reversed my car right up to the wall blocking him and one of my coworkers in i got out of my car and he demanded that i get back in my car and wait as hed only be another few minutes i told him that i needed to get back to work and that he could knock on the door when he was ready and id come back out and move twenty minutes later glad i wasnt still in my car there was a knock on the door one of my coworkers answered it and came to tell me that i needed to move my car now usually id be straight out but as this person was a repeat offender had ignored me turned his back on me when i was asking him to move his car and had talked down to me when id parked i decided to make him wait i told me coworker to tell him that i was on a call and that id be out in a minute half an hour later i went out and moved my car to find him pacing backwards and forwards and complaining that hed missed a meeting on the other side of the city i told him that he should only park where hes allowed to park as per the sign on the door to the office that he was visiting that hed been told several times before and that he could have moved his car when id asked him to earlier he never parked in our spaces again 
sorry for any grammatical errors etc typed this on my tablet i work at a bakery and have to get up really early in the morning so i try to be asleep around or these kids have been giving my family trouble for a while so i already dislike them anywho it was a friday night and i was dozing off a little later than normal around ish then all of a sudden i hear screaming outside my window i keep it open because the fresh air relieves my asthma a bit and after minutes of hoping it will stop i get up to investigate i look outside and see about kids around years old running around the culdesac chasing each other all over the culdesac around my car in our garden destroying our flowers etc i dont care if they want to play outside at in the evening but why do they have to scream at the top of their lungs and run through the garden and destroy things i head downstairs out of anger because after closing the window i can still hear them loud and clear and get some water when i have an idea i grab my car keys and wait one of the kids decides to run behind my car and another tries to catch him and bangs into my car so i hit the panic button and watch them scatter this happens one more time and finally they shut up and go inside and i get to finally go to sleep it was so satisfying tldr kids were keeping me awake by screaming while they were running in the garden destroying things so i hit the panic button on my car to scare them off
i work at a hotel parttime to help pay my way through college im a desk clerk but because my bosses are cheap part of my job is also to put out breakfast in the morning now a lot of our guests are construction workers who like to show up minutes early for breakfast and get surly when its not already out at that time usually it is but sometimes i get busy with paperwork or other things and it gets put out right at am yesterday morning a guest kept me very busy so breakfast wasnt put out until am cue these construction workers waiting in the breakfast area talking about me in spanish saying the most horrific things where was that bitch at least shes cute things like that while i was hurrying to put breakfast out i didnt let on that i knew what they were saying and just put out the cereal fruit etc out as quickly as possible i could understand them being angry if they had to be at work at say but their work vans dont come to pick them up till after am this morning as revenge i made every single pot of coffee decaf call me a bitch because you had to wait minutes after i apologized profusely and explained the situation enjoy falling asleep on the job edit dont worry the construction workers are the only ones who eat that early so once they left i replaced the decaf with regular coffee

throwaway to not gross out my rl friends on my main account heres the backstory im a pregnant teenager i know i know ruing my life etc the baby will be going to a good home thats all taken care of im just trying to bring some good out of a terrible thing that happened i am prochoice and can understand criticisms of my actions but at this point im months pregnant and theres nothing you or anyone else can do to change whats happening my cousin doesnt feel that way according to her berating me for my life choices accomplishes something she also called me fat several times even though the doctor says i need to gain a little weight she knows ive struggled with eating disorders in the past as well and she knows the circumstances of the pregnancy that it wasnt my fault that it happened i have a permit but not a license yet and no car so when i had to drive minutes to the clinic for an ultrasound it was difficult to find a ride she volunteered which i was immediately suspicious about but figured maybe she wanted to apologize or make peace no first thing she said was gonna be able to get the seatbelt over that gut before patting me hard on the stomach i felt a little awkward maybe she was just trying to make a joke but she launched into it commenting on my weight how my body would never come back how shed heard about some adoptive parents running a sex ring wtf on and on i was getting upset but trying not to show it then i had an idea a symptom of pregnancy if you dont know is bad gas this is awfully embarrassing to write but i got it really bad all of my close friends fear me after a meal i asked her to stop off at a nearby taco bell she kinda rolled her eyes but complied i stuffed myself full of taco anticipating what would happen next but nothing we arrived at the clinic and i was terrified horrific forces were marshalling in my belly and i couldnt bear to unleash them on innocent medical staff i managed to hold it off during the visit but things were getting tense in the car ride home i was of two minds one wanted to hotbox her with taco fumes the other wanted to be diplomatic then she started in again god it was a massacre even with the windows open there was a fly in the car before i think it died it was unholy what happened in that car i feel like one of the designers of the atom bomb i am become flatulence destroyer of noses at a certain point windows down both gagging id never regretted anything more but they were still coming i didnt feel like a woman anymore but some kind of infernal gas machine you know those homemade tornado box science projects its like there was one of those in my butt swear to god i almost achieved liftoff on a couple by the time we got home she was effectively driving while intoxicated its like when cheech and chong get out of a van and potsmoke rolls out except for fart did i see grass withering before me i think so but that may have been a fartinduced hallucination i now understand the end to the revenge movies where the hero regrets it we havent spoken since i think she was in shock immediately after but now she knows my power but i wont use it again i cant control it im like the little girl in firestarter anyway thats that now all my relatives on her side think of me as an inhuman fart monster and i nearly committed a murdersuicide but i got revenge 
this is your average petty revenge story it was actually done to me by my yo daughter story my wife was away at some ridiculous tupperware party or some shit my daughter and i had a daddy and daughter night we were having a tea party with some of her dolls when she started misbehaving talking back and dropping her toys we teach her to respect her things and this is not allowed as a fitting punishment i ended our tea party she got upset and stomped off the the front hall and was out there for about min then came back with a grin on her face i just assumed she thought she had gotten away with some bigger punishment after that it was her bed time when i got back downstairs from putting her to bed i went to the front hall to grab my book out of my briefcase it was then that i realized what she had been doing in the hall she had found my book and removed the bookmark and just placed them beside each other edit werds
i went to a fairly large college where i had to dorm for my freshman year and we all know what happens when a bunch of kids many of who had not lived on their own before get together my dorm had but one laundry room for way too many kids with only like washers and dryers total im an incredibly anxious person so when id go do laundry usually around am i wouldnt bug anyone one day i decided to do laundry right in the middle of the day because of a canceled class i put all of my stuff in the washing machine and chilled out there until it was time to put my stuff in the dryer because weirdly enough dryers were harder to get after i put all of my clothes in the dryer i decided i was going to go take a nap but i set an alarm for minutes before my dryer was supposed to go off because i know how much i hated waiting whatever i come back downstairs after like a minute nap only to find this girl taking my stuff out even though i had a good amount of time left and my clothes were still pretty wet we locked eyes and she just shrugged not knowing they were my clothes did i confront her absolutely not i was a freshman she left and i waited until she got on the elevator and then stopped her dryer did i just stop it oh no i took all of her clothes out and threw them into the staircase down the hall so she could go looking for them when she came back i put my stuff in to finish drying and she never came back down so i lugged all of my stuff back to my room she never came looking for me so i guess she didnt know it was me tldr some bitch took my wet clothes out of a dryer that was rightfully mine and put hers in so i took hers out and threw them in the staircase
had to make a throwaway as my dad is pretty sensitive about anything to do with his joblife appearing on the dreaded interwebs my dad is a policeman and he works with a man lets call him bobby who by all accounts is a pretty stand up fella hardworking my dad hates the lazy and generally a pretty nice guy anyway his downfall came about years ago when he had an affair having been married for years i should mention at this point that they have no children suffice to say his wife was not over the moon about it you hear stories about scorned partners setting fire to their other halfs cars or scattering their clothes down the street but this as far as angry spouse revenge is something quite special bobbys wife found out about the affair because a friend of hers is married to a colleague of his news spreads etc instead of confronting him about it she thought long and hard about a way to really ruin his damn day bobby had an important work day coming upsome sort of meeting with his superiors with a potential for promotion but i cant remember the details bobbys wife carefully took a thread cutter to each item of clothing that he would be wearing that day and unpicked every other damn stitch no kidding from his suit down to his underwear you can imagine that the morning hustle and bustle commute was enough to perhaps strain some of the seams at most but as the day wore on his clothes started to slowly fall apart first a hole in the toe of his shoe she was obviously dedicated to the cause then his trousers started to fray upwards from the ankles the real kicker came when minutes into his very important business meeting the arm fell off his suit jacket the meeting was cut short and for reasons that may or may not be related i dont believe that he ever received the promotion he was after bobby and his wife and now happily divorced tldr bobby cheated on his wife of years and she passiveaggressived the fuck out of him 
i dorm and live with three people one in my room and one in a room attached via a kitchen and bathroom the girl in the other room lets call her cass didnt get assigned a roommate so her boyfriend basically started living with her a few weeks into the semester they do basic annoying couple stuff including leaving their condom wrappers around and being obnoxiously loud annoying but i can just ignore it the thing i cant ignore however is that he uses all of our stuff without replacing anything including hand soap dish soap and most importantly toilet paper this dude uses the bathroom like ten times a day yet cass refuses to compensate for the misdistribution of toilet paper usage so i get to the dorm after a weekend at home and find an empty toilet paper roll and two empty paper towel rolls on the bathroom floor just thrown there obnoxiously so i turn out of the bathroom and to my room to get some toilet paper while im getting it i hear one of them check the bathroom to see if i changed it so i grab a roll make sure they see it while i walk past them in the kitchen then decide to take like a halfanhour shower because i want them to have to wait as long as possible to use the bathroom then after making sure theyre not in the kitchen anymore i take my toilet paper roll with me once im in my room i hear one of them run into the bathroom again well you still dont have toilet paper so good luck petty i know but worth to me tldr my roommate and her boyfriend use so much toilet paper and will wait for me to come home to change it instead of replacing it i took advance of them having to use the bathroom by taking forever and leaving with my toilet paper 
about a year ago i was driving to school along a little winding road near my house when all of the sudden a woman in her young s pulls out from a side street no doubt not looking at the road between putting on her makeup and drinking her morning coffee she slams on her breaks and i speed up to get in front of her as i had no time to stop as she honks and screams now im driving down the road a bit ticked off and i see her in my rear view mirror shes tailgating me giving me the finger etc im already doing mph over the speed limit another mile of this and im super pissed now i know this road really well and i happen to know of a large pothole coming up let me describe the scene me in a jeep grand cherokee that eats boulders for breakfast speeding up to about in a zone toward a large pothole on this winding road meanwhile being followed by some bitch in her audi sportscar still tailgating i knew she couldnt see the pothole in front of me because she was following so close so instead of slowing down or swerving around i headed directly for it bam i hit the pothole no big deal just a little bump for the jeep i look in the rear view mirror and all of the sudden the womans windshield turns brown and she pulls over i was a bit confused for a second until i realized the pothole had caused her coffee to splash all over the windshield i felt bad but she totally deserved it
this happened a few days ago in the covered parking garage of one of my local grocery stores i had just filled my cart with the weekly shopping and was heading out to the car as the two doors swung open i immediately caught the wild driving of a woman in small silver car she had just weaved around a group of shoppers exiting the stores other front doors they were in the crosswalk and had been before the bitch got impatient i guess i should jump back i live in a state where pedestrians have the right of way every time and the general mood of drivers is to be considerate of those on foot what she did is illegal in my state and most cops would pull you over for a move like that so now the bitch is heading in my direction straight for my crosswalk knowing the situation i turn my face forward and proceed to walk i dont stop my cart slams into her car and groceries go everywhere she doesnt stop but i can see the huge dents in her car from ramming my cart a minute goes by i have a huge shit eating grin on my face and i hear this whiny nasaly shreik its the bitch coming after me i hold up my phone and ask her if shed like me to report the hitandrun on a pedestrian in the crosswalk or if shed rather take it as a lesson and fuck off needless to say she promptly put her tail between her legs and scurried off 
was just waiting to get into a parking lot which has a barrier where you have to get a ticket before you drive in there was a queue with roads merging into one although one road has a solid stop line and i was on the other road one person had been waiting a bit so i let them out from the side road and began to go forward when a second car pushed in front of me and didnt even say thankssorry i beeped and pointed to the stop line but the driver pretended not to understand they finally get to the barrier and somehow manage to take absolutely ages to push a button and take the ticket they finally pull into the car park and i take my ticket and see them in front of me stopped blocking the whole road with a space behind them obviously about to reverse into it i gave it a few seconds but their reverse light still wasnt on so i seize my petty opportunity and drive straight into the space get out of my car and start walking away an angry woman chased after me and tried to take my picture with her phone so i gave her a cheesy grin and two thumbs up 
this tale is from my grandfather who was in his early s in the s during the big gas crunch he was an uppermid level employee at a fuelservice station the way he tells it he wasnt management but just a veteran employee so a new guy gets hired well call him jason because ive never met a jason i liked who immediately claims to know how to do everything he tells grandpa on day one that he already knows how to do everything jason mostly ignores grandpas trainingorientation and claims to have a better faster or more efficient way to do everything after two weeks of being on the job jason offers to train the other guysguys who have been working there for yearsfor only a pay raise management declines his offer jason manages to piss everybody off right quick jason basically claimed to be a carsavant he claimed that his innate understanding of mechanics and the inner workings of cars allow him to maximize fuel efficiency jason claimed that he could improve his fuel efficiency as he drove his car a nova im guessing late s early s model by grandpas timeline he claimed the fuel efficiency would continue to improve as he did his own maintenance and tricks to the car in jasons mind the fuel crunch was bullshit democratic fearmongering and his fuel saving measures were proof of his intellectual superiority he figured he would be promoted to management soon and told my grandpa to stay in his good graces if he wants to keep his job after his promotion keep in mind jason is barely a month into a new job at a service station the revenge none of the employees liked him but he wasnt bad enough to get fired or to force him to quit jason was a dick but not dangerous or a liability the crew decided to humble him around the end of the first month everyone was sick of hearing about his shitty nova he would work on it in the service bays after hours and brag about his improvements i dont know how much involvement my grandfather had in this revenge but jasons downfall was orchestrated like a classic russian novelist tortures a protagonist the service crew started adding fuel to jasons car while he worked just a little it started a cup at a time then after the crew realized jason was too thick to notice they started adding pints and quarts sometimes a gallon before a weekend jason kept track of his mileage and fuelups in a note pad in his glovebox the crew kept track of how much fuel they added jason was going further and further on a tank every week after about months he was bragging to anyone who would listen that he was getting nearly mpg with his nova idk what size it was but wikipedia says the novas had engines between l and l in the s and s grandpa said at the peak they were adding a gallon of fuel a day to jasons car the crew decided it was time to pull the rug out they stopped adding fuel just long enough for jason to get about two tankswhere one low number couldnt be a fluke he couldnt figure out why his mpg plummeted he stopped bragging and started putting in extra hours after work trying to diagnose his car he changed his air intake his oil and filter jason was visibly agitated whenever crewmembers asked about his car jason about died when they began siphoning fuel grandpa said jason redoubled his efforts to find the problem he changed the oil twice in a week oiled wheel bearings and the crankcase bought new tires and changed fuel grades he even tried blending fuel grades he would leave cardboard under to the car to spot leaks he tried parking at different slopes to see if stuff leaked he checked seals and replaced them even if they were good even with all the stuff wrong with his car grandpa said the guy was still arrogant about his prowess under the hood the crew decided it was enough theyd just about recovered the fuel they had placed in jasons car and decided to stop siphoning at the end of the week jason gave them one last laugh though hed become a little bit paranoid about grandpas service station so he took it to some other service station and complained that his nova wasnt getting mpg anymore they laughed him out of the station the crew never confessed to their crime and jason was none the wiser jason was still a prick but he shut up about his car for the rest of the time he worked there
one of my friends is the type who will latch onto someone and demand to be the most important person in their life last year she did this to me and began to try and take up all of my time and would get unreasonably jealous over me having other friends or even wanting to spend time with my family i am admittedly not good at dealing with these types of people but thats a subject for another day and another subreddit so i probably encouraged this behavior when i added her to my netflix account out of pity for her not having her own however a month or so later shes absent mindedly complaining to me about how her husband has made a netflix account shes mad that hed want to go through the trouble of paying for their own account when they could just keep using mine for free i think after it came out of her mouth she realized how entitled and unsympathetic she sounded because she quickly changed the topic and never brought it up again obviously realizing that she has her own account now i changed my netflix password and deleted her profile from my account that part wasnt really my revenge though i was playing the long game see i know her husband doesnt make much money he makes enough in theory but she likes her splurges and she doesnt work at all by her choice and i figured it would only be a matter of time until they couldnt afford to pay their netflix bill due to her spending i could just hear her telling her husband not to worry about it because after all they still had my account to fall back on sure enough about six months later i get a message from her basically trying to play like the netflix password isnt working all of a sudden as though shed been using the account the whole time up until then and asking if i know what the password is of course i know its my account if she hadnt lied to me in that moment i wouldnt have done what i did next and there would be no petty revenge to tell but she did and thats when i told her yeah but sorry i have so many of my other friends on there i dont have room for any new profiles i just know that crushed her and dammit it felt good eta i added in a few extra details about their financial situation to make it clearer that they werent headed for the homeless shelter or anything like that

back in high school i had a librarian who was the most miserable bitch youd ever known of one rule was to print double sided and the cost was cents per page quite reasonable and i had no problems with that i was doing a physics project and had to print out an article which was pages with an image or two so after printing the article with the images i went to pay for my copy it was double sided so i thought it was cents i didnt know there was a surcharge on printing things with images which would cost me cents per page instead this was ridiculous and im sure she made that up on the spot i didnt have cents poor high school student so she ripped up my page and threw it out and told me bring money next time instead of wasting school supplies wtf she just ripped up the page and shes blaming me for wasting supplies the very next day i went back to the library planning my revenge on the computer i opened up ms paint and used the fill tool in full black set the printer to double print that and set it to print copies clicked print and left the library immediately i waited a minute before going back in to see the results of my revenge i see the printer spitting out double sided prints of black pages the librarian saw it and freaked the fuck out i see her frantically trying to cancel the print job and had to turn off the printer i bet there were at least copies of pure black pages heres the bonus she screams at everyone on the computers to stop what they were doing and she checks on each and every individual computer user i was watching from the side and it felt sweet no one saw what i did
thought this was perfect for this forum i was riding the bus last week with my friend rich the bus was packed with people who had been out doing christmas shopping so it was not only standingroomonly but also had everyones shopping bags and other crap piled up all around it was miserable and about degrees to boot we were standing in the aisle and seated next to us was a woman with her son who was about years old his mother kept yelling loudly at him about everything and he kept yelling back and jumping up and down on his seat which of course made him fall over onto people constantly as the bus moved he was being a total living terror and to make matters worse he kept pressing the button for next stop even though pretty much everyone on the bus was going to the end of the line the subway station so every time he pushed it the bus would have to stop at the next bus stop for no reason making this otherwise miserable trip even longer and more herkyjerky as the driver had to pull in to an empty bus stop open the doors and then deal with traffic we are in nyc the mother saw him doing it and gave him a huge spank on the ass and told him if he did it one more time he was going to get a whipping he would never forget my friend rich quietly reached up and hit the next stop button 
my sister and i mostly get along now being in college and living three states apart plays a large role but we absolutely hated each other while we were growing up she was selfish and irresponsible with a quick temper she would frequently borrow my possessions then hurl them at me in anger when i wanted them back she was careless with her own things and would often steal mine to replace what shed destroyed it wasnt uncommon for her to intentionally break something of mine when i made it clear that i wasnt going to cave in and give it up without a fight she was a nasty piece of work and was unfortunately encouraged albeit passively by our exhausted parents refusal to come to my aid when i was treated unfairly my sister had been a problem child since she was in diapers at home that is she knew better than to melt down in the presence of other people and they were just too worn out to care what she did to me unless i was left bloody or bruised id long before grown wise to her selfishness and thieving ways by the time i reached high school id established good hiding places in my room for some smaller valuable things and was shrewd about keeping these things from her sight and reach my clothes and shoes were always up for grabs though and shed even go through my underwear drawer and take what she wanted my cosmetics and toiletries werent really mine shed stopped hurling things for the most part as a teenager but still had her eyes peeled for anything she wanted for her own our birthdays are in the same month and our parents often bought us the same gifts when we were younger so that we wouldnt squabble over who had what but as i said she wouldnt take care of her things and would steal mine to replace what she had lost or broken living with her was horrible during my freshman year and her junior year she signed up to go on a weekend trip to the mountains with the youth group from our church i had no interest in it and couldnt see why she did the boys were okay but the girls were stuckup and id witnessed them ignoring my sister when she followed them like a lost puppy i imagined a trip with the group would be a lonely one for her our birthdays were a month or so before the trip and we had found favor with the birthday fairy we both received mastercard or visa gift cards from our childless aunt and uncle who have no other nieces or nephews to spend money on our parents let us pick out our gifts from them i chose an mp player to replace the one id had for years that now had a nonworking volume control my new toy was the same model but had twice the memory i set aside the old one to see if my dad could fix it and use it my sister chose some suede boots and gave me strict orders to stay away from them i remember feeling really angry about that considering all the things shed taken from me she took my moms advice and saved her gift card for the church trip after mom had dropped my sister off at church to get on a bus for the long drive she suggested that we go shopping with my gift card i wanted to but had some trouble finding it it wasnt in the drawer in my vanity where i knew id put it and i searched my room for several minutes before it hit me i knew i just knew i went straight to my sisters room and opened the tacky rhinestone box on her bookshelf it was her money box and my gift card was in it i knew it was mine because one of the groups of numbers was the last four digits of my friends phone number and another group was my birth year id noted this when i first received the card and looked at it my sister had stolen my gift card from my room and was probably going to pass it off as hers after using hers up my sister had done a lot of nasty things to me and had taken a lot from me not just my possessions but shed chipped away at my dignity over the years and left me without any selfconfidence but this insult stealing my birthday gift right out from under my nose is what i still consider to be the worst the icing on the crap cake was that i couldnt tell my parents theyd stopped listening to my complaints and pleas when my sisters everyday bad behavior became too much for them to stand it was easier to just ignore it when my mom and i went shopping i didnt bother getting anything that my sister could make use of i knew shed just take what she wanted shes taller than me and has an inseam at least three inches longer so i bought some jeans that i liked and knew would be too short for her i also treated myself to a couple of bras any bras that would fit me would overwhelm her wee attributes i love makeup but didnt bother going to the mall counters because my sister frequently raided my makeup bag and used my stuff even the germy things like mascara i wanted to get things that would be mine and only mine now heres where the sun comes out she was in a right snit when my parents and i picked her up at church the following week she was still flaming mad about opening her bag when she got to the hotel and finding that the shampoo shed packed my shampoo natch had a loose cap and had spilled all over her clothes and some other things she accused me of going into her bag and fiddling with the bottle so it would leak i didnt go into her bag but i did loosen the cap on all my hair care and body wash bottles before she left and then tighten them again after shed gone i knew shed take some of my stuff with her and i was getting the sticky results id wanted i denied it of course hotel staff had to take her clothes down to the laundry room and throw them in the washer this was mortifying to her she sobbed and screamed at me for what i had done then she regained her composure long enough to tell me that i wasnt nearly as clever as i thought i was ill never forget the selfsatisfied smirk on her face as she told me that she had used my gift card to buy tshirts and snacks for her friends and threw away my new shampoocoated mp player as soon as she took it from her bag mom confused piped up before i could with the news that i had used up every cent of my gift card at the mall and that id been using my new mp player all weekend my sister snapped back at her that it was my old player id been using and i took great delight in setting her straight she had a total meltdown when she realized shed cost herself a shopping spree and had not actually destroyed my property mom and dad for once were having none of it and shut her down pretty quickly when she tearfully demanded i hand over my mp player as a consolation prize she was still a jerk after that but was never as bad after the wind was knocked from her sails mom and dad started sticking up for me too justice edit im sorry about the overall length and the fatness of the paragraphs i hope its not a problem
we had terrible landlords once they started to struggle to pay their rental properties mortgages and started to pressure us to buy the house we were in at the time we loved the place and were willing to negotiate with them this was during around the time of the real estate market bubble popping so everybody was losing their shirt if they were selling at least in my area the landlords were out of touch with their asking price and were starting to use nasty techniques to pressure us suddenly they didnt remember our verbal agreement to allow our pets so we had to take our dog away from the kids and find her a new home when my husband lost his job and we pulled out of negotiations they tried to evict us they said they were losing the house and hoped if they could get a sale they could prevent it from happening if they could kick us out then they could sell it in their minds they didnt realize how long it can take to evict in december they returned our rent check to us unopened and sent a separate eviction notice regarding our dog we did our research and found out that we have a week to fix fixable problems we did that and sent a notice saying that she was gone we sent an obvious photocopy rendering their eviction attempt as moot then they tried to send a second eviction notice for nonpayment of rent we told them to bugger off so they took us to court my so attended and did all of the work for our lawyer and said that it was an awesome moment when the judge opened the stamped and sealed envelope with our rent check in it there was also a moment following that in which they brought up a copy of the rental agreement that was different from ours that had some handwritten amendments in it which we had conveniently broken my so had our copy on hand to show that everything they claimed had been forged we won in court it kept us from having to move on their time table to be petty they put a for sale sign in the front yard as per the original rental agreement it wasnt allowed so we made them remove it hopefully we put them in a bad position with their lack of ability to advertise plus we put a lien on the house we think theyre desperate to sell but they dont want us to get any of the money were still out on court costs

half term on a train into london and im lugging a large suitcase on public transport because apparently i hate myself as i go to sit down in this busy carriage i notice a seat block entirely occupied with a ltedit nice but temporarily inattentivegt mum and her three horrible children replete with pink disney rucksacks and piles of crisps all over the floor the kids girls aged about start jumping on the seats and yelling out of the windows obviously eager to leave the train the two older ones decide on a competition starting from arbitrary line on floor of carriage whichever of them that can disembark the train at the next and final stop wins unfortunately for me said arbitrary line is next to my seat and the kids immediately rush towards it pushing and shoving everything in their way including me for whole minutes i endure being poked and pushed while the kids yell at each other until a plan forms we start to pull into the station and i can feel the tension rising between the girls as the finish line is in sight just as the train comes to halt but seconds before the door opens i launch out of my seat in front of the girls and in one deft movement roll my case backwards over their precious line standing in such a way that i trap them into their seats the generous soul that i am i graciously allow every single other passenger to disembark the train before me luxuriating in the growing storm of whining and fidgeting behind me the smallest one begins to cry as i move agonisingly slowly towards the doors the girls trapped behind me i even stopped to get my oyster card out of my handbag and pointedly drop some of their own litter into the bin by the doors before leaving the train and its three crying redfaced little shits on the platform edit alright ye of foreign climes an oyster card is an electronic travel pass for public transport in london more edit for some reason i feel it is important that you read this in my accent which can only be described as akin to mary poppins replete with tightlipped smile this is one of the reasons i cannot reprimand people in public as the more awkward i feel the posher my accent gets
a few months ago i was driving home from my college campus when i reached the first way intersection outside of campus i had to wait a bit to turn left as there were a lot of cars coming from the other direction no problem i thought its pm obviously theres going to be some traffic as i waited the camry two cars behind me came out cut into the other side of the road and cut off an oncoming car to take the left turn i was pissed even more so because right when they cut me off i was about to turn i ended up right behind them slightly enraged but i tried to brush it off the street we were on was a busy one lots of people were parking on both sides people were crossing the street every which way all while the asshole in front of me was slightly swerving i ended up getting close enough to the car to see that the driver a girl in her s was texting while driving i was fuming at this point then i noticed the sign on top of her car she was a pizza delivery girl i recognized the logo on the sign and called the store where i spoke to a manager i was just calling to let you know that one of your drivers is driving erratically she cut me off from behind as i was waiting to turn left onto the boulevard then she was texting and driving for a while i just thought you should know because it reflects poorly on your company i could tell the manager was pissed he asked what the car looked like i told him it was a silver camry with a princess on board bumper sticker fuck i know exactly who youre talking about im sorry shes been spoken to about this on multiple occasions dont worry shes fired as soon as she walks through the door whats your address im going to send over a free pizza do i feel bad that she lost her job not at all it made the pizza taste that much better edit im a girl please stop referring to me as he in the comments edit for those of you who doubt my story id like to remind you that this was a small college town pizza place theyre not very formal with anything they do im pretty sure i saw a picture of the owner with whitey bulger hanging up on the wall last time i was there this also wasnt the first time i had called to complain about a driver the first time the driver kept my roommates phone number and repeated called and texted her for days afterwards they dont hire good drivers apparently they had also probably recognized my phone number in their system as i used to order from them often when i lived on campus giving a free pizza to an upset customer even if they werent ordering anything at the time saves face
my favorite way to finish while fucking my lovely wife is once she has had her fill of orgasms i like to flip her on her back on the edge of the bedcountercouchwashing machinerocking horse and cup her thick ass in my hands and thrust angrily until im ready to burst and pull out and let er fly oftentimes the result is a respectable shot across her breasts or an adequate belly button filler sometimes if i havent cum in a day or two ill land a couple drops on her face and neck needless to say my cumshots are quite variable depending on a lot of things arousal time since my last orgasm level of hydration etc a few weeks ago we were wrapping up a quickie in the shower and my wife starts begging me for my cum usually this is her polite way of letting me know that she has had her fun and i had better hurry the fuck up before the river runs dry still please cum on my face has a better ring to it than cant you cum or similar so im pretty thankful she has a good way about her besides if i am in the zone and im still a ways off begging me to cum on your face is akin to donning a top hat and waving a magic wand here i cum i pull out she kneels down in front of me and i cum sort of now in my defense i was terribly dehydrated from working hard all week and this was my rd orgasm of the day thanks palmala handerson about a half load dribbled out and landed on her cheek she grabbed my crank and rubbed the cum around on her face a little i could tell what she was thinking though wow she said that wasnt very much she had to needle me of course its just the way she is i guess i would do the same to hersorry i said not really feeling all that bad about it dehydrated i guess well dont let it happen again mr was her reply in a fake stern sounding voice we laughed and cuddled under the hot stream of water my playfully vindictive side however was plotting it wont happen again i thought because next time im going at you like a forest fire i didnt dare tip my hand though as i wanted the element of surprise so began my mission to drown my wife in cum i did research and found a few supplements that supposedly increased cum volume i masturbated constantly in the car the bathroom at work on fair rides not to completion though just enough to almost cum and then let up for a bit i spaced my orgasms out to every other day and then every third day i drank water all day long i mustve peed every minutes whenever we did fuck i made sure she didnt see my loads in her ass crack after doggy on her ass cheek during cowgirl for weeks i kept this routine going i was completely dedicated to my mission leave no sperm behind i noticed my spunk volume was up way up like triple what i normally produced and it was becoming a nuisance i had to switch from klenex to paper towels and then from paper towels to bath towels and then beach blankets i was like a ketchup dispenser at a busy fast food joint i decided it was time i let my trouser snake lay dormant for a few days knowing that would antagonize him into a frenzy finally we made love well actually its hard to call it making love when one of the parties involved is planning to secretly release a cum tidal wave on their lovers village she may have thought we were making love but i knew i was going to try and fuckwaterboard her it started innocently enough a simple shower as our kids watched busytown we loved throwing on a cartoon and sneaking away to the bathroom to fuck quietly but this time my intentions were secretly very sinister grab a couple extra towels i said youre going to need them i whispered but she didnt hear me we fondled as we adjusted to the steamy setting as we faced each other i picked up her leg and entered her slowly when she had time to adjust to my slow in and out i pressed her up against the wall and thrusted more aggressively my pounding was driving her crazy she loves getting fucked hard and fast but with us standing she can only get to the edge of her orgasm and she just plateaus over and over in agonizing fashion fucking sit down she grunted so i sat and she climbed on top of me and was bouncing up and down in quick succession fast and shallow slow and deep she alternates she knows how to satisfy her dark passenger and wastes no time soon enough she is thrashing and grunting and slipping all over the place she barely had time to come back down to reality before i had flipped her over with her hands on the floor and i was entering her from behind my hands grabbed and pulled her hips into my body faster and faster until she said the magic words cum cum on me cum on my face well allow me to retort it was like a crack of thunder followed by a monsoon stream after stream of hot cum flew out of me the first bundle was met with a shocked gasp her eyes blinked as if they couldnt believe what they were seeing the next shot was even bigger and she started laughing uncontrollably as she fell over backwards attempting to avoid enemy fire i was quicker though and was able to adjust strafing my flow in her direction pinning her into the corner of the shower stall when it was all said and done she was laughing so hard she couldnt catch her breath laying on the floor of the shower with her hands trying to fend off my charge and i was standing over her a la muhammed ali standing over sonny liston sorry i said sarcastically edit thanks for the feedback guysgals it

me and my so live in a shared rented house with others none of us smoke and the tenancy was listed as a nonsmoking tenancy with deductions from all our deposits if any one of us is found smoking this one housemate is a lazy dirty fuckhead he never cleans anything dishes or whathaveyou leaves stains on the toilet for weeks and regularly blocks the sink by trying to scrape half a plate of food down it it annoys all of us but any attempts at getting him to change fall on deaf ears a few months after he moved in we suspected he was smoking cigarettes in his room but since the smell wasnt really carrying through the house we werent too bothered then about a month ago he started smoking copious amounts of weed in his room the smell stunk out the entire house for reference he lives on the top floor at the front of the house and we live on the ground floor at the back and we could smell it strongly in our room with the door closed let it be known that i give no fucks about whether someone smokes weed or not its their body their choice but this is a specific nonsmoking house and we have a garden where he could have easily gone to smoke it is dickish to not only be a dirty lazy fucker who never cleans but also to inflict your habits on other people who rented this house specifically to not to have to deal with smoking again talking to him made no difference at all we were all getting really angry with it one day i went to work i work in education with children and adolescents my boss smelt fuckhead housemates cannabis on my clothes gave me a formal warning and said that if i smelt like it again shed have to take the matter further this is fair enough as it said in my employment contract that there is zerotolerance of staff using drugs trying to explain it wasnt my weed only dug me into a deeper hole i went home that day in a rage and vented at my so fuckhead housemate was out at the time me and so hatched a plan talking to him would clearly make no difference he gives no fucks if i lose my job so we decided to tell housemate that our landlady who rarely visits unless there is a problem had been around to inspect the house and had smelt his weed and was threatening us all with taking our deposits shes pulled a similar stunt before when the washing machine broke so we knew it would fly when fuckhead housemate came home me and so imparted this onto him we said that we covered for him and managed to buy time but if she smelt it next time wed all lose our deposits we also put in a bit of petty blackmail saying that if he didnt start doing his fair share of cleaning wed tell her it was him smoking needless to say he was really grateful for the headsup and ive never seen him move so fast nor clean so much the house was spotlessly clean by the end of the day and the smell was gone since then he smokes outside and the house is always clean a clear success methinks

so i work in a supermarket deli and we were having a busy day we were working hard trying to take and slice orders as fast as possible when this snobby lady walks up to the counter she feels like she shouldnt have to wait for her cheese like everyone else and demanded to be served immediately well immediately my superhero mode kicked in we decided to comply with her demands and the other customers were patient enough to understand i asked her what she would like with a deceptive smile on my face she asks for a pound of boars head american cheese cut thin ha the package might have said boars head she might have asked for it thin but later that day she will notice a negligibly devastating difference that is the taste of defeat the taste of being an entitled bitch at my deli that is the taste of the store brand american cheese cut in medium slices good day maam 
i work at a downtown firm and when our front desk receptionist goes to lunch our office assistance fills in for her here lately she has totally been disregarding our office assistance time and other work he might have to do for that day by coming in minutes after her lunch hour is up she always comes waltzing in like she has no worries so he was out a few days this past week so i filled in and sure enough she gives no fucks and comes in almost minutes late duly noted the next day im filling in again at exactly the end of her lunch hour i forward all calls up front to our bosses phone and leave the front desk so she comes waltzing in and makes it a point to tell our bosswhere is negronerd why arent you at the front desk i come to the conversation with the same exact question where have you been and that everyone only has one hour for lunch its now and youve just gotten here me sitting at the front is a favor to you not something for you to abuse so i got back to my job at pm i can clearly see the smirk and stifled laughter on my bosses face and i stand there like well miss lateness just walks away and goes and sits down the next day as my now returned coworker is sitting at the front for hershe comes back minutes early jackass 
so this is from a while ago but i think it fits here backstory i went to a private coeducational school for high school i had to wear a blazer outside of school and always had to look neat as part of the school rules our family also had a dog who was female and so she had a purple lead as chosen by my sister normally before i walk the dog after school i would change into some casual clothes maybe a hoodie and some shorts but today i didnt the incident so this particular day i was waiting to cross the road with the dog i had my full school uniform on and the purple lead in my hand then these two douchebags in a white van pull up at the traffic light and roll down their window im looking ahead minding my own business when i hear hey faggot now i didnt think it was directed at me so i didnt acknowledge them it wasnt until they started whistling at me and calling out hey you blazer boy that i turned around i looked over and one of them was leaning out the window shaking an open fist near his mouth like he was sucking a dick now im not gay nor have i ever been gay so this made no sense and i had never seen these guys before so they had no reason to do this as this guy finished doing his blowjob impression with his friend in the driver seat laughing hysterically he said words which just angered me so much you gay shit kill yourself the revenge the crossing light went green at this point and i began walking away from them they followed slowly alongside me called me names and honked their horn whenever i didnt look at them i continued ignoring them for three blocks before i stopped looked at them pulled out my phone and said the number for the police out loud as a dialed it in the look on their face was priceless as they realised what was happening they sped off down the street and through a red light a camera flash went off as they went through there was one ticket coming their way i had memorized their number plate and told it to the police who apparently found them doing kmh in a school zone which in australia is normally kmh and charged them not only for verbal abuse but also for speeding that coupled with the red light ticket and previous speeding fines meant that the driver was out of demerit points and lost his license tldr two douchebags call me gay for no reason verbally abuse me and tell me to kill myself they get fined over and lose their license
i wont lie me and my buddies love some christmas cheer we all work really hard so when we decided it was time to party we pooled our money together and figured it was time to go all out we went to our local walmart and grabbed quite a bit of booze we waited in a check out line for minutes normally thats not shit but then the following happened some big haired woman decided to treat us like we were a bunch of a worthless garbage this woman decided she could cut in front of us and scoff at us when we called her out so when we she took our spot in line we waited until she rang up all her shit and then we waited until she paid one of my boys slid a couple of cases on the bottom of her cart we all had a laugh as she rolled her fatty ass cart to the door it was then that my buddy hollered hey that lady didnt pay for those cases i swear it was like a movie since it was the holidays and all two motherfuckers working the door stopped this big haired lady grabbed her receipt and started questioning her on everything we didnt stick around but ill be damned she deserved everything she got 
during my last couple of years of college and the first year or so of my adult real job life i lived in a house with two roommates basically one guy boughtowned the house me and the other guy paid rent one roommate the other renter was an inconsiderate slob who managed to attract an equally inconsiderate girlfriend she was rude bitchy loud obnoxious and worst of all over all the time she stayed overnight at least nights per week most of which fell on weekdays now the house we lived had one bathroom which wasnt a big deal since those of us who lived there were all on relatively different schedules until she moved in rent free at the time my job was roughly minutes to an hour away from the house she worked roughly minutes further away than me but almost the same commute which was a less than fun multiple expressway route of mass congestion her job is also a so the first time she stayed over i wake up at my normal time and she is in the bathroom taking her sweet time getting ready for work she got up maybe minutes before me i knock politely ask how long she will be i need to get ready to go to work etc im eventually allowed access to my bathroom its mine i pay rent dammit i rush and get ready for work this repeats every morning shes over for weeks despite explaining to her that i get up at xx time to get ready for work shes free to use it to get ready but shell have to work around my schedule apparently that doesnt matter i go so far as to tell the boyfriend roommate that his girlfriend needs to get ready at her own place or wake up earlier no change on to the revenge i start setting my alarm minutes earlier just enough time to beat her to the bathroom but also some precious minutes to grab a few other thingsmy clothes a book breakfast i do every part of my morning routine behind the locked doors of the bathroom shed knock on the door from time to time and id just respond almost done i stayed in there until it was absolutely time for me to leave for work and on my way out of the bathroom i smiled and waved and told her to have a great day i continued on like this until she finally got the hint and started staying weekdays at her own place or when she did stay over she was waking up in time to leave to go to her home to get readymy understanding is that it wasnt that far away anyway

was at the grocery market yesterday in the line next to me was a mom and her whiny son he was crying because she wouldnt get him candy this went on and on and was annoying she finally caved as annoying as the whining was i was more annoyed at the fact that she caved in so we had to listen to all of that for no reason so we were leaving nearly simultaneously the kid was running toward the doors but i got there first i walked across both sets of automatic doors so the little shit didnt get to open them
this happened about a month ago the neighbor kids were having a party down the road which was a common occurrence they are th graders so they dont know how to people yet i arrive at my moms house coming from a visit from my university which is about an hour away the kids notice this and start walking up my street which is a culdesac they approach me and my new car they start making snide comments about how i have such a nice car and how it would be so terrible to see something happen to it i shrug it off tell them to go back home and go inside the reason for my visit is because she hasnt been feeling well so after coming inside i quickly go back outside to run to the store and lo and behold the kids are laying down in my lawn they immediately run as soon as they hear the door now i had been annoyed because of the los angeles traffic which i had been stuck in so this was the last straw i go back inside wait for minutes and then silently sneak out the back door with a leash for my lb great dane roxy now roxy wouldnt ever hurt a soul but she loves to run i walk through the side gate with her and peer over the gate there they are this is glorious i let more of them accumulate and i burst through the gate with roxy right by my side the look on their faces was absolutely priceless we chase them down to the end of the street which is only about yards i walk roxy home and then return to the kids house and ask for a parent i explain the situation which they are disgusted with they call the other childrens parents and they all go home all in all it was a fun night tldr th graders be trippin in my yard big dog be scary mom gets soup edit is roxy shes laying down and stretching this was the only photo my mom had of her on her phone ill take another when i go home tonight edit is the picture i took of roxy tonight edit is her with a gallon of milk for scale i didnt have any bananas
my mother is a little strange when it comes to car care she thinks falsely i checked the manual to be sure that her car can only have midgrade gas because regular gas isnt good enough and ruins the car she also thinks that using the parking brake is bad for the car and that it should only be used in emergencies i live with my mother to save money on rent im a senior in college though so im largely independent my parents are divorced but they live a mile from each other my mother is visiting family out of town so i cant go with her because i have to be back for work my family on my dads side is visiting him however so i said id spend thanksgiving with them out of convenience my mother didnt like this however and said i couldnt use her car to visit them she has two cars one for her use and one for my siblings and i to use since theres three of us and we all drive she finally gave in saying i could use the car but only if i filled it up with gas so guess what i did thats right i bought regular gas and to add insult to injury i used the parking brake twice take that mom 
i did some freelance scripting for a toplist voting site owner hasnt responded to textsemails asking for payment wasnt even that much money so this morning i changed the ftp password and added a few lines of 
im a white american guy and my girlfriend at the time that this happened was a recent immigrant to the united states from central america she and i were attending a spanish language church nearby so she could meet more people with similar backgrounds and not feel lonely in her new country we also started attending a spanishlanguage small group bible study a few blocks down the street from where i lived at the time which was made up of other members of the same church also attending the bible study was a very nice family consisting of a husband wife and three sons the oldest son was about years old the second time we attended the bible study together this kid made a point of coming up to my girlfriend three different times in a few minutes to give her a kiss on the cheek to say goodbye this is common in latin culture of course but i also was not ignorant of what was going on hes a hormonal teenager who took a liking to my girlfriend and used the goodbye excuse to make his move i watched him thread his way through the whole crowd multiple times to get close to her and oddly enough didnt feel the need to give any goodbye kisses to the lessattractive women attending the bible study whats worse is that my girlfriend was clearly digging this attention as our relationship went on in the future i began to suspect that she might have a thing for teenage boys despite being twice their age if she ever gets a job as a schoolteacher shell probably make the news one day for getting caught in a broom closet with a high school senior or something so after watching this little public display of affection and seeing her basking in the glow of some teenage attention afterwards i hatched my plot the following sunday we attended the morning service and sat in our usual spot which was coincidentally right beside this kid and his parents his friends including several cute girls around his age always sat right behind them so we were surrounded by his friends and family at this point i allowed my girlfriend to move into the row first so she would sit beside him just as i suspected he made his move leaning in to kiss her on the cheek and say hello which set her to blushing then i struck i leaned around behind her to give him a firm mantoman handshake as soon as i got hold of his hand i pulled him towards me and leaned in as if i was going to give him a kiss on the cheek as well just another ignorant gringo trying and failing to assimilate into latin culture he recoiled immediately before i made any skin to skin contact and jerked his hand away from mine all of the girls and boys sitting behind us started giggling and whispering since they had seen it all he was so embarrassed that he leaned forward in his seat and put his head between his knees his mother was sitting beside him and tried to comfort him by rubbing his back and neck he threw a minor tantrum and shrugged her hand away which set the girls to laughing even more my girlfriend stared daggers at me for embarrassing her new boy toy and i got all wideeyed and asked what just happened since apparently we were all in a kissing mood that morning and i was just joining in we kept going to church and the bible study after that and the kid never crossed me again mission accomplished 
backstory so i work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into manhattan i live very close to a njny train that takes you into the city in a timely manner its a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded quickly so if youre lucky enough to get a seat youll enjoy your ride into the city in comfort the epicenter of the train is in jersey city this stop could be considered the grand central of this small train line this is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city this is your chance to get the coveted seat now as a young healthy female i dont mind whether i get a seat or not it definitely is nice to have one just so i dont feel like a sardine but i am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly manwoman the story the platform was empty since a train to the city just left they come every minutes so i stood before the yellow line and patiently waited people began filling up the spaces around me nothing new people stand next to me behind me etcetc but since i am standing right behind the yellow line no one goes in front of me since theyd probably fall onto the tracks some girl lets call her pb for pushy bitch my age clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me im sure pb angered those several people but i didnt hear anyone complain pb hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her left anyway the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform because everyone wants a seat on the train you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit i always hold my ground because i dont want to end up as rail pancake the train is getting closer and i feel a palm on my back give me a little shove thankfully i had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didnt affect my time or ability to catch myself i turn around and its pb still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else i knew it was her also if it were even possible at this point she moved closer to me i feel her breathing down my neck the train pulls up and the doors are directly in front of me but they arent open yet it takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doors pb gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as i can now to the train of course i am as close as i possibly could be but she wasnt satisfied shes off the phone now another bag hit im pretty ticked off by now and it was like this petty revenge was meant to be so i decided to look back towards pb and look on the ground around her i did it a couple of times i finally decided to say hey did you drop that and i pointed to the ground near her at that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train she was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought i was talking about all the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered she looked both ways for any empty seat but poor pb wasnt fast enough she had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots oh well pb dont be a pushy bitch tldr girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train pulled the old did you drop that on her making her miss her chance to get a seat edit words

so a while back i had recently moved and desperately needed a job found some temporary work at a steel mill the work was easy but menial the pay was good but the coworkers were very cliquey obviously i was sort of alien because i was a geek working on my computer science major while almost everyone else were these big burly types you wouldnt want to mess with the couple of people at my work station seemed friendly enough not too bright but im not one to judge a few months go by and i notice them exchanging glances at some of the nerdy things id say im kind of a dork ill admit it im eating my lunch and overhear them joking around about me and talking trash as the days go by i hear more and more and i realize they basically only talk to me so they can trash talk and laugh about it later so i begin plotting and finally settle on something simple yet devious they both say pretty cringeworthy things on a regular basis for example coworker comes up and says i just came up with this funny joke i dont masturbate because its easy i masturbate because it is hard and then he erupted with laughter while me and these other two just stood there awkwardly silent so i take all the stupid things coworker says and told it to coworker as if i was the one saying it and then did the same thing with coworker i hear them later talking shit about the various things i said fucking win i just set them up and they are now trash talking each other to each others faces i walked out of the building laughing my ass off petty revenge at its finest i continued doing it until i quit for a better job idk if they ever caught on tldr i tricked two asshole gossipy coworkers into shit talking each other edited for clarity and typos
this was recently told to me by my parents so a few years before i was born the early s my parents were moving some heavy items up to their new apartment in queens and they hired a moving company to do it now my parents are immigrants but theyre not stupid my dad came here in and had been around the block a few times so to speak having dealt with moving companies before he found one that would offer him a flat rate ie he would pay a certain amount no matter how long the job took he negotiated this with the company office before the job and they signed a contract to that extent well the big day comes and there are many heavy items that need to be lifted fridge sofa bookcase etc but nothing that should take more than minutes tops the movers who show up begin to work as my mom and dad do other work around the house after an hour my mom notices that only two things have been moved up and goes over to the window to look outside and see whats happening she sees the movers putting on a big show of trying to lift a sofa according to her it was four burly guys faking very very hard and she realized that they were trying to increase the time of the job so that they could get paid more she calls my dad over and tells her to go yell at them because they were getting paid a flat rate anyway now my dad is a very honest and calm guy but he gets pretty deviouspissed as hell if someone tries to cheat him i have another story about the time he went ballistic on a ford dealer but thats for another day he begins to head down the stairs but stops himself and smiles he tells my mother that they should let the men carry on the movers continue their theatrics for the next four hours until finally the last item is up the main mover then calls for my dad and hands him a bill which has been calculated due to hours worked my dad looks at the bill and mentions hell be back with the money a few minutes later he hands the lead mover a check for the original flat rate he had negotiated the guy becomes agitated and demands the rest of the money my dad calmly takes a copy of the contract out and shows the lead guy that the payment had been decided by his boss well before the job the mover turned bright red at realizing that he had essentially wasted his own time and took my dads check before walking out of the apartment my dad then promptly called the moving company and chewed them out for whatever underhanded tactics they were trying to pull tldr parents hire a moving company and dad makes sure the job will be a flat rate scumbag movers try to bill my parents for an hourly job and waste their own time by doing so 
i manage itis for a medium sized company we had a new employee hired around weeks ago a few days after she started she came over to my desk and started complaininglecturing me about some minor issue that has literally nothing to do with my job after she finished her rant she said something like so i need you guys as if i was a subordinate of hers to make sure this doesnt happen again you need to be more careful about this in the future and so on i say hold on just relax what are you even complaining about why are you upset with me about this i hope you realize that your little issue has absolutely nothing to do with me or my duties here next time please make sure that before you start talking down to someone you barely know you are at least confident that it is the right person now what can i do for you she gets all flustured and huffy says nevermind and storms off fast forward to the other day and she approaches me with an actual issue related to my job her company issued cell phone was not working turns out her sim card has died her phone is a year old blackberry which is unfortunately standard practice at my company to reuse and distribute to new employees i am in the process of moving all employees over to a new service provider which also involves handset upgrades of course if this was an issue for any other employee i would have ported the phone number over to the new provider and upgraded to brand new device but since i am still a little salty about her attitude towards me on that fateful day i have decided to simply get a new sim card for her blackberry she will eventually get upgraded when we get everyone switched over but now she will have to wait for an extra couple months before we implement that plan if she had been more respectful she could have a brand new galaxy s or something in her hand right now tldr new employee was rude to me cell phone breaks instead of giving her a brand new galaxy s i give her a new sim card for her year old blackberry

background so i grew up in a typical toxic based family parents were too afraid to divorce for fear of community gossip i guess this is just my guess i will never hear the truth from them but its not a big deal to me anymore dad was fairly physically abusive when me and my older brother were younger and extremely emotionally abusive to the whole family one thing he did was constantly complain about how much of a financial burden we are which is extremely relevant to the story what happened so im and recently got a job in it and its the first time i got a job that will give me enough financial stability to finally never need my parents money again its been my life goal for that to happen so i never tell my dad anything about my life he will call or text every so often and i purposely make it like pulling teeth ever since i was about or so he started trying to be my friend which to me was even worse than emotionally abusive dad because at least emotionally abusive would yell at me and try to teach me how to be a successful personalthough in an extremely wrong of way doing it so anywho either my brother or momi dont particularly like either of them ive always felt they cared more about themselves which is fine but they constantly give me shit for being selfish like one time i refused to give my brother a ride to the towyard because a couple months earlier i gave him a ride and earlier that day i gave him a ride to work and both my mom and brother called me a selfish lazy asshole so my dad texted me congratulations about getting the new job he then proceeded to work the conversation in to how he was proud of me and how i can finally pay him back for food rent private schools etc i shit you not but he said he would be fine with thousand paid out over the course of a year as a symbolic gesture of thankfulness because and i shit you not again he said it isnt even a tenth of what i owe but it would be enough to make him happy to which i replied you know what you are right and that seems completely reasonable there is no way i can ever repay you in full but thousand seems like a good amount to show my thankfulness but you are forgetting one thing pause and wait for dads reply my dad replied after about ten minutes and what is that i am forgetting to which i said you are forgetting about the terrible dad tax which coincidentally comes out to thousand dollars its been a day and still no reply it felt insanely good saying that and yet insanely scary because this means i totally cut myself off in case of emergencies which i should mention i have a chronic disease which requires a ton of money on top of the insurance so i hope to god my companys medical insurance is top notch also it wasnt like my dad would give me the money when i ask its more like i ask my mom who then lies to my dad but this text upset my mom who said i dont know what im talking about whatever i think im finally free from my family thanks for reading my novel edit if you dont have anything nice to say then its already probably been somewhere deep down in the comments so please stop commenting with your opinions it sends me a message everytime you comment so i probably will read it so just keep that in mind
a bit of background for this story i work at one of the largest trucking companies in the us as a local driver out of phoenix i drive a daycab and am home every night once every few weeks my company asks me to come all the way across to california about miles since i cant legally make it there and back in one shift they offer to pay for my hotel for me on the california side and i drive back to phoenix the next day yesterday happened to be one of those times i didnt make it all the way to my destination though there was a problem with some wiring in the trailer i was pulling and the lights werent working properly meaning i had to stop about miles short of where i needed to be no biggie ill just make it up today and pull a long miles that was my thought anyway i get to my destination terminal in the early afternoon with my next load all ready to go go inside get the paperwork and try to find the trailer i find it but theres a problem another daycab driver parked his truck in such a way that it blocks the trailer im supposed to get to i dont mean that i have to try to snake it in noi mean he just decided to park his truck randomly in front of a bunch of trailers instead of the area hes supposed to said fuck it locked up his truck and went home for the night what follows is a three hour ordeal that involves me trying to find a different load with dispatch there are none going to the shop on the other side of the yard to get a key made it doesnt work going back to get a second key made this one doesnt work either getting the shop foreman to come out and use his master key to unlock the truck then wait for him to finally cut a key for the ignition im supposed to be halfway home by now and i am livid foreman gives me the new key to the offending truck so i can move it the trucks we are assigned are ours we dont swap out so whoever parked the truck sideways the night before will end up using it again when heshe comes in the truck is completely trashed trash stains cigarette butts everywhere etc now i could have thought i can move this truck feet and then i can get my trailer what i actually thought was fuck this guy instead of driving feet i took the truck over half a mile clear to the other end of the yard and buried it among about a hundred other trucks i may or may not have accidentally hit the powercord to the tracking unit with my foot on my way out of the truck thereby making it impossible to look up by gps position in a yard the size of a rural airport as the title says i hope he enjoys the hike update i got a call from the dispatcher at that yard he asked me in a low voice seriously where did you park the truck when i asked why he told me the driver got there at and had been looking for the truck since then it was noon when i got this call dispatcher thought it was hilarious because he doesnt like the guy and told me that he was so angry he was spitting and threatening to kill whoever moved his truck after the first hour and a half of searching i relented and told the dispatcher where the truck was he looked up the last location in the computer and passed the location on made my fucking day
he controlled every aspect of our lives but he was especially bad about the tv he always had to have his chair and always had the remote no matter what not even my mom was allowed to use the chair or the remote when he wanted them the whole rest of the family could have been minutes from the end of a movie and hed still change the channel on us everyone also had to be completely silent when he was watching something especially judge judy or cops if he could hear us make any noise at all he would go ballistic when i was about i got mission impossible for the gameboy color it was a terrible game but had one really neat feature you could point any remote at the gameboys infrared port and it would record the signals generated by the remote and then map them to the gameboys buttons this effectively made the gameboy a universal remote i was never without my gameboy in those days and i would often lie on the living room floor and play it on silent while my family watched tv once a month or so i put in mission impossible and just went nuts watching him go berserk with no one to aim it at was one of the most satisfying experiences of my childhood i was never caught

a bit of backstory my bil lives with us it originally started as a convenience arrangement my husband and i had a baby and we had a hard time making ends meet between diapers and formula and whatnot bil was an over the road truck driver and only home every other weekend at most usually every third weekend he needed a placed to crash those weekends and we needed help with the bills seemed perfect and at first it was then bil got fired he quickly found another job but it wasnt paying nearly as much as driving had and suddenly his financial help steeply dropped off as in stopped and on top of that he was home every single night hes loud hes obnoxious and hes a disgusting excuse for a human he doesnt brush his teeth he rarely showers and i wont even set foot in his bathroom its so disgusting hes also a big dude huge and he eats a lot example we once had a chicken fry its a southern thing you have everyone over and you fry up a ton of chicken and hang out and have fun there was a good deal of chicken left over so i spent about four hours cleaning and deboning it and made about lbs of chicken salad i was proud it was enough to make sandwiches for all three of us for the rest of the week until i woke up the next morning and the empty bowl was sitting in the sink and when i asked him what happened to it he said oh yeah it was really good thanks i saw red since hes been living with us hes obviously been eating meals with us ive noticed that when i make meals that he eats i have to make enough for myself my husband my son and then four additional adult portions to feed him when i approached him about how much he eats his response was have you seen me it takes a lot to feed me fatass you wouldnt be that big if you ate less the last time he bought groceries was six weeks ago he doesnt pay rent and the only bill he handles is the cell phone bill i finally got fed up and my husband refused to say anything to his brother so i took matters into my own very petty hands the past week ive been cooking dinner like normal but ive been progressively making things he likes less and less monday it was chicken enchilladas tuesday it was steamed vegetable casserole wednesday it was pasta with mushroom sauce and last night was the best he has long had a horrid aversion to fish i made sure i prepared the fish and put it in the oven about ten minutes before he got home by the time he walked in the door the whole house smelled like cooking fish he glared at me then ran back out the door to retch then when he came back inside he ran upstairs as quickly as possible i got a text later that said are you making anything besides fish you know i dont like fish i responded with fish is good for you but if you dont like it heres directions to the grocery store i havent heard from him since tldr bil is a lazy fat bastard who eats all our food and rarely puts in to the expenses i started a campaign of making food he hates so far so good 
back in the th grade i had a bully who would steal my homework and copy my work everyday and pass it off as his own now he wasnt the smartest guy and he damn sure wasnt the most clever but every morning before we left the bus to go to school he would isolate me and force me to let him copy my work the end of the year exams were coming up and on my best subject algebra our seating plans had him next to me his ugly smile and narrowed eyes made it evident he was planning on cheating and i had enough of his bullshit on each of my questions i intentionally chose the wrong answer and he watched intently as he followed my pencil after minutes and being done with the multiple choice i moved onto the written questions and sure enough his dumb ass began to copy me this is where i started to fuck with him the most i answered each question incorrectly but with the correct work on the side of each question i would write a set of numbers by the end of the final question i had created a cipher and my petty revenge had come to fruition im sure some of you have probably heard of the number to letter cipher where you substitute letters for numbers based on their place in the alphabet the numbers i wrote next to each written question were we were all the way in the back with me sitting in the corner after the test was over i went to the administrator and handed him my test along with my scrap paper which held the cipher key telling him to look at them a week later i was allowed to retake my exam because of the circumstances now im a freshman in highschool and i havent seen his ugly mug since tldr my th grade bully was seated next to me during final exams he copied me i used false answers made a letter to number cipher and made him flunk edit oh my flying spaghetti monster this is so unexpected thank you guys for the upvotes edit fixed are to our thanks ujerm edit

this happened a few years ago but thought it was appropriate for here i cycle to work and back most days as i work in a big city the roads are busy with traffic one day as i was cycling home minding my own business a white van drove past me and as it did the passenger leaned out of the window and shouted at me in order to scare me and he succeeded in fact i nearly fell off my bike the van then carried on down the road whilst i took a minute to compose myself i knew the stretch of road we were on very well as i cycled it every day so i knew that usually the traffic started to queue a bit further down the road i instantly knew how i was going to get revenge and started to speed up as i got further down the road i could see the van in question in a queue waiting for a red light i carried on cycling faster until i was almost level with him i could see that the passenger side window was still rolled down so i slowed down almost to a stop took a deep breath and shouted rrraaaaaaaarrrgghh as loud as i possibly could into the van until that day id never seen someone jump into the air with fear before but both the passenger and the driver jumped up off their seats i carried on down the road but took a look over my shoulder a few moments later and i could see that they both recognised me as the guy they scared a few moments ago and both gave me a thumbs up as if to say touch 
the neighbors are arrogant dicks and have a bratty kid thats always acting up throwing tantrums being abusive towards others and animals etc between their dog crapping in my yard and their kids thinking my backyard is a playground theres a little silent frustration there i pick up a disney gift card at the store and put it in a mickey mouse birthday card with a note that says hope you have fun at disneyworld the first week of january love mom and dad i also picked up another card wishing him a happy birthday that i signed myself but in a different envelope stop by their house the day of his birthday party and dropped off both cards didnt stick around for the aftermath but from inside my house i could still hear some pretty loud screaming and things being thrown kind of wish i had stuck around to see it all go down i heard the next day that when jr found out he wasnt really going to disneyworld he started throwing his presents and broke half of his toys
walking home and see a car blocking the drive of a shopping center people are mad because the lady wont move up to let people into traffic i yell at her as i walk by that people are trying to get out and she is blocking them she says she doesnt care she takes the next turn and stops at the gate of my apartment complex i realize she is a neighbor i get to the gate and she is furiously tapping her gate remote it appears the batteries are dead in her mirror she sees a figure walking up to the keyoperated control not realizing i am the same person that just yelled at her she asks if i can open the gate for her i say no i dont care i jump the gate and walk in leaving her to stew 
so i live in a unit apparent building in a large metropolitan city with a landlord that used to be a lot better than she is currently her relationship with the buildings occupants has gone down the tubes since she decided she didnt like being a landlord anymore and stopped giving a shit about fixing things on time not to mention opening the place up to air bampb bimbos who get drunk lose their key and ring every doorbell in the building at am until someone gets up to let them in my roommate and i have been living here for a couple years and are sticking it out for now but weve become prone to a lot more petty behavior than we have in the past the latest incident was an enormous crt television that someone left in the down stairs hallway near the front door its the biggest crt ive ever seen and takes up nearly half the width of the hallway i would have loved to have had it when i was but now its just a giant burden there were a few people that moved out recently and some shuffling around so i figured it was temporary cut to a month later and its still happily taking up space in the hallway irritating me more every time i have to look at it my roommate wanted to just chuck it to the curb were it would likely incur the building and my landlord with a pricey fine as bulky garbage pickup was only allowed on certain days of the week but i stopped him tempting as it was and figured that writing an email first was the adult thing to do at least give the landlord the chance to do handle this she had gotten fines before because of the carelessness of other tenants with their garbage and i wanted to attempt to do the right thing so i email the landlord ccing everyone in the building without accusing anyone asking for her to help address the problem within minutes she emails me and me alone back saying just put it outside welp ok i guess she doesnt care about the fine my roommate and i are moving it within minutes only thing is that it weighs a ton no wonder someone didnt want to bring it with them really awkward to get outside but we did planted it right in front of our building ready for the garbage men to see in the morning and give out the fine the revenge comes later that night around pm my roommate came back from the store and told me that someone had moved the enormous tv down the street in front of another building so this was my landlords plan just push it over to another house to deal with so she wouldnt get the fine well that landlord isnt getting out of this that easy tv was just as heavy and awkward as ever but my roommate and i hauled this thing right back down the block to our building we even wrote the building number on the tv incase someone tried to move it again edit as of this afternoon the tv is gone from in front of my building not sure the garbage truck or someone else picked it up or if it was just moved even further away either way i probably wont know if my landlord got the fine or not unless she tries to blame me which i doubt she will because it would involve her basically admitting to moving the tv away from the building i half want her to though just for the satisfaction

in i was living with the most moneyconscious person i have ever met well call him pennypincher it wasnt his most annoying trait that title was held by his screaming graphic profanities via mic at randoms playing call of duty at am or maybe leaving his kids dirty nappies on worktops in the kitchen but it was the trait that cost me the most a few examples all of the bills were in my name when he moved in he asked to see copies of the bills so he could determine his exact share i was fine with this i wouldnt expect anyone to blindly trust someone they didnt really know so id prepared all the documents in advance in case he asked i showed them to him some bills were paperless so i showed him my online accounts too sorted right nope every month and sometimes every week hed query a bill or ask why internet was so expensive and have me call the company to see if a better rate was available or ask to see another bill again and get angry when i said i hadnt kept them i started sending him a monthly breakdown to try and mitigate this but he kept at it anyway after a month or so pennypincher suggested that because he uses less electricity than i do he should pay less of a share of the gaselectric bill i asked how he was able to determine how much electricity i was using and he said id left the bathroom light on all day on several occasions i have no idea if that was true or not but were talking pennies here pennypincher paid a flat rate on electricity per month anyway when it varied like in the winter for heating i paid more before he moved in pennypincher told me he had a year old kid but youll probably never see him ill have him over maybe once every other weekend that kid was over almost every night of the week so in a year his kid spent probably nights at our place by contrast my girlfriend who lives in america came over to visit for six weeks pennypincher said it wasnt fair that she could come in and use our electricity not pay rent etc he announced therefore that for that period he was only going to pay two thirds of his rent council tax and bills he said all this several weeks after shed already left because that was around the time he decided to save up for the new playstation and it gave him a hefty head start and he was true to his word i had to ask my girlfriend if she was okay helping to cover it because otherwise id have been hurting financially that month of course i did not ask if his child should be charged for using our electricity and living rent free because that seemed absurd however if the situation was flipped and i had a kid im pretty sure pennypincher would have demanded my kid pay a share of the rent and bills and the petty revenge we did not part on good terms i eventually had to have a go at him for leaving dirty nappies all over the kitchen and he got extremely aggressive were talking turningbrightredscreaminginyourface angry he was a big lad and a bully and didnt like being told what to do after almost coming to blows over something i thought could be amicably resolved and wasnt even that huge an ask put them in the bin outside mate i decided it was time for me to move on in a slightly dick move i straight up cancelled all the accounts instead of transferring them to him so hed have to set all those up himself when i closed the gaselectric account it turned out we had been overpaying them for years as theyd erroneously based the entire years rate on our winter usage and then bumped it up even higher in winter including the year or so i lived with pennypincher so when i closed the account in total i was due a rebate of around i worked out the percentages for the two flatmates id had previously and met up with them for a pint and to give them their money back i did not call pennypincher he helped me pay for a fancy new tv in my new flat i got back all the money hed misered off me over the months and then some the funny thing is if he hadnt been such an arse i never would have closed those accounts and theyd have been transferred to his name instead chances are hed have gotten the rebate when it finally came to closing the account at the end of his tenancy

warning this tale contains unimaginable pettiness seriously even im embarrassed at how ludicrously petty i became just over years ago i was able to move with my two daughters into my new home its a long complicated tale involving divorce losing our home staying with my mum and im not going to bore you with that the new house was just down the street from my daughters best friend and on the day we moved in she skipped happily off down the road to visit she came back a little time later cheerily informing me how lovely it was to have her mate just down the road and i thought no more of it until later that day when a text came in from the mother i cant remember the exact words but it was a very long text telling me that id betrayed her trust because i had apparently told her daughter that her the mums boyfriend was a married man and that she no longer considered me her friend i racked my brains to work out when in the previous two years id actually even spoken to the child i particularly disliked this girl since she was rude and disrespectful and all i could come up with was hello sweetie as a generic greeting if giving her a lift i was completely unable to remember even discussing her mothers boyfriend while breathing the same air as the girl i texted the mum back telling her and trying to avoid use of phrases such as idiotic lying turd when talking of the daughter that i really didnt even mention her boyfriend while her baby was in my presence but the damage was done i was butthurt so for the last three years whenever i find a really big house spider in my home i catch it and instead of releasing it into my garden i walk the yards down the street and lob the spider over her fence ive sort of stopped doing it recently
so i used to work as a cahier for a certain store red shirts khaki pants this store has a reputation for being horrid to its employees and the one i worked at was no exception now its very common at this store to only have three or four cashiers for the whole store and i was lucky enough to be put on the items or less register it was a fairly busy day around pm when lots of people stop in on the way home to get stuff for dinner or what have you in clomps this lady ugh you can get a good idea as to the type of person she was high heels tight skirt suit jacket obnoxious hair whorange spray tan long fingernails expensive handbagetc you get the picture anyways she comes clomping in yammering on her iphone to one of her bitchbuddies about the latest celebrity gossip and gets a buggy now im not thinking anything of her at this point so i continue ringing people up twenty minutes later she comes clomping up to the register still on the phone and cuts in front of two people just walks in front of them throws her stuff on the belt and continues talking on the phone the people she just cut are standing there stunned but decide it isnt worth it and continue unloading so i start to check her out and make some small talk how are you today i get a blank stare did you find everything all right she holds her finger up and then points at her phone i am stunned at the audacity of this woman oh well just another rude customer i think to myself i continue ringing her up and then she says this on her phone yeah im gonna have to call you back this dumbass ringing me up is taking forever then she looks at me and says could you go any faster im in a big hurry fuck you woman fuck you and your stupid friends and your stupid fake tan i look her dead in the eyes maam im afraid this is the items or less lane and tou have im going to have to ask you to go use a different checkout boom bitch tl dr bitchy woman is in a hurry has items in items or less lane edit spelling
i work at a pizza delivery place in a popular strip mall we have two reserved spots for us drivers theres explicit signs that say that anyone who parks there otherwise will be towed the parking lot gets really packed at dinner time so its really a blessing for us drivers to have a reserved spot when were in and out all night today some lady parked her k mercedes slk in my spot over two hours causing me to have to spend up to minutes hunting for parking every time i had to do a delivery over the dinner rush we normally give parking abusers minutes to move well over two hours later she hadnt moved so i had her towed minutes later she came into store furious as hell my manager later reported that he actually saw her crying on the phone i have no regrets just because you have a fancy car doesnt excuse you from having to read signs edit holy crap this exploded sorry this wasnt petty enough rule number in the community said the stories should be revenge based and this one is so i thought it was alright yes i put the costcar details in there to imply that because she was probably rich and could afford it i got the average cost from the cars official website yes it was clearly marked as a towing zone why two hours we waited two hours because normally people who park there leave in minutes hours is an audacious time to think you wont get towed i kept hoping id come back from a delivery and itd be gone also i had to be present to sign the papers for the tow and i kept getting sent out on delivery had to wait for a lull
so this story is a continuous thing ive been doing for a week or two now i work in a construction based business doing hvac work i usually just float between job sites and help the other guys out there is an electrician who is the biggest asshole ive ever met he will find you and scream for leaving your tool bag in the fucking way all the time throw boxes full of expensive parts which has had to come out of the pocket of my co worker before more or less a nightmare to be around when i see his van pulling up to a job site i die a little inside so for the last few weeks ive been running my knife all the way through his electrical tape rolls so he can only get about two inch strips at a time its fantastic hearing him loose his mind hopefully he doesnt catch on 
every year a family member of mine throws a lavish new years party at their old converted farmhouse out in the country its a lovely do and i usually go along to make cocktails and generally help out one of the guys who comes along is an old perv the kind of guy who talks directly to your chest rather than your face and i always try and avoid him without being overtly rude this year he got me early by giving me a hug when he arrived and taking the opportunity to slip his hand under my jacket to take a quick tour of my back and arse i did not appreciate this i also didnt appreciate it when he turned to my male best friend asked if we were together and when my friend said we werent told him to get in there dont put up with that mate so by now im fuming my friend is fuming my mother is fuming because she also hates this guy and shes not one to be left out of a good fume much as i would have loved to kick the old bastard in the balls i didnt want to cause a scene at a fancy party my revenge was simple after ascertaining that his wife was driving every few minutes id go around with a bottle of wine to top everyone up every time i passed him i refillled his glass of red wine to the brim from a different bottle being an idiot he kept drinking i reckon i filled him up almost a dozen times with a variety of vintages by the end of the party he could barely stand up couldnt hold a conversation his wife was furious with him and it was obvious that he was going to have a monster hangover the next day i did so enjoy watching him stumbling around the muddy grounds when it was time for fireworks tldr feel me up and ill extend my hostess duties to giving you alcohol poisoning
i travel a lot for work i usually spend a lot of time in more rural smaller towns but on this trip my company put me up in a star resort in tuscon arizona it was a two week project and rather than fly home friday i figured id stay the weekend and get drunk at the resort pool swimup bars are my weakness while im usually solo on the road i actually knew a girl and a cute one at that who lived in the area the bad news was that it was the th of july weekend this hotel had quite the shindig setup for the holiday laser light show djs bands and special nightly rates to attract the locals to fill up the resort the place was packed and by friday all hotel guests needed to have the correct color wristband which was distributed by the front desk to walk the resort grounds saturday morning my friend and two of her girlfriends come meet me at the hotel we get down the pool around and its a complete shit show tons of kids tons of visibly drunk adults and not a single empty chair in sight after a few laps around the pool area my friend spots an empty chair and we drop off our towels bags etc and head to the swimup bar im two or three drinks into my day when one of the girls with me informed us that our chair had been taken over by a group of preteen girls all of us head over to the chair and i see all of our shit has been thrown off the chair why did you throw all of our stuff on the ground weve been here all day did you have anything indicating that you were saving this chair no but whatever we were here first my friend starts to argue with the preteens but i dont care enough to stick around to see who wins the bitchoff back to the bar i go a few minutes later one of the preteens who i guess didnt recognize me swims up to her mom who incidentally is sitting next to me a the bar i overhear their conversation where she said her chair was stolen her mom goes on a alcohol fueled rant where she promised to kick those slutss asses and stand up for what was rightfully hers i was about to interject and explain the actual adult side of the story when i noticed something and called over the bartender sir i need your help can you call security sure whats the issue this lady and her group do not have wristbands on the lady had a look of sheer terror i smiled i got four seats by the pool when they all escorted off the property

this summer ive been doing a bit of parttime work at a car scrapyard which sells parts both through its physical yard and also through a number of different websites to order a part through one of these websites you type your name number and car details and and then the various companies will try and beat each other to sell the part for the lowest price this particular fellow had put a request out for a mirror for his car and our quote was cheapest yay us he was put through to myself and i confirmed the details of his car and it was all going smoothly until i asked him which type of mirror he had was it black plastic or did it match the colour of his car the following is the genuine exchange which took place me which type of mirror do you have is it the same colour of your car or is it just black plastic him my car is blue mate me yes but what colour are the mirrors themselves they can be either blue like your car or just a black plastic him no i dont think you understand my car is blue mate me i understand what colour your car is but what colour is your mirror casing him oh fuck off hangs up phone a little while later he rings up again not realising hes dealing the same company and happens to be put through to me again i immediately recognise the voice and set about plotting my revenge i tell him im just going to check that we had one for his car and ill be back in a minute except it wasnt a minute minutes it took me to check the stock during which he had to listen to our awful shrill recording which repeats itself every seconds the best bit is when i eventually returned to the line i told him we didnt have any next time dont tell me to fuck off when im trying to help you out

i posted this as a comment under a different sub and was told perhaps you guys might like this story i dropped my lawn and pest control company because after the first few months my nice green grass wasnt nice or green anymore about a year passes and a rep from the company shows up not knowing that i used their services in the past offering me their services i didnt mention anything about my past experiences and told them that i was happy with my current provider but explained that my parents live not too far away and if he followed me to their house he could maybe take a look at whats going on there and see if theyre interested we went to my parents house and he looked around and told me how terribly unhealthy the grass is and explained what all the issues were and how their services would take care of it all it was at this point that i told him that his company currently handles my parents house and thats why i dropped them at my house it was worth every second of acting like i was interested just to see the look on his face
so i work retail in the south after getting my degree mostly because it allows me to take time off to focus on my photography over the past year i have had several incidents with customers being complete assholes including a woman trying to make me feel bad because she arrived almost a half hour after we closed anyway on to the story i had a customer call up and ask what the price was on a certain bag of dog food she spoke really fast and with a drawl which i am still not used to hearing having come from seattle well i asked her to repeat the question which apparently indicated im talking with an idiot she repeated the question again taking her time and pronouncing every syllable like only a complete bitch does thoroughly pissed off i decided it was time to get a little revenge i found the tag picked up the phone and as quick as i could gave my response of how much it was and how much it would cost with the discount when she asked me what i said i took my time pronouncing every syllable just to make her feel like shit her tone instantly changed never fuck with someone in retail
pesky paparazzi no alcohol on the hour flight mandatory hour stay in cuba edit comments in for those of you wondering why i chose this subreddit this may very well be petty revenge by snowden on the majority of media outlets that chose to cover such snowdenrelated fluff as pics of his girlfriend poledancing seriously these were journalists who booked an expensive flight simply to have snowden in a captive environment for an unsolicited interview or photo shoot 
i recently relived this story last night and realized it would be perfect here some background about why i didnt like the management i worked at a chain restaurant for a while and the management was very demanding and difficult especially for a minimum wage job they would understaff and expect us to just work twice as hard for the same pay they would not listen to my scheduling demandsrequests and this led to me working close after high school which sucked scheduling me frisatsun when i would ask for at least one weekend day off esp during monfri high school being difficult about taking off days two weeks in advance and acting like it was ruining their day to have to find someone to work my normal shift and god forbid anybody ever called off i found myself calling off and getting coaxed to come in partly because i was a young pushover and partly because they would be like there is literally nobody to cover you we really need you to be here this is really going to ruin my night its understandable if someone calls off often but i would call off like once every three months or so and often picked up other peoples shifts when they called me in the revenge so on a friday night i was way too sick to work especially around food i planned on taking the night off resting and going into work the next day when i felt better i called in and they did their whole no you shouldnt stay home routine after demanding to stay home my manager said fine were going to need a doctors note wtf are you kidding me im not in need of a doctor im in need of bed rest plus it costs money to go to the doctor for this shitty part time job please i went to the doctor and made sure to tell him that i was scheduled for saturday and sunday as well and felt too sick to handle peoples food he gave me a note saying he didnt want me to work until the following monday i called back that night and had my dad drop off the notice im sorry now youre going to have to find someone to cover me all weekend that doctors notice sure was a good idea i was much more sick than i thought my dad will drop the note off in a minute 
theres no malice here so maybe this is more of a petty revenge prank but im not a smart man so i was pretty proud of myself when i thought of this one also let me preface by saying i love my mom i get at least one phone call from her everyday which i dont mind i know there will come a day when shes gone that ill probably give my left arm just to get a minute phone call from her so she calls hows it going etc and tells me shes at a big box grocery store and can she pick me up anything actually mom im all out of toilet paper can you grab me some she says sure its no problem and stops by my place and drops off a big pack of tp i offer to pay her which she refuses because shes awesome like that i didnt think anything of it till i sat down for a little tinkerstinker reddit time and i realize that she bought me single ply plus its that value brand stuff thats like wiping your butt with a cactus now im all about saving money but one thing i dont skimp on is toilet paper so i call her up because i know shes fucking with me and she laughs her ass off like some kind of supervillian its on now so what am i going to do with rolls of this horrid stuff well i snuck over to my moms house yesterday afternoon hiding and replacing all her soft rolls of quilted butt sunshine with the single ply sandpaper now to just sit back and wait he who laughs last laughs loudest mom
i work at a rather large itcompany in northern sweden and every week we get a fruit delivery which consists mainly of bananas oranges apples and pears one of my colleagues whom ill refer to as mary is notorious for grabbing a huge bunch of bananas as soon as they arrive and keep them in her office as to get her daily sugar fix this has always bugged me a fair bit since i rarely get any of the delicious yellow fruits so i decided to get my petty revenge on her banana hogging last wednesday when mary snuck out early for lunch as usual i went into her office with a bunch of zip ties or cable ties if you will and attached her precious bananas to everything in sight her desk lamp her keyboard her coffee mug and as the title suggests her i tightened them real good so shed in some way have to destroy the fruits to get them off i didnt have time to snap more pictures but i hope the one of the phone will be soothing enough
i flew into cincinnati this morning and boarded the rental car shuttle the only other people on it were a middleaged man and his two daughters they looked about and years old give or take when we arrived at enterprise the man jockeyed for position to get in front of me clearly wanting to get his car first weve all done that sort of thing but what made this a dick move is he not only physically bumped me but he rushed off the shuttle leaving his young daughters to gather all the luggage while he held his position i casually picked up my bag helped his daughters with theirs and his and walked into enterprise there was one person being helped and mustbenext man was next but what he did not plan for when he shouldered me and abandoned his daughters to save minutes is how often i travel in many locations enterprise has a separate line for corporate customers and i am a corporate customer i walked right over to my special line as the customer at the desk finished the clerk motioned me over instead of the pushy asshole and he had to wait while i rented my car and while i asked her how her day was and while i told her all about mine and while i did anything else i could stall with tldr hurrying is fine but when you hurry at the expense of those around you the universe has ways of making you wait longer 
ok so i seriously dont get people im at work and i get up to go to the ladies room the building management doesnt allow for public restrooms in this building because theyve had problems in the past with homeless people mucking them up so each office in the building has a few bathroom keys that we lend out to our clients as needed or ourselves so we can use the facilities so i take the key and walk to the bathroom down the hall outside the office in come latino or philippine descended ladies searching for something im all whatevesi gotta pee gonna pee then help i unlock the door and let myself into the restroom only to hear these girls exclaim oh you need a key apparently they were in need of the restroom too the door locks behind me and i take up a stall to do my business im sitting there no longer then seconds when i hear the handle begin to jiggle furiously im like yeahcause thatll make me open the door faster once the deed was finished hands washed i still heard these girls out the door where i distinctly hear this sentence stupid white puta hurry the fuck up fat ass yeah cause now i really want to answer the door so i sit and wait i got time im off the clock after another mins of jiggling cursing and pounding on the door i hear them walk off so i take my leave i enter the office my door to it which is locked just in time to hear fuck now how we gonna get in funny thing had they just waited patiently out in the hallway without being little jackasses about it i wouldnt have had a problem holding the door open for these ladies to use the restroom regardless if they had a key or not sorrynotsorry edit wow thanks for the over upvotes glad you all enjoyed my passive aggressive stance on bathroom privileges lol 
this dude in front of me in the checkout line was being very obnoxious he was wearing a deadpool mask and thought that gave him liberty to harass customers and yell obscenities i didnt even know that you could wear masks like that in grocery stores because you dont want people thinking your going to rob the place anyway hes messing with people while hes being rung up he bought items and took literally minutes of my time so after he leaves i find him in the parking like seconds later because i bought items and am a human being about purchasing etiquette so as he is putting his grocery bag in the passenger seat of his car i thought it would be funny to sprint at his car crouch by his back wheels for two seconds and run away as quickly as possible i was halfway across the parking lot by the time he realized what happened i drove by two minutes later it was dark and he didnt recognize me he was still checking to see what i did to fuck with his car justice served
quite some years ago my dad had done something to piss me off and i finally decided to take action my revenge was reversing the position of every second coat hanger on both of his clothing racks so he would never be able to remove more than one hanger at a time take that
i work in a dusty old call center that uses terrible and outdated computers that are prone to breaking down when you look at them the wrong way the full time staff is comprised of computer illiterate women all of whom i suspect have a lower than average level of intelligence the day the initial incident took place i was the acting supervisor one particular employee hates it when i supervise as im a female in my early s while she is at least lets call this other person shannon shannon was experiencing a lowlevel computer problem in that her messages were not being sent out on time i was able to resend the messages without issue but couldnt solve the problem itself because it was a problem with the computer and there is no way in hell i think i can fix that i told her to come to me if she had the issue again and id send the messages out on time i moved on to the next issue which was actually a problem and needed to be looked into right away this made her suuuuper angry she stood up at her station pointed a wiry old finger at me and started yelling you dont fucking care about this problem and i cant get and god damn help around this shit hole its a small work space shared by like seven people everyone had to stop what they were doing put their calls on mute because she was loud enough to be heard in the background she stormed off who the hell does that she just left she signed herself out with the explanation being left frustrated as thats not a reasonable excuse to leave work early at all i had to send an email to the management team explaining the entire situation she was given a warning for job abandonment but thats not where it ended when she was being given the warning she told them she was refusing to listen so she sat slumped forward in her chair and pretended to go to sleep management had to bring in our union rep as she refused to speak with them she was also written up for professionalism at some point she decided it was my fault and when i came in for my next shift she immediately came over to me she stood about two inches from my face and told me that shed be watching me for any misstep and that i had to watch my back from now on because she knows where the security cameras cant see which i understood as a vague threat of physical violence but whatever this all took place about a month ago since then shes been nothing but sass and refuses to speak with me even when im supervising this past friday i had to go over a new policy with her and saw that she had facebook open on her computer facebook is strictly banned at our workplace she didnt even make an effort to hide it just looked up at me with this smug expression as if to say what are you going to do about it obviously i told the manager because i hate that bitch with a frightening passion he said that management probably wont be doing anything as theyve known about her facebooking habits for awhile now heres the revenge about an hour ago i went to the computer she exclusively uses when shes at work and enabled the content blocker for all websites that have not been rated i enabled a password so she cant go around it so not only has facebook been blocked but all the websites that shes been using to look for a new job are gone too there was some effort involved as we do use the internet for a few clients and i had to find the pages of every single client we take calls for and enable their web pages to be allowed it took about an hour but im giddy with glee at the thought of her coming in to write some shitty status update about her shitty grandkids and nope this website has been blocked you want to use company time to look for a new job also not happening sorry bitch better luck next time tldr nasty old woman that works with me was weirdly aggressive i blocked the sites she browses i think she might stab me but it will definitely have been worth it

i finally have a good story to share with this sub it happened today i was just walking back to my car from class and had to cross the professors parking lot to get to the student lot i came across an older man getting into his car and i noticed that his large coffee cup is still on the roof of his car ive done this before and really appreciate when someone tells me that im about to drive off with my drink on the roof so why not pay it forward right hey mister you in the most condescending tone i have ever heard no its doctor oh sorry doctornevermind so i just stood there and watched as doctor asshole throws his camry in reverse spilling his full cup of coffee all over his windshield and window dr snarky flashes me a look that could only be a look of remorse mixed with anger he probably realized that i was just trying to help but was pissed that i decided not to he didnt even get out of the car he just sped off edit i a word 
my grandpa was a farmer he lived in a small town and from the stories ive heard was a generous strong stand up man of few words he didnt boast or call people out thats not to say he allowed anyone to walk over him but he didnt go for big confrontations he was smarter than that and knew that you often lose as much as you gain in confrontations this was especially true in small farm towns where everyone depends on one another he kept tanks of both diesel and gasoline on his farm he noticed that over the course of several weeks his gasoline level was dropping faster than his usage one of his neighbors must have been pulling up at night and stealing one tank of gas at a time he was more amused than angry on the next fill up he quietly asked the fuel truck driver to swap the tanks not a week later just after dawn he was driving his tractor along the main road to his second field he came across a neighbor having car trouble as he got down to help he smiled having an idea what was amiss he pulled the gas cap and noted that the fuel smelled like diesel the man acted surprised grandpa chained the car up to his tractor and towed him home the fuel thieving stopped on that day no big deal was made
i was shopping at wally world once and saw a lady put a package of frozen chicken on a shelf big package of frozen nuggets freezer section two aisles over and she just pulled it out and stuck it on the shelf with the chips being the kind of guy that i am i was not going to let her get away with this i walk over pick up the nuggets and drop them back into her cart while she was not looking she saw the nuggets a few moments later and you could tell she was thinking that she was sure she had gotten rid of them already she shrugs and puts them on a shelf again and walks off rinse lather repeat i continue to pick up the package and put it in her cart of items several times the first couple of times it was just petty then it started to get fun and an awesome game not only that but several people were following watching the fun the lady would put it on a shelf walk away and go an aisle over i would run grab the nuggets and follow as would the rest of the people watching she would come back from getting a bottle of water and see the chicken half buried under the cake mix she got the row before she would twitch a little start looking around and kinda get antsy sometimes she would put it on a shelf right away sometimes she would carry it a little ways and then put it on a shelf well fun has to stop and she almost caught me i had slipped the nuggets back into her cart but some items fell over and she heard it she didnt catch me doing it but she did see me standing some five feet away with an evil grin on my face she grabbed the bag and starts throwing a huge fit right in the middle of the store the kind of fit where a person doesnt say words so much as grunts and incoherent babble she then takes the bag of nuggets raises it over her head and slams them down on the floor causing a shower of nuggets to fly all over the place including right up on the shoes of the store manager and a police officer seems someone let the store manager know what i was doing to the woman and decided to see for himself the officer just happened to be coming off duty getting something they both tell the lady that she has to pay for her items including the destroyed bag of nuggets and leave the store she was pissed she pointed in my direction and then found that i was not there i backed away and out as soon as the bag exploded which caused her to just start foaming at the mouth she paid she left she was told never to come back edit aisle please isle an island 
this is my first year at college and so far everythings been great except for one part which i figured this thread would enjoy i live in the honors freshman dorm building which has significantly less people than any other building so we only have bathrooms per floor one for each side with showers per bathroom one with a significant amount of space and one blocked off by handicapped seating folded up considering the small amount of people living here we all know each other on a moderately well basis enough to know how each others schedules usually are there is one person on my floor who likes to take showers while listening to music which normally wouldnt be a problem if his taste was not incredibly southern country mixed with incredibly vulgar rap we have no problems if he is there first to shower and plays it but the general rule is to not play music if someone else is already showering as they likely dont want to hear this to make up for this hes decided to get to the showers just early enough to beat the first person there and take both the nice shower without the handicapped foldup seat and play his music this first person is usually me ive decided ive had enough of listening to his terrible music and deal with the worse shower its been making my mornings horrible and forms a headache too early so for the past month or so ive been sacrificing sleep and getting up to shower a couple minutes early until he catches on first time about minutes early he caught on and came before then second time minutes early he still catches on and starts coming even earlier this has gone on for about or weeks enough for him to be trained to shower almost half an hour before he normally would at the beginning of the year ive also tracked about how long he takes every morning which is about half an hour this morning my plan worked to perfection i got to sleep in as long as i possibly could have and when i woke up and headed to the showers i passed him leaving from the nice shower it was definitely a good morning for me 
i am back living at my familys house temporarily and ive noticed recently that the bad habit of not cleaning up after themselves after cooking has now turned into just flat out not putting the cooked leftovers away at all it is such a shame that especially on a tight budget any food should go to waste so i figure as a good house guest i should do my fair share of cleaning but my parents are grown ass people and my sisters are old enough to live on their own and maybe its because ive recently come back after four years of independence and cultivating young adult skills but this sort of gets under my skin when im putting the food away almost every night at in the morning for grown ass adults yes people just go to bed without putting this away the food will go bad if i didnt ive seen it happen its why i started putting it away so i started putting the food away in inappropriate containers small portions of food in exceedingly large tupperware containers putting away vegetables in the cheese drawer filling medium ziplock bags with spaghetti complete with sauce and meatballs and not just a little bit to the brim needlessly separating ingredients that could easily be lumped together or vice versa they get so annoyed with me for taking up unnecessary space in the fridge they think i have no idea how to put things away at least they made it to the god damn refrigerator im hoping one day theyll have enough of a problem theyll start doing it for themselves again or maybe itll just have to wait until i move out and they wonder why none of the food gets put away either way i am getting my revenge one gallon sized ziplock bag with only five chicken nuggets in it at a time 
so i thought id share another tale from my time working at a pool store several years ago be forewarned this is a serious wall of text coming as anyone who has worked in retail knows you will always have at least a few quirky regulars who come in to your store sometimes its a good kind of quirky like she bakes cookies a lot and so brings us some when she comes in sometimes however its a bad kind of quirky this one customer we used to have was the bad kind of quirky this customer not his real name but well call him mr rogers because i always thought he looked like he could be mr rogers evil twin brother had a nasty habit of coming in to the store about min before we close this would happen every time he came now when doing a water test back then it would take a couple of minutes we didnt have those fancy colorimeters that use lasers to measure the chemicals we were doing oldfashioned titration and using other reagents to measure everything normally it didnt take too long but it definitely took longer after we had already cleaned everything up for the night not to mention it can be a messy process meaning wed have to clean everything again before we close up he would come in get his water tested ask a million unnecessary or unanswerable questions mr rogers does the turboshock come in a lb bucket me no sorry it just comes in lb mr rogers why me and tap impatiently waiting for everything making me feel like i was defusing a bomb most of the time we got him out either right as we were closing or a couple of minutes after but seeing his car pull up at was enough to turn an ok day into a fullon panic attack so one day i was at a highschool soccer game when who do i happen to see but mr rogers he was sitting a couple of rows ahead of me and didnt notice that i was there his granddaughter apparently was on the jr high team and he was there to see her i debated whether or not to say anything to him but i decided against it since i doubted he even remembered who i was and then completely by accident i overheard him talking to one of his friends mr rogers told his friend what he thought was the secret to getting good service at any place he claimed that by coming in at the last minute right before they closed he was guaranteed swift attention to his needs mr rogers elaborated that the intense desire to go home was enough of a motivator to ensure this attention to detail after all he said why should they get rewarded if i dont get the best possible service he even went so far as to use our business as one of his many examples of places he knows for a fact that this technique works i thought about confronting him right then and there but i managed to restrain myself by the time the minutes were up in the match i had already formulated the basis of a plan the next day i went to my manager the sweet older lady from my last post and told her about what i had overheard she was furious she wanted to refuse him service shred his file and tell him to pull his crap somewhere else but i told her i had an idea of a way to get back at him a little bit and she agreed the next time mr rogers came into the store of course at til closing we made sure to treat him like a king we gave his water sample every test under the sun ph alkalinity calcium free chlorine total chlorine copper iron phosphates total dissolved solids and many many more no test was too obscure for mr rogers when he asked why we were doing so many tests we told him that we wanted to make sure that everything was perfect we wanted no stone left unturned but my water is clear protested mr rogers no no we just want it to stay that way after all we would be remiss if your perfect water turned green overnight so we continued to do tests all the while his foot was tapping tapping tapping to the same beat as the clock on the wall we found tiny fluctuations in chemicals that were normally too small to make a fuss over and blew them up into minor catastrophes that had to be dealt with immediately we advised him on the best way to mix his chlorine shock to optimize its effectiveness we discussed the merits and pitfalls of potentially switching to a saltwater system then we talked about baquacil and how he could switch to that as well if he was having issues with the chlorine but im not it looks great we took him on a minitour of some of our newer stock explaining in excruciating detail how it all works finally when i started talking about the new robotic vacuum cleaners that were starting to come out for residential use he made it very clear that he had had enough by now it was well past closing time we had locked the front door and turned off the front set of lights some time ago he was trapped and he knew it he looked at me and my manager and asked why are you doing this why are you taking so long and why are you talking to me about things i dont care about my manager looked him in the eye and with no hint of a smile or any sort of care in her voice she said we just want to give you the best possible service it took a second but then he got it someone had let his secret slip his foot stopped tapping and the only thing that he could say was oh so we decided the torture was over we let him go after that and while he did continue to come to our store and get excellent service i might add he no longer came minutes to closing it was one of the only times ive ever felt such sweet justice in my retail career i will always treasure that moment tldr guy comes in minutes before closing to get better service so we gave him the best service of his life as a form of torture

my car had a radar detector installed by its previous owner i dont rely very much on it but today it alerted during my commute while i was being tailgated by a jerk who didnt give me ten seconds to change lanes coming to the top of a hill i move out of the left lane and jerk passes me just as we get another blast of kaband and the state trooper comes into view i took the next exit and didnt see him pulled over but i saw the trooper pulling out when he went past at about mph

so a little backstory earlier this year i was working in a call centre for a company that provided maintenance services like mechanics or plumbers to people on welfare theyd call us up apply for credit set up deductions from their welfare payments and wed organise their maintenance as soon as possible now working in a call centre dealing only with callers on welfare sounds like it would be hell surprisingly of our customers were great and really thankful for the service mostly they were just recieving a family payment or something like that but still worked part time or full time a further were not easy to deal with but i like to think that i was good at my job and we got there in the end but theres always that customer who makes you question whats wrong with humanity this is the story of one such customer dickbag so its a sunday evening at pm when dickbag calls hes a bit blunt but not unpleasant at first he needs his car fixed so we go through the application process its pretty simple like what payment do you receive how much per fortnight stuff like that we get to the end hes all approved we just have the terms and conditions left to run through before its all put through me ok dickbag we just need to run through some terms and conditions and well finalise your order dickbag yep when do i take my car in me once the order goes through we send you some paperwork in an email you can esign it and send it back we will also need confirmation from centrelink that your deductions are set up correctly then well organise a time if you can get that paperwork done and the payments set up tonight centrlink will confirm with us tomorrow and we should have a time by thursday or friday at the very latest db friday what the f am i supposed to do until friday f i knew you cs were a fin waste of time me trying to be sympathetic yeah sorry db i know its not ideal but unfortunately thats the company policy i cant do anything better than thursday very sorry for the inconvenience db f you dont give me that bulls now at this point i hung up the company has a zero abuse policy and a three strike policy third offense and you can no longer receive services from us the times not pm and after that i figure hes not interested so i add a note to his file about the abuse and close it up at pm it rings again db as if nothings happened yeah thursday will have to do i guess me oh im really sorry i closed your file off well just have to run through the application process again but we should be able to get it done a lot quicker this time db you fing c you did this deliberately ill fin come down there me db youre abusing me again im going to disconnect the call and ill let you know now that we have a strike policy so if you abuse the next person you talk to youll be black listed i hang up its pm and i head home so the following morning i roll into work at am for the late shift and my boss is grinning the minute she sees me db tried calling back after the phones diverted to voicemail the night before and requested a call back because of the reports of abusive behaviour my manager called him back he complained and asked that the calls be listened to because i was unprofessional she promised she would and started the application process with him again but today was a little different we had introduced credit checks starting that morning and you guessed it db was not approved he went on a tirade and got himself blacklisted after my manager listened to the calls she waited for me to come in and let me hit the blacklist button tldr guy was a dick to me at the wrong time and i got some sweet unintentional revenge
ok short one here as told by my old roommate jack when jack was young in high school he had a pacemaker implanted in his chest due to a heart condition jack also worked as a cashier at a grocery store in a nicer part of town before we met one thing he hated was dealing with asshole customers but he had the best petty way of exacting petty revenge ive ever known if a customer was being rude to him and paying with a card jack would tell them im sorry i have to swipe your card here on the register the card swiper next to you doesnt work the customer would hand jack their card and he would swipe it across his chest before he would swipe it at the register when jack did this he made sure it would pass over his pacemaker causing it to erase the data on the magnetic strip so of course the card would be declined much to the frustration of the customer if they tried to get him to manually enter in the info on the card he would tell them sorry our store policy doesnt allow that jack said he loved to see the customer sulk off to put their groceries back tldr bionic kid kills your card if youre an ass in the checkout lane

alright this didnt happen to me but i did witness it this happened when i just started working on towboats i was a greenhand along with another guy we had just both came from deckhand school and were both put on the same towboat having already spent two weeks in school we werent given anytime to go do any shopping or anything else so we were put on the boat with pretty much the same stuff as we came to deckhand class with minus what we used during the class the lead man on deck we will call him lm was a pretty cool guy and always wore overalls always the greenhand that was put on the vessel with me we will call him bum so bum and lm both chewed tobacco and bum was quickly running out of his remaining tobacco in the first week and we still had weeks to go before we got to go home lm was a pretty cool guy and told bum that since it was his first hitch that he wouldnt mind sharing his chewing tobacco with him but only for this first hitch he told him that he understood that he didnt know how much to bring since this was his first time being out here but that next hitch he would have to bring enough for the entire four weeks or he is on his own bum quickly agreed and expressed thanks so next weeks went by uneventful bum and i went home two weeks later we were back out there again this time bum barely brought more tobacco than he did the previous time and was out of chewing tobacco halfway through his hitch he started bumming off of lm again lm was a cool guy but i could tell he was upset about it so one day we are on the head of tow at the furthest end from the vessel on the barges or unit of barges we push and we are about to make a lock its just me and lm at the head he is helping me make the lock he told me had a plan to get bum to stop bumming it was near watch change so bum was coming out to relieve me the first thing bum ask for is a chew from lm lm agreed and pulled out a bag of chewing tobacco that was nearly empty save for one last chew bum was kinda hesitant about taking his last chew but lm insisted saying it wasnt a problem it didnt take long for bum to lose his guilt about taking lms chew and took his last chew from that bag as soon as bum started chewing lm immediately pulled out a brand new bag and opened it up with bum watching lm pissed into the bag and sealed it back up bum asked him what the hell he was doing lm simply told him that his grandfather had told him when he was a kid that if you pissed in a fresh bag of chew it will keep it fresher longer bum immediately started vomiting on the barge lm later told me that it was worth wasting a bag of chew for that and bum never did ask for any more chew from him tldr guy doesnt bring enough of his own chew and ends up getting pranked
sorry this is long but oh so sweet this guy that went to my high school jimmy was the absolute worst he was the typical asshole jockeveryone let him get away with shit but i acted cordial around him because we shared mutual friends and classes i would sometimes call him out in a teasing way so he thought we were even friends my main beef with him was the way he treated girls though jimmy wasnt very attractive he coasted on popularity and our school was very small with more girls than boys he mostly preyed on underclassmen my first interaction with him was turning him down as a freshman because he seemed creepy but he was a great charmer and manipulator when he wanted to be so i witnessed over and over again as hed suck in one of my friends who would be convinced that hes changed for her and being genuinely nice this time and then turn on the assholery once she was emotionally invested he dated one of my friends jane who is the sweetest person in the world she was going through some tough times at home with a prolonged family illness and jimmy just would not give her a break telling her shes gaining weight flirting with other girls in front of her general toying of her emotions you could tell she was super stressed out and finally she broke up with him wahoo but it didnt end there we had assigned seats in computer class and i sat between jimmy and janes sister beth who is equally sweet on the other side of jimmy sat all of his jock friends close to mr teachers desk so he could try to keep them in check where they would act obnoxious and talk loud so that the whole room could hear about how awesome they were right after the breakup jimmy talked about how hes over it and already has a few public school sluts lined up lols private school lifethis was the equivalent of having a girlfriend you met on vacation so she lives in a different city and other stuff that was really disrespectful to jane and it seemed very intentionally done in front of beth who was not a confrontational person i plotted jimmy was very insecure about his intelligence since he was put in the spotlight so often it was easy to see that while he could get an a at getting girls to send him nudes he struggled academically so i left lunch early one day to get in the computer room before everyone else i hooked up an extra mouse and keyboard into his computer pulling the cords behind and underneath the desk so that the mouse and board could rest hidden under my pullout keyboard there was a lot of hidden room they sat just out of view above my own keyboard jimmy made a loud and unnecessary entrance as usual but when he tried to log in to his computer to start the assignment he just could not get it right this is because i would sneakily tap a key as he would type in his student password he tries a few more times before yelping for help from mr teacher who looks annoyed after typing in jimmys information just fine maybe you had your password wrong he says but jimmy is insistent that he isnt that stupid and something is wrong with the computer i tormented jimmy for weeks pushing the extra keyboard and mouse as far up as i could to hide it in between classes he would put his mouse icon over a button and then id slightly wiggle my extra mouse before he clicked on it infuriating jimmy that he could not select something inputting passwords and other information was often impossible his documents were full of typos he would type a word and i would just press one letter to throw him off and then hed try again only for the same thing to happen pretty soon he just used spellcheck instead but rightclicking that function was difficult for him when i was paying attention open the task manager while hes in a program hed look away and id close a window or document or just press backspace until he turned around i was careful to be pretty inconsistentwhen other people were looking id back off to make him look crazy whatever hed been trying to do would always work when jimmy called the teacher over my movements were minute and mixed in seamlessly as i typed on my real keyboard i started to punish him this way wandering eye wandering mouse while hes trying to play a game distracted as he bragged to his friend about texting with that nave freshman oh look his powerpoint text boxes somehow all got rearranged ignore new girlfriend because its funny unexpected shutdown because losing unsaved work is funnier one time he tried to reset a password where the characters are replaced with dots for privacy and i put a number at the end of his new password and the same thing when he confirmed the password this new password then didnt work and he couldnt reset it again without knowing the current password jimmy was going nuts but it was all so subtle that his complaints made him look like a crazy person who didnt know how to use a computer he insisted over and over again that something was wrong with the computer his assignments took longer so he had less time to horse around with his friends people started to talk about how irritable and unpleasant he was during computer class and people would even tease him about not being able to use technology if he had any problems with his iphone or anything one time when i was sure that no one else was looking and jimmy didnt even have his hands on anything i wiggled the mouse slightly back and forth as he stared at the screen his eyes widen and he shouts look interrupting mr teachers lecture i stop it was doing it my mouse was moving and i wasnt even doing anything we all look at each other in disbelief over jimmys delusions as he keeps yelling myself and beth included although we were laughing on the inside giddy at the thought of telling jane later about jimmys meltdown thats it mr teacher said worn thin over jimmys incompetence no one else is having problems with that computer youre just not compatible i guess move to that one he points to a computer far away from his buddies and any other students which is usually used by people giving presentations or student teachers jimmy protests suggesting mr teacher just fix it but at this point jimmy is pretty done with that computer too we werent bothered by jimmy too much the rest of the year in that class but to my surprise jimmy still had problems almost all the stuff i was doing he stopped complaining since it made him look like he was just hopeless with simple tasks but he would still ask me questions about what it could be after class since he thought i was relatively good with computers one day alone in the computer room i was inspecting the computer that jimmy used when mr teacher comes in he sat down at his desk and got a sly look on his face as he messed with a cordless mouse which wiggled around on jimmys screen wifi he explained turned out mr teacher knew what i was doing all along he hated dealing with jimmy too and distracting him meant less class disruption but after his meltdown jimmy just raged quietly in his corner as he failed to engage his faraway friends tldr guy is a douche to my friend plug a secret mouse and keyboard into his computer and mess with him he goes crazy and everyone talks about it edit for more info we had a pretty relaxed atmosphere our teacher was a young lad who just taught an easy class in order to be a coach and he was jimmys track coach so even though jimmy annoyed the shit out of him during class they joked around a lot at our school the real authority was with the coaches so a prank like this between them would have been a big deal he was the kind of teacher that let us spend a lot of time playing games and helped us with senior pranks as long as they were tame enough he was just a few years out of college and only really messed with jimmy when he was a disruption jimmy really actually was bad with computers at one point he thought his macbook was totally broken because he accidentally leaned on the dim screen button so his screen was black he would never notice anything unusual plugged into his computer i know that using bluetooth doesnt always require a usb and it has been many years since i was in high school so perhaps thats what the teacher meanti am really not that great with that stuff myself jimmy only thought i was good with computers because he was amazed by things like keyboard shortcuts 
friend of mine used to be an airline pilot he was trying to get to sleep one night for a very early wakeup the following morning the people next door were being loud idiots laughing bumping into the shared wall tv blaring etc my buddy complained to the front desk which quieted the idiots down briefly but their loud behavior soon continued on into the night his revenge just before leaving the hotel at about am he set the clock radio alarm to blast country music at am turned it around with the speaker pressed right up against the shared wall set the volume to max and left
saw a revenge story thats been going on for a while and it reminded me of my story so i was a teenager the first time my family got an electric can opener having never even seen one before i had no clue how to use it they had bought it while i was at work and taught my then around year old little brother how to use it when i asked my parents told me to make him teach me ok i can do that except when i went to ask him he wouldnt tell me instead he laughed hysterically about how he was so much younger than me and knew how and i didnt he also added that i must be pretty stupid if i didnt know already the revenge later that day i messed around with it and figured out how to work it he doesnt know that though hes now and im whenever hes home and i need a can opened i make him stop whatever hes doing and come help me he laughs the entire time about how stupid i am that i cant figure it out still i just smile 
i work retail and when i am ringing someone out im cheery and welcoming i explain our rewards program and incentives until someone makes me mad by cutting me off or being rude i guide them through the credit card process go ahead and swipe press yes for me go ahead and confirm one more time on the pad people get easily distracted and need their hand held through this process but when youre rude i dont say anything we both just stand there waiting and when they look at me to see what the hold up is i just smile only then do they realize its on them to press ok yes or whatever super petty but it makes me feel good okay

i live in an apartment building that has seven apartments besides mine and we all share a large bank of mailboxes we get lots of junk mail here i hate it but i just throw it away and go on about my day my neighbors not so much a few of the other residents have taken to piling up their junk mail on top of the mailbox this looks really bad and trashy and ends up falling all over the ground and getting everywhere in the hall on top of that it just ends up staying there untill i clean it up because we dont really have a cleaning crew for the halls so i have started looking at the address on the mail and leaving it in front of the doors of the people who left it out seems to be working so far tldr clean up your own trash please

i wasnt personally the one doing the revenge here but it was truly perfect and i thought you guys might enjoy so as many of you know the dmv is an overcrowded hell hole where americans get ids or drivers licenses the waiting area works by people taking numbers and going up to the desk when the number is called this becomes important later in an attempt to avoid an hour long wait in a downgraded waiting room i showed up before it opened and waited like a black friday sale at walmart five or so other people had the same idea and at the moment i was second in line just as the doors finally opened some douche who had just pulled up sprints through the doors and grabs the second ticket pissing off me and the four people behind me nobody does anything though we all understand that the dmv brings out the worst slice of humanity the lady behind the counter on the other hand doesnt take his shit number one she called and took care of the first guy who was renewing a license or something next she called number three the douches eyes pop right out of his head he storms up and says what the fuck i was number two and throws his ticket on the counter she sweeps it off says not anymore please take another ticket and calls for number three again douchebag screams with frustration and storms out and most of the waiting room is either cracking up or applauding tldr underpaid worker delivers a metaphorical kick to the manhood
when i was in fourth grade there was a kid that always picked on me at one point point he started sneaking into the boys room after me and he would come up behind me and try to push me over while i was using the urinal it was annoying embarassing and sometimes messy then i began to listen for him to come up behind me one day out of the corner of my eye i saw him sneak up behind me just as he was ready to give me a shove i turned around and peed all over him never had problems after that
so this story happened over the summer when i was working in a mini supermarkettype shop the place i come from is by the coast and attracts a lot of tourists over the summer who unfortunately tend to be rude noisy and as my unpc grandfather would say common as muck despite the poor pay and rude customers i enjoyed the job it was pretty easy a relaxed environment and the other staff were all great plus it was money for university so i was happy for the work one particular afternoon i was working on the till point at the front of the shop when a huge man in a wife beater vest who looked in his mid thirties stormed in mind you he wasnt fat but he must have been about absolutely ripped in muscles covered in tattoos with a clean shaven head he was closely followed by a group of about four other men who all looked very similar albeit with varying amounts of hair and a particularly smug looking bleach blonde woman hanging on his arm myself being a year old skinny girl it was initially somewhat intimidating especially the attitude they stormed in with the bold man made a straight line for the counter barging straight past an elderly couple on the way up to the till and physically elbowing a woman with a pushchair out of his way when he reached the counter he leaned over me and slammed the object in his hand straight down on the desk it was a jar of the supermarkets ownbrand salsa dip before i had a chance to ask him what was wrong he moved his face closer to mine this fucking jar you sell has been fused shut and wont fucking open i want my fucking money back and some compensation for having to drive all the fucking way back to your shitty shop he yelled straight into my face whats wrong with it sorry i asked quietly a bit confused about the anger over a jar of dip pretty much everybody in the shop had stopped what they were doing at this point and i felt all of their gazes as they looked over open your fucking ears bitch it wont fucking open he yelled back now this made me angry if somebody approached me nicely id always do my best to help them out but coming right in my face yelling calling me names and swearing was not okay my boss was out on his lunch and the only other people working were a year old girl chloe and lewis who was shorter and skinnier than me i knew i had to deal with this by myself would you like me to try and open it i offered he and his friends started laughing and his girlfriend gave me a pitying look no offense love but if i cant open it some fucking pussy southern bitch aint gonna i heard a small gasp from the elderly woman see this made me more mad while i may not be big and intimidating i quite regularly get referred to as feisty by my best friends and a string of ex boyfriends not always in a complimentary way also being a small woman lacking muscle and having lived on my own since the age of i was well aware of all the little tricks of opening something which didnt want to budge without any help no let me try i shot at him finding some confidence he laughed stupid bitch he muttered to the vapid blowup doll on his arm she giggled i took the jar and gently tapped the rim on the edge of the counter looking him in the eye the entire time one two three all of the group sneered and were laughing i lifted up the jar and without breaking eye contact gently twisted the lid it popped right open the laughing abruptly stopped what the one of his mates muttered they all looked at their big bold friend and started to laugh the girl on his arm sharply detached herself and started giggling hysterically youre the fucking pussy mate one howled that lass is a quarter your size another ribbed he nervously glanced around not only were his friends in hysterics but everybody in the shop was looking over nudging one another and laughing at him slowly his face went bright red with the colour stretching all the way up to his bald head as he realised what an idiot id made him look he shot his hand forward and grabbed the jar the lid wasnt attached and fell off onto the floor he quickly ducked down and grabbed it as he got up visibly humiliated he grabbed his girl by the hand and practically ran towards the door shoulders hunched and head down but just as he reached the door and looked back at his friends i raised my hand put on the biggest fuckyou retail fake smile i could muster and yelled out enjoy your dip in a cheery voice another wave of laughter erupted in the shop and he dashed straight out call me names and intimidate me at work ill humiliate you in front of a shop full of people
im selling a guy and his dad a computer at work the dad doesnt seem to speak english at all so he speaks chinese to his son and has him translate not a big deal because the son actually speaks pretty good english everything is going fine until i take them over to the register and start ringing them up the dad shoots off something to his son in chinese and his son translates is there a discount for what reason i ask this is my goto response every time i have an asian customer ask for a discount for the sake of a discount to kinda demonstrate to them that we dont haggle here uhjust because oh no sorry we dont do that here my response didnt make the dad very happy he practically throws his credit card at his son repeatedly speaking in chinese under his breath i can tell hes mad at me and hes probably talking shit about me right now the register prints the receipt and prompts me to compare the customers signature on his card to the one he wrote on the card scanner as im trying to compare signatures i really cant read the dad miraculously learns how to speak english oh do you low chinese he asks in his very obvious guangdong accent he has a very sheepish grin on his face like hes not sure he should be embarrassed or not i gather that he thinks im able to read his signatures so he thinks i speak mandarin he knows that even if i did speak mandarin i would have no idea what he was saying to his son because they were speaking in their local language i decide to fuck with him just for the hell of it i smile and respond with one of the only cantonese words i knowhaih which means yes the two customers eyes grew to the size of dinner plates before they thanked me and scurried off with their merchandise maybe think again before you assume an american cant speak cantonese 
so last year my boss more specifically my bosss bosss boss said no halloween costumes next year i was quite annoyed because no one has ever complained or had an issue with the costumes i and my coworkers have worn so i wondered how could i wear a costume without getting in trouble well i figured they cant get me in trouble for over dressing for work yes very petty and i didnt get a complaint all day when people asked what i was i let them decide since it wasnt officially a costume but simple work attire 
i used to work at a large grocery store chain in canada if you live up here you can probably guess it theres a coffee place in our store so people are walking around with coffee all the time it always ticked me off when someone would leave an empty cup in my department so what i began to do was everytime i saw someone walk into my department with a drink then leave without one i knew it was my chance to strike id go down the isle they were just in find their empty drink and run out of my department after them id always aproach them as nicely as possible excuse me sirmiss you forgot your drink and hand them back their trash id try and have the biggest fake smile when i did it too
i work at a small cafe and we recently got some new coffee spoons they are the same style as our old ones but due to an ordering error are about a centimetre shorter than our regular spoons we kept them anyway just for emergencies so i now i have the perfect petty revenge mildly annoying customer good luck reaching the bottom of your coffee cup enjoy your granulated sugar sludge becasue you couldnt stir to dissolve it properly
i was at the grocery store today during a holiday today is the memorial day in us that most people have off from work but the poor grocery store workers are slammed on this day i hate going to the grocery store when it is busy but i had to go for a few essential items i affectionately called this one of my no cart trips even though i needed to pick up a few heavier items sack of potatoes litre drinks a few smaller items i grabbed a basket weaved my way through the people as efficiently as possible and made my way to the checkout i managed to find a line that was just finishing up and it wasnt even an express and i bagged my stuff up and went on my way my checkout lane was the second one furthest from the door so there is a fairly large aisle to walk down to make it to the door the one that is behind the checkout area it is a straight path that most stores have there was a woman behind me with a cart from the register one lane down but shes in no hurry it seems she keeps a little distance behind me however we approach an obstacle on the way to the exit there is a woman standing at a lotto machine entering her choices behind her there is a very large stereotypical biker looking man standing with his arms crossed facing my direction im not sure if he was at the lane of checkout that is right there but there is a cart on the other side of him and groceries piling up waiting for someone to bag them as i approach i give a friendly pardon me looks me in the eyes does not move an inch excuse me sir nothing ok cart lady will need more room than i do but i am still taking up more room than i typically do since i have an arm full of grocery bags okay bags but they were still large at my side i proceed to walk in the tiny space i could pretty much just fit in if i walked sideways without grocery bags between him and the cart due to the limitations in the space i had to walk through i was forced to slam the drinks into his hip he had a reaction that was something like unnfff he uncrossed his arms and took a step back since he had just been blasted by all lbs of me he looks at the cart lady and said jeeze some people are so rude her response was the best yeah when people who are blocking the aisle dont move after someone says pardon and excuse me youre right you were rude sir you should get out of my way now too i imagine a cart might hurt running into you i didnt see his reaction but she proceeded behind me so im guessing he moved out of the way with his jaw on the floor 
background in melbourne motorcycles are encouraged to park on ours are very wide and frees all roadside parking for cars i get back to my bike as a kg societal drain returns to her range rover in the roadside carpark in front of me i finish attiring my helmet and gloves then patiently sit on my bike while she continues her phone conversation perhaps obliviously with her tailgate open and standing in my path to the road a couple of minutes pass she may not be aware i wish to leave my bikes radiator fan is broken so i leave the engine off if i need to stop for more than a few minutes i lift my visor and ask if she minds closing her tailgate and allowing me through i get the middle finger and various expletives typical of short fat woman syndrome no big deal i walk my bike backwards and behind the next car push it on the road and walk it next to her again she hasnt noticed me engine is still off so i hold the throttle wide open and start it my bike has a loud exhaust the sudden revs and obscenely loud noise startled her like water rippling through a lake as her fat rolls jiggled and arm flinched dropping her iphone in fright as i rode away i wished i heard the sound a phone makes as it transforms into thousands of glass shards

so to keep a long story short i have had a frustrating relationship with the head of an organization that operates on the same university campus that i work he has been purposely avoiding my emails and all that jazz i got my revenge this afternoon when they had an event on campus but my department was required to set up their pa system the organizations head who had been ignoring me was being interviewed and recorded to be played on the evening news and they decided the best spot to do the interview was right where i was setting everything up about feet from one of my larger speakers in fact so i of course had to do my due diligence and make sure that the sound system was working for their big event i ended up doing a mic check at least or times i thought nothing could be more satisfying than the look of frustration on his face but i was wrong i watched the coverage turns out they covered the event but completely didnt use the interview
i was ignored by all of the deli clerks this morning buying bologna they each stared at me for a few minutes like i was an animal in the zoo and went about their morning rituals after she saw that i wouldnt leave the manager waited on me i asked for a half pound she sliced off almost three quarters of a lb and asked me if that was alright i smiled like a big boy and told her no thanks ill just take the half pound 
so this happened back in middleschool i rode the bus to school and home every day and there were three girls who would constantly annoy and pick on my friend and me both of us were always taught to fully respect women so we just kind of dealt with it and did our best to ignore them eventually they started to throw trash and pencils at us and one day they brought a bag of doritos and actually began spitting chewedup doritos at us every now and then we would lash out at them and throw things back but it never did any good why they did this i dont know neither of us were ugly or weirdlooking and we were both pretty wellliked in school just a couple of average guys this had gone on for almost a year nobody ever paid any attention to it mentioned anything about it to them not even the bus driver who we literally sat right behind i never truly confronted them about it because i simply never wanted to talk to them and after a while it just sort of became background noise one of the girls had nice blonde hair that she was very proud of and spent a lot of money taking care of it and getting it styled the way she wanted it etc judging from what i had heard them talking about behind us ill call her butt one day my friend was out sick so i alone was the subject of their tortures we were on our way to school and she sat behind me once we got to her pickup spot butt had placed her hair in a ponytail with a red flower on the side of her head after greeting her friends popped up from her seat and spit on my head now they had spat at us before even fired halfchewed doritos but they had always missed this time it was directly dripping onto my head as if i was in some type of horror movie with the beast clinging to the ceiling and oozing its body fluids down my face at this point id had enough my patience with them had already been worn down needlethin and the ooze from her mouth dripping onto my face had broken something in me i didnt want to simply confront her i needed something better it was at that moment that i finally let the hatred flow through me and i looked all around the immediate area praying that i would find some kind of object or tool to exact my revenge not later that day not the next day but now and my prayers were answered underneath my seat there was a full unopened jar of vicks vaporub and a greasy paper plate with crumbs still stuck to it like an artist fueled by the madness burning inside of him i began to fingerpaint the jar all over the paper plate in between her spittings timing it so she wouldnt see what i was planning for her we were almost at school and time was running out i had to make sure that every last drop of that little jar full of revenge was smeared onto some part of the plate we started pulling up to the curb at school we had arrived late and the line of buses in front of us had already dropped off their loads of kids butt continued to pop up to let fly drops of spittle i had been timing it the entire ride almost every seconds i listened the sound of her popping up to spit made a slight sound that crinklingtype sound when you sit on a leather seat and it sticks to you i was ready i heard her start to stand and like greased lightning on fastforward i turned and pied that bitch right in the forehead with an entire jar of strategicallyplaced vicks i smeared it all in her hair around her ears making sure to get it on the back of her head as well the bus stopped and the doors opened i stood up dropped the plate on the floor of the bus and glanced at her she had a look of shock and horror on her face her hands running through the blue glazed glob covering her hair she began to cry i turned without saying a word and walked off the bus basking in the howls of laughter coming from the rest of the kids on the bus directed at her her friends had their hands covering their mouths unable to believe what had just happened class started in minutes they never bothered me or my friend again and no longer did butt ride my bus to school edit grammar thanks stoleyourcomment and others i is appreciated it

sallie mae has been calling me pretty ruthlessly looking for my ex i guess he listed me as a reference when he applied for student loans years after we split i kept telling them to not call me about him take me off his account they said they couldnt because im a reference anyway i guess they skip traced me got my mailing address from my personal account with them and sent me a sheet to fill out looking for my ex they did not send a business reply envelope i wrote on the sheet the city he lives in and that they are only allowed to contact me in regards to him if they find him because he owes me money too that i cannot be his reference because i didnt sign anything and wouldnt have referred him then i constructed an envelope out of tape and scrap paper put their address as both the return address and mailing address and mailed it postage due so they can pay their own cents for it
yesterday while in line at a grocery store i was the unfortunate witness to a horrible child and the worst momhuman ive seen in awhile this rather large woman had already paid for her groceries but was still bagging them this is one of those bagityourself places there are two conveyors so two customers can bag their stuff simultaneously my stuff is getting checked out and placed on the conveyor i decide to just wait until she is done bagging since she is blocking my way out as well as my conveyor i blame this mostly on the store for poor layout design but i know it can still work if both people put in a little effort to be courteous so the store doesnt take all the blame there meanwhile her kid is running around and screaming and she doesnt even seem to notice it is slightly annoying but ive seen worse i continue standing there making idle chitchat with the cashier and the lady behind me then all of a sudden i see the conveyor with my items moving and look over to see the kid holding the conveyor button the cashier was quick to tell him to stop or he would crush my food the kid didnt listen and the mom still didnt seem to notice again the cashier said it more firmly for him to stop still nothing the cashier says maam can you please stop him the mother looks up looks at her kid and says danny stop it and then continued ignoring the fact that he didnt listen finally my food hit the end and the cashier grabbed little dannys hand off the conveyor button and made him go around to the other side of his moms cart she then picked up my eggs and bread and without looking away from the mom she said danny squished your bread and eggs to me the mom still seemed oblivious i mean this was an oblivious that i have never seen before fortunately another employee also noticed and grabbed me a new loaf of bread and eggs very quickly since the line was forming behind me the woman and her kid left as i finished paying and i packed up my stuff quickly i walk out into the exit area to my delight the horrible mom and her devil child danny are still there the mom is standing to the side talking on her cell phone danny is screaming that he wants to get in the cart and wants his moms help he may as well be a mute with the attention his mom is giving him i stopped between them as i was leaving i turned to danny and said that if he climbs onto the bench beside his cart that he can jump onto it his eyes lit up i zipped up my jacket while providing a little interference so his mom wouldnt see it didnt matter she didnt turn towards him the entire time i look at danny and he is on the bench and then bammm he jumps and lands right in the middle of the cart on the groceries he wiggles himself up to the child seat area while crushing everything in his way i smile and proceed to walk out before the sliding doors close behind me i hear his mom scream what have you done tldr the power of paying attention 
so i got this new number about months ago and i keep getting calls for the guy who had the number before me juan must have never paid his bills because he got about calls a day from collection agencies i would say sorry man you got the wrong number please remove this number but they kept calling after about a month i would get upset and start asking for their manager but they would just hang up and keep calling back so i decided i was tired of it next time there was a call me hello them i need to speak with juan me great who am i speaking with them this is suzy with xyz finanical corp me fantastic are you calling for yourself or for someone else them im calling for juan me super if you dont mind me asking who long have you been thinking of purchasing a widget whatever i could think of at that time from our company them i need to speak with juan me i understand its a family decision suzy how long have you and juan been married them juan is not my husband i was calling me then why are you allowing him to make this important widget decision for you them no im calling because me let me explain some of the benefits our product has to offer at this point they would try to talk over me but i would continue in talk about the product i had mentioned essentially i was being an obnoxious telemarketing salesperson guess what they fucking hated it i just kept going until they hung up sometimes i would call the number back and act like we got disconnected me is suzy there they put me through to suzys line them hello me hello suzy we must have gotten disconnected now where was i oh yes widgets are until they hung up again and again suzy we must have a bad connection we keep getting disconnected it didnt stop all the calls but it did cut them down about a day then i started a whole new thing me hello them i need to speak with juan me yes this is hiddenonion how can i help you them i need to speak with juan me who may i say is calling them this is xyz money corp me oh yes this is about the financing right them well i can only talk to juan me what is this a joke them no i need to speak to juan me i am the executor of his will and i am handling all the financing for his funeral it is in poor taste to make jokes like that im glad his mother didnt answer the phone you son of a bitch them juan has pasted away me why do you think we financed a funeral through you sons of bitches im yelling at this point are you retarded or just stupid them sir there is not need for that me i agree why would you call asking for juan when you know good and well hes dead because we are financing his funeral with you guys them sir we dont finance funerals we are me what the hell are you talking about so you are not going to pay his funeral even though you already approved it the day before hes to be buried the funeral home has to be paid upfront if we dont then they hold the body whats your name it would go on back and forth for a while until they hung up and never called back no more calls but i kind of wish they did because i so more many scenarios i could play out for juans life edit some people asked how i remember the conversation because i used to do telemarketing for years and had to memorize the script so i just used that same script the funeral one i remember because it gave me so much satisfaction 
years ago i was in the army as a private i was an enothing so i had no rank and even less authority so i was on convoy with this sergeant an e that had some chip on his shoulder for several notverygood reasons but he outranked me so i did what he said the convoy was at homestation and it was simply moving equipment from one part of the post to another it wasnt a combat convoy and there was no traffic to worry about the problem was the guy was a dick at that time i was going through some rough times at home my wife had severe medical problems and we just had a baby so naturally i was tired as hell while we were driving i nodded off i tried i really did but missing so many nights of sleep took its toll he slammed on the brakes and proceeded to chew me out for falling asleep fine i can take it but he decides that its not going to end there when we got to our destination he gave me another asschewing and had me doing pushups to the point of muscle failure okay maybe a little overboard but it wasnt my place to argue and after all i did fall asleep so i took it let him do what he wanted and moved on but he wasnt done every time he saw me after that he found or manufactured a reason to smoke me in the same way one time it was because i looked at him funny he had this way of drawing out the words you looking at me funny private one time because i didnt look at him at all apparently ignoring him sometimes it was just because he thought i needed extra pt i tried to avoid him but he always managed to find me and then one day one glorious day he left the unit moved on went somewhere else i was free i moved on and moved up got promoted a few times until i had my own stripes i was in the transportation corps we got blown up a lot so promotions happened pretty rapidly one of the duties of an nco sergeant or above on the enlisted side is to do whats called staff duty its a hour duty where you sit in an office and answer phones go to the clubs during closing to make sure no ones trying to drive drunk checking doors etc you have a runner to help you out but you also get some of the troublemakers the people that have gotten in trouble and gotten extra duty as part of their punishment while i was getting briefed they warned me about one in particular he had gotten busted down a few times for hitting his wife and attacking the mps military police the second time they came out to break up a fight maybe not everywhere but my unit didnt take very kindly to spousal abuse and the other soldiers tended to take it upon themselves to make sure the abusers learn their lesson and then he walks in yup that former sergeant was now a private just like i was those tables had turned i wish i could say that i took the high road and maintained my bearing as a professional but all that time of being hunted by this man came back to me i probably could have let that go if he hadnt beat up his wife id met her she was a sweet tiny little thing that didnt deserve what he did to her twice sure he got busted down in rank but i felt that she deserved a little bit of petty revenge which she probably couldnt get on her own our eyes met he remembered me he saw my rank and his eyes opened wide i smiled you looking at me funny private
this happened about years ago or so i had moved to a new city that had reached the point where it was running out of phone numbers left in one of its area codes but was resisting adding a new one so when i got my new land line phone number i was reissued the phone number of somebody who had recently canceled their service this was precell phone and broadband wasnt available in the area yet so a land line was necessary from the day the phone was hooked up i started getting phone calls for bob the previous owner of the number apparently bob didnt bother to tell anybody that he had moved and bob was a really popular guy friends family business calls you name it from early morning until late at night i was getting calls for bob i would get home from work and the answer machine shut up it was the s would have a half a dozen messages left for bob for the first couple of months i would patiently explain to each caller no bob doesnt live here no i dont know bob no i dont know his new number no i dont know where he moved to no i cant get a message to him i would go through this process as much as a dozen times a day on some days i figured that eventually i would have talked to every person bob knew and the calls would stop unfortunately they didnt i finally had enough i changed the message on my answering machine to say and if you are calling for bob bob is dead please stop calling for him i also started giving that same message every time i answered a call for bob bob is dead i dont know any details please dont call here again surprisingly it only took about weeks before i came home from work to find an answering machine message this is bob i am not dead please stop telling people that i am dead ltclickgt i laughed i did not change my answering machine message immediately after this bob must have finally taken the initiative to start giving his new phone number to people because over the next week or two the calls for him started tapering off to the point that i only got one call for him every month or so i still told those callers that bob was dead though
this morning on my way to work some guy cut off the car behind me without using turn signals and then proceeded to tailgate me flashing his lights and waving his arms around in exasperation i was going the speed limit in the far right hand lane and there was plenty of room to go around me if he wanted to go over the speed limit he eventually pulls to the left to try and pass me and as hes speeding up he flips me off so i started speeding up and slowing down just enough so that he couldnt pass me or go behind me and continued this for the next three or four exits until as fate would have it i saw a police car ahead on the shoulder and resumed normal speed he took that opportunity to speed up to an ungodly speed and merge in front of me with no turn signal only to get pulled over by the cop i saw ahead knowing our local law enforcement he probably walked away with at least in traffic fines mmm nothing like petty revenge first thing in the morning lt edit oh my god this is the best day ever he just came in to hire my boss to represent him on his ticket i was in our reception area grabbing files to take to court and he was in there finishing up the hiring process with one of our secretaries he saw me as i was leaving and went white i gave him a little smile and wave and left he caught up with me as i was walking to my car and apologized for flipping me off grinned sheepishly and admitted that he deserved the ticket i apologized for trolling him we laughed about it and shook hands and he left he was actually pretty nice and seemed kind of embarrassed xd edit holy crap over upvotes dang i dont have time to keep up with all the comments on this anymore due to work constraints so ill put additional info here yes we did actually recognize each other there was definite eye contact and some laughing on my part when all of this went down i have a pretty good eye for detail and can remember faces easily he probably recognized me because i have very distinctive red hair its not a very big coincidence at all for him to hire my boss since i work for a popular law firm in my area pretty much everyone hires my boss for tickets etc my max speed was over the limit low speed under very minor fluctuations in speed done in low traffic you can argue reckless driving or caution me to be more careful but this was a rare thing for me to do and at no time did i feel any indication of danger or i would not have done it yes i know i acted like a child haha but this is the petty revenge subreddit after all this is not a habit of mine i tend to ignore asshole drivers for the most part but didnt this time usually i just give dbag drivers the why gesture with my hands when stuff like this happens at any rate im glad people enjoyed this as much as i did it certainly made my day lol
arrived at the volleyball tournament and tried to find parking in a completely full parking lot pretty typical of tournaments so not a big surprise drove around for a few minutes to make sure i didnt miss an open spot i didnt it really was full when i found a bigass truck parked right in the middle of two spots in the back yes these parking spots are big enough to accommodate even this tiny dick compensator but he takes two anyway anyone going to these things knows parking is or will become scarce so in order to do this he arrived early and boggarted two separate spots so his big shiny rig wouldnt be at risk dont idiots like this know that behavior of this nature is what puts their shit at risk dumbass my petty revenge i left an anonymous note on the windshield that said sorry didnt mean to scratch your truck i left with a big smile on my face thinking about how hed be searching every square inch of his truck for a scratch that wasnt there tldr asshole takes in a crowded parking lot probably spends minutes looking for a nonexistent scratch 
yesterday i was flying to florida on a fairly cramped airplane im nearly so planes are generally terrible for me but this one seemed more cramped than usual and to compound the issue the person in front of me put their seat back as soon as they could after takeoff and didnt put it back up until we were descending into orlando i needed more space but i know how crappy it is when the douche in front of you puts their seat all the way back so out of kindness to the person behind me i only reclined my seat a little bit just enough to take the edge off of feeling like i was in a straitjacket apparently this was unacceptable to the jerk behind me because within a few minutes of putting my seat back they started pushing it all the way back up i pushed really hard back and they pushed back even more so i thought screw it i tried to be nice but im done and fully reclined my chair which locked it into place when they tried pushing it back up it would only move about an inch to an inch and a half and id push right back and just because im a petty dick every so often id put it all the way back up to make them think they had room again before quickly reclining again

years ago i worked in the engineering department of a tech company there was one supervisor there who was a real ass he was pompous and if he saw you typing something he would walk by and press a bunch of keys to screw you up or if you were scanning something he would lift the scanner top and put his hand or face on it it annoyed everyone but he was in a position of power so nobody called him out on it one day i had had enough we used windows nt workstations and i had found out the password to the computer in his cubicle i came back early from lunch logged into his computer and changed the directional orientation of the mouse i reversed it so if you pushed the mouse up the arrow went down you push left it goes right when he gets back from lunch he logs in and is stumped by this he reboots asks a few people around him for help then throws a tantrum like a little kid because he has to call tech support when they arrive it takes them minutes to fix he is sure it is a computer issue and they treat him like he is an idiot i did this to him once a week for the next month the amazing part was that he would be so busy throwing a fit he never watched tech support to find out how to fix it he was sure it was a computer problem and wanted a new computer but instead they just had him change his password since i didnt know the new password my fun was over once the password was changed he realized it was someone doing it on purpose at our next staff meeting he told the head of the department that he wanted a full investigation into this and that person to be fired i was crapping myself until the department head said to him rich you walk around here proclaiming yourself the nt master and you got owned by a simple mouse trick i would be so embarrassed that i would just keep quiet and hope people forget about it the entire room laughed at him and i felt a wave of satisfaction wash over me edit well this unexpectedly blew up just to clarify because i have had a few people ask my supervisor was an engineer he also called himself the nt master if you had a problem he would always say dont worry the nt master is here to help
i have a remote rural property where i plan to build a cabin someday in the meantime my family and i camp there as much as possible since we love it out there creek nearby rolling hills that used to be ditchirrigated pasture gorgeous view and pretty much nobody around one of the few people for miles is the ditch rider that operates a transmountain water diversion structure farther up the creek owned by the company that bought the water rights my property had before the previous owner sold it i had met the ditch rider once before he was gruff at first but as i curiously questioned him about his work he opened up a little bit ok enough backstory one friday evening my family and i arrived to camp out only to find a group of kids in their late teens in the upper field pickup trucks circle of tents and large bonfire i drove by them on the dirt road and it looked like they were having a pretty chill gettogether i didnt mind so much that they were trespassing but we were in a stage ii fire ban so having a fire was a big deal here in colorado it doesnt take much for a fire to spread and before you know it thousands of acres are scorched so i parked my vehicle at our building site left my wife and daughter there and went up to talk to them map in hand i pointed out that this was private property and showed them some of my favorite camping spots in the nearby national forest and blm but since they had already set up camp they could stay where they were for the weekend i made the offer that if they wanted to come back in the future they could if they just asked me beforehand not a bad deal i thought however i told them that we were in a stage ii fire ban and flame including campfires and smoking outdoors was absolutely prohibited i asked that they put out the fire immediately and they did as i was walking away i heard one of them say fucker thinks he owns the place and they all laughed i was a little offended considering how i could have easily told them to gtfo but whatever you know how male teens can be when trying to impress a group lo and behold an hour later when i walk back up to check on them theres a bonfire twice as big as the first one a fuck you to me and more importantly a massive middle finger to the wellbeing of the entire region i decide i need to teach these little shits a lesson i devised a perfect plan remember when i said that this used to be ditchirrigated pasture all the old water structures were still in place and in pretty good condition only problem was i didnt have a water right so i drove up to the ditchriders cabin and he remembered me from when we had met i dont think he gets a lot of visitors i explained the situation and his rough exterior turned to outright glee as came up with the same plan i had together we shut his companys headgate by about half allowing a surge of water to flow downstream and then drove down to the headgate of my old ditch and opened it fully from the dirt road on the ridge above we watched as the water crept across the field soaked their tents and presumably their sleeping gear and drowned the fire with a steaming hiss a mad scramble ensued as they hastily loaded up their gear and drove away well one got stuck in the soggy field for a few minutes and needed to get pulled out as they passed us on the dirt road out i get a nasty look from the guy who had so indiscreetly told me off i chuckled to myself its not like i own the place tldr trespassing teens camp in my field i try to be nice they respond by having a huge fire during a burn ban and i with the help of a crotchety old ditch rider flood the field my witty oneliner is heard by no one and isnt really that great
after riding public transportation my whole life i can say without a doubt that there are a lot of occurrences of rude people on the bus i hopped on a bus after class one afternoon to find it packed as usual luckily i found an empty seat next to a large woman i sit and immediately after she repeatedly made huffing noises started rolling her eyes and then moved the bags she had on her lap to be practically sitting in my lap now i am a very thin girl and always sit at the edge of my seat to avoid awkward skin contact but she was making it very obvious she was trying to scoot me out well i wasnt about to stand up on that cramped bus so i waited it out until i got to my stop to get up i saw a very large older lady a few people up the aisle from me and got her attention i told her she could have my seat and she was very happy when she sat down with her two large reusable shopping bags overlapping herself on the other woman i smirked and the rude ladys jaw dropped she gasped and just sat there quiet oh i was just dying inside i made a lady happy while getting back at that rude woman d

normally it doesnt bother me so much but in one particular instance it pissed me off because it had hurt my reputation at my job as a tutor he had said that i as a huge stoner in case youre curious anyways i was pissed off and i dont live with my parents anymore but he does so in the middle of the night i let myself in the back door grabbed the spare key to the car and turned it on he loves country music dearly and i hate it so i changed every preset station on his radio to mariachi music and turned the volume up all the way turned off the car put the key back and went home i warned my other younger brother who typically drives to school with him to watch out he said it was pretty funny after furiously hitting every single preset on fm and fm he just turned the radio off

the main floor of my apartment building had a small common area where the mailboxes and bulletin board were one day i came downstairs to find a shitty old black couch sitting in front of the mailboxes it was taking up most of the area and if anyone had to move large items in theyd have to move that couch out first initially there was a handwritten note taped to it that said leather couch for sale for call xxxxxxxxxx after a few days the sign vanished but the couch remained for a few days then one week then another about a month later i walked downstairs in a really bad mood the couch was still there then the idea came to me i snapped a few pics with my phone and a few minutes later i was finishing up the text in my craigslist submission leather couch for sale read my new post replies came in quickly within twenty minutes i had arranged for a woman to come by and pick up the nasty old thing i helped her carry it out to her truck even helped her tie it down she waved to me as she slowly drove off as i stood there richer and having turned my initially crappy day into a pretty good one tldr neighbor abandons furniture in apartment hallway so i sell it and pocket the cash
so i had to relive myself during class so i asked to be excused to the restroom and was granted such note this particular restroom is quite small and contains no windows i walk in and realize that the stall has no toilet paper left well thats gonna suck for someone i thought to my self i then proceed to piss and lo and behold who comes in but the guy who loves to give me crap ha look at this its the kid who has no friends he pushed me a bit and snickered i just stood there taking it he went into the stall and began crapping i washed my hands and then stood still youre still in here are you gay or something i said nothing i realized he was situated in the bathroom and at the point of no return so i walked out and hit the light switch leaving him in the pitch black bathroom with no toilet paper i heard him yell but i kept walking down the hall big smile on my face and never looked back 
last week i went on a school trip for a week and stayed at a hotel on the th floor with a couple of girls this one group was constantly bitching and whining about everything and everyone complaining when something didnt go their way one day as i was about to head down to the lobby i see the group of girls waiting by the elevator of course they were complaining about how long it was taking i not wanting to socialize with them decided to take the stairs on my way down i pressed the elevator button on each floor so it would take even longer for them to reach the lobby it felt good when i got to the breakfast line seconds before they did my eggs never tasted so delicious

i used to work at comcast as a tier tech support rep dont hate me sometimes in tech wed get overflow from billing which i didnt mind because billing was usually just taking payments and it brought my call time down my phone rings god dammit turn mah tv back on immediate yelling she had an accent and she was hollering so it was a challenge to understand her technically because she cursed i could have told her to call back when she was calmer and then hung up but i like helping people so a bit of swearing doesnt phase me her service was temporarily disconnected because she didnt pay her bill for months funny thing was that she just had her service installed months ago so she hadnt paid a dime up to this point after verifying her information i let her know how much she would have to pay to get her service back on i let her know that once she paid her service would be back on in minutes im not gonna pay fucking anythang yer gonna turn my tv back on right fucking now i let her know again that if she paid for the last month and a half her service would be turned back on automatically in minutes and that there was no way i could turn it back on again manually youre stupid arent you can you hear me stupid fucking bitch turn my fucking tv back on once you make it personal you curse at me you call me names is when i get petty okay let me see what i can do would you mind holding for a moment i placed her on hold without waiting for a reply i researched everything about her her address her history in minute detail and found a long chain of fraud so i had her red flag disconnected which means that she cannot get any service at her address at all until she pays her entire bill in full and it even follows her if she moves after i was done scheduling the tech to go out to her house to cut her wiring i got back on the phone and let her know that unless she paid all of her bills in full she would not be getting any service ever again she yelled at me and called me notsonice names some more but at this point i really didnt care anymore since i already got my revenge and she hung up tldr i wouldnt have found out about her scheme if she hadnt called me a bitch
i stock shelves overnight at a grocery store its normally pretty relaxing work but lately theres been a lot of construction and things have been chaotic today was no exception as one of my aisles was packed very tightly with people trying to reset all the prices everyone was being polite and working around each other except for this one lady who demanded to know why i had taken the stool she was using i calmly said i didnt know you were using it and i guess i figured even if it was being used we could share i mean everyone else is sharing them she scoffed back yeah well im gonna have to null that then she laughed at me and snatched it back about minutes later i moved a loader of stock into the aisle and the lady freaked out and demanded that i move it because it was in her way i remained calm and said normally i would but now im gonna have to null it then i ignored her and kept working as she tried to work around me huffing and puffing the whole time like she thought she was the big bad wolf the look on her face as i spat her bullshit back at her was perfect and she continued to look like a dumb asshole as other members of her crew offered to share their stools with me
setting up the background of the story i was at a youthful age of and living on a military base in germany this all started from my very uncharismatic mother of course young kids pick up words they hear frequently i happened to learn the mighty unweilded power of the f bomb one day my mom and i were talking and i dropped it the first thing she did was grab my arm drag me into the kitchen grab some liquid dish soap and proceed to wash my mouth out now i was only years old but i was not about to be punished for repeating a word i learned directly from the hand that feeds getting my mouth washed out was not a pleasant experience and i learned nothing from her punishment as the night progressed i was pretty damn bitter about what happened earlier that night my mom was on the phone talking to my grandparents she usually had a glass soley for drinking water out of one thing i figured out is that when she takes a drink she is a chugger and not a sipper so being the nice guy that i am i offered to refill her empty water glass because she was busy on the phone this is my favorite part i had every intention at getting even with her i refill her water glass after it is full i take the bottle of dish soap and squeeze a shit ton into the glass itself i waiting to put soap in last to avoid sudding i gave the cup to my mom of course she is super chatty and looked thirsty i could tell by how parched her lips were she was pretty much salivating over that cold refreshing glass of water as i entered the room sure enough she took it from me and proceeded to chuch then wait the dynamic in the room changed and time came to a halt the water glass slowly released from her hand as gravity did gods work on its course to the shaggy carpet absolute disgues spread across her face i could feel her anger she grabbed me up so fast and started whooping me i didnt care though no spanking could erase that smug smirk from my face that was the first and last time mouth wash with soap ever happened in the house they say revenge is a dish best served cold i say revenge is soap hidden for consumption and that was the day my mom learned soap is not food

i work as a bartender and sometimes guests are plain dicks this guy ticked all the boxes no answer to my greeting barely talking mostly grunting to order something or waving his half empty glass in my direction i know i know we service folk arent really people and dont deserve the use of words but if you behave like a dick dont expect to be treated nicely so this guy just ordered a new beer and i made him one and the drafting gods had a very good day because it was the stunning image of a wonderful pilsner he is sitting at the bar right in front of me so i serve him is drink with a happy bitteschn maybe my jollyness offended him or he just wants to be an ass but he grunts in my general direction and shows me his glass and yes he was right the beer was a tiny bit under the measuring line and tiny means one or two millimeters at most considering that the beer had a beautiful crown of foam about two fingers wide high over the top of the glass thats a ridiculous complaint but of course i live to serve so i took his beer with a smile and placed it on my side of the counter but still right in front of him while i finished another order when i came back the foam reached the top of the glass but not higher and the beer was hitting the measuring line exactly i gave it back to him with a smile bitteschn i said again and he just stared at me but he didnt complain for the rest of the evening 
to start off the revenge was entirely unintentional but it worked really well also a little back story for the past weeks i have had an almost constant migraine and nausea i was driving home from work and started to feel like i had to throw up this is possibly the worst thing that could happen while driving besides crashing i went to pull into a car bay so i could run to the bin on the side of the road i wasnt very happy about having to degrade myself to throwing up into a public bin this asshole driver decided that instead of allowing me to pull in they would race in and take my spot i then had to circle around the parking lot to find a vacant spot all while needing to throw up eventually i ended up where i had started but this time there was a vacant spot next to asshole driver i pulled in got out and it was as i opened my door that i got a sudden urge to projectile vomit everywhere assholes car was covered in my spew i drove off and made it home before needing to throw up again 
i posted this as a response to a post from a disgruntled pizza delivery guy who got stiffed on a tip and a kind redditor said it it was good enough to be its own post so here it is my first ever self initiated reddit thread when people used to do this to me mid s in college i would make a point of giving them back their change the secret is to act totally cool with them being cheap bastards cbs pizza guy pg thatll be cb hands over pg takes money quickly confirms the customer is a cb and this is important immediately reaches into his pocket for change while keeping a pleasant friendly expression cb keep the change pg no thats ok now heres some pro tips youve got to keep eye contact as much as possible so that cb wont mistakenly think he is in control of the interaction and just close the door also youve got to be friendly and seemingly unaware of what a douche cb really is last count the change out slowly enough to stretch out the painfully awkward social interaction for cb but not slowly enough that its obvious youre not totally sincere then finish the exchange with a cheerfull thanks alot enjoy your pizza to finish the ultimate passiveaggressive revenge next time they order when you get out to the car remove the pizza from the hot bag and put it in the back seat with the windows open this works best in january i delivered pizzas for three years in college there was one thieving little bastard tlb whose mother would send him to the door every time it was obvious that he was stealing my tip say the bill was hed show up to the door with a twenty and three ones and hand me the twenty and of course keep the change after this happened like three times i realized that he was too clueless to realize how much my change counting routine was burning him so the next time they ordered he came to the door i gave him the pizza he stole my tip and i said did your mom call in this order tlb yeah why me theres a note on the order that the customer wanted a receipt so i filled out a receipt that i made on my computer subtotal tip a big ass zero order total the look on his tlb face was priceless and apparently he totally bought it and felt compelled to hand his mom the receipt because she called the store before i even got back and asked if i could stop back on my next run so he could apologize and she could give me my tip victory
our next door neighbour is your typical keeping up with the joneses type we get a paved driveway he gets a paved driveway we get an extension to our bottom floor he gets one to his top floor because his bottom floor already has one we talk about putting a victorianstyle streetlamp in our garden he gets two victorianstyle streetlamps in his you get the picture recently we applied for planning permission which was granted to convert our garage into another room so we went round to our neighbours as a courtesy to let him know our plans and when things would be getting started lo and behold the week after he comes round with a smug ass look on his face and tells us hes having some work done on the front of our house and what do you know the start date is the same as the one we told him that is a problem as space is at a premium as we live on a culdesac and our road cant handle major pieces of work being done at the same time we let him start on his first and begin when he finishes his own work so we go round again to let him know work is about to begin and our neighbour completely changes his tune on the issue now he decides that he cant cope with the noise and disruption due to his old age and in no uncertain terms lets us know that should we go ahead with our plans then he will do his upmost to have them scuppered were completely baffled as this man has literally just finished a week project on his own house which was incredibly noisy throughout i like to think im a cool guy but i dont like people making vague threats at me particular snooty old men with twigs up their backsides and nothing better to do than complain all day so i did what any caring neighbour would do helped him out i found all the ads and websites i could about hearing aids loft insulation showerlifts stairlifts assisted living hearing aids incontinence aids meal services how to deal with dementia cruises you name it and i signed the fucker up brochures flyers and trials of every single one of them i heard him in his garden the other day shouting at his wife telling her that no matter how much she suggested he doesnt fucking need incontincence pads at his age tldr old age turning you into a sour old lemon ill give you the ingredients to make it into lemonade motherfucker
i used to work at a large hospital i liked my alone time at lunch so i always parked on the top floor of the furthest parking structure on the opposite side of the elevator in order to eat my lunch and listen to my music lone rocker style mine was usually the only car in sight one day the parking structure elevator opened and i saw that my car was not alone as i got closer i saw that not only was there another car parked on this floor they parked in the spot right next to me and they parked so close as to prevent me from opening my door this has to be a jokethis is the most inconvenient place to park on this tenacre hospital campus and of the fifty empty spots this guy chose the one that screwed me over of all the actions i couldve taken im proud to have stayed petty i crawled in through the passenger side started my car and parked on the other side of this monster and you guessed it so close that he couldnt open his door 
so today i was taking the bus to the train station so when i got on this woman was sitting in one of those seats that have seats facing her like opposite her and facing her the thing is she was putting her feet on those seats and the bus was pretty crowded so i asked her if i could sit down and she begrudgingly put her feet down fast forward minutes and she has her feet up again not touching me but really fucking close to my legs its worth mentioning that at this point the bus was at the kind of stop where many people get off and many new people get on seeing as i already gave her a chance to not look like an asshole in public i did what any year old male wouldve done i waited till the bus was full again and i let out the most silent but deadly of farts the amazing thing is everyone on the bus around us smelled my fart and immediately looked at that woman and started whispering to each other and covering their noses im not sure if they thought she farted or her feet smelled bad or both but at least it made her embarrassed enough to put her legs down till the end of the journey edit holy shit this blew up thanks for the all replies edit for spelling and grammar 
i hadnt been on the job too long maybe a couple months when my lunch started getting stolen out of the break room fridge every other day management didnt seem to noticecare and nobody had a clue who the culprit was so i put my formidable investigative skills to the task they would not remain anonymous for long all their sins would be laid bare before the people okay a bit of hyperbole there im not nearly that sophisticated i made up a delicious spaghetti meal put it in a nondescript container and laced it with ipecac syrup it might taste slightly off to whoever ate it but it would still be edible enough i had no way of knowing when it would be taken so i let a few of my fellow hungry coworkers in on it it was too tempting for the thief to pass up and i deliberately left off any sort of identification as luck would have it i was about to come back in from a smoke break when a large walruslike black woman who worked in marketing lumbered out the door and promptly sprayed the slightlyused spaghetti on the ground for several of us to see i would like to say i had a badass witty oneliner to hit her with but all i could think of was so workplace buffet didnt agree with you eh edit for reference this took place about fifteen years ago edit holy crap there sure are a lot of armchair lawyers here for those who didnt read my first edit this is ancient history nothing of note happened afterward
i have been staying at various backpacker hostels for the last few months while looking for work in northern australia the hostel i had been staying in had big commercial fridges for the residents to put their food in in boxes with name tags and these were covered by security cameras there were plenty of signs reminding people of the cameras too so i wander in to the kitchen looking forward to my fingers of chocolate and wafer goodness and see my bright green food bag has changed shelves this isnt good i grab the bag and find a wrapper and half a finger left there is a hour window since i was last in the fridge so i go to the office and the manager checks the recording it takes a little bit of time but what do i see a drunk and stoned motherfker got the munchies at am the manager said he would be evicted next time she saw him it seems harsh but shit it was cents on sale
context im a college student and i live in a oneroom space with my roommate ive lived with my roommate for the better part of a year now we reroomed this year she cannot get up to save her life in the mornings or at least she cant when im there shes admitted that she got up just fine when i was gone for a week due to surgery this means shes been relying on me to wake her up unnecessarily i was already a little irked by the fact that a grown adult couldnt rely on an alarm but this really got under my skin the revenge ive started to wake her up with just enough time to rush out of the door she can still make it to class but theres no such thing as a peaceful morning for her anymore
this is going to be long but ive been dying to tell this story its about how i put a narcissistic woman in her place after being accused of stealing on facebook a few years ago i was involved in one of those swap and sell groups on facebook it was specifically for stayathome moms and mostly centered around trading and selling clothing toys etc it was an awesome resource because you could get things for your children at a very low price and often make new friends in the process there was one woman however that made the swap and sell group an unpleasant place well call her kathy in person all she ever talked about was herself specifically about how great she was she did the same for her kids she would also slip little hints in about how you or your children were inferior in some way for example she would say things like oh your childs soccer team came in third place last season my sons team came first but thats not very surprising considering how good he is i must have done a great job raising him and its a shame that others cant do the same with their children she really would say things like that in hindsight she was a narcissist im not just saying that im pretty sure she could be diagnosed i just did the best i could to avoid her if i saw her in the next aisle of a store one day she saw me with my infant son he was crying so she came over and said oh let me hold him i can get him to calm down it was infuriating almost everyone hated her but kathy really took it to the next level when it came to the swap and sell she would be the first in line to buy something only to demand a lower price upon inspection these clothes look dirtier than what i saw in the picture i will only pay half she did this crap all the time and if the seller didnt oblige she posted a rant about how they screwed her over never do business with them yada yada this sort of talk was technically against the rules of the swap and sell but kathy was friends with the administrator so nothing was ever done the administrator was lazy anyway and rarely interacted with the group furthermore kathy had a few cronies that would send pms to everyone in the group badmouthing sellers who didnt accpet kathys half price crap it was borderline blackmail i always felt some anxiety when i posted something for sale because i was afraid kathy would claim it first and then pull her scam which she did several times she had facebook hooked up to her phone and since she sat at home and did nothing all day she was fast to jump on items for sale oftentimes she would buy something and then it would appear for sale months later at a jacked up price what made this all the more frustrating was the fact that she was a pastors wife and had good standing in the community nobody knew what a bitch she was even though she was a toxic and selfish person who cared only about herself i put up with this woman for three years then one day i had had enough i listed a toy for sale it needed aa batteries to work knowing this i purchased a new pack of batteries and put them in the toy i tested it it worked i said that batteries were included in my listing everything seemed to be in order within two minutes kathy jumped in and said she wanted it she obviously saw it pop up on her phone while she was lounging around at home the rules said i had to offer it because it was first come first serve and i could not skip over buyers so with a heavy heart i set up a time to bring it to kathys house she refused to meet me halfway or come to my home as was her custom i dropped off the toy when i was in town running errands the next day kathy didnt try to pull the usual it looks dirtier than the pic scam so that was nice she asked if the batteries were included and i said yes i received payment and went about my day kathy was playing fair bout damn time but when i got home i had notifications on facebook kathy had tagged me in a post uh oh this couldnt be good in her post she claimed that there were no batteries she posted a pic of the empty battery slots shamed me for my shady sales tactics gave a little sob story about how her chubby year old soccer star was upset that he couldnt play with it and demanded her money back on top of this shitstorm one of my friends pmed me saying that people were receiving messages from kathys cronies about how selfish and shady i was that bitch i had never been more pissed and hurt in my life i was done putting up with this chicks shit i responded with a rather lengthy message calling her out on her scams in the past i said she was a liar for removing the batteries and that she should be ashamed of herself for behaving in such a manner when she was a pastors wife many people liked my comment and i knew that the shit was about to hit the fan but i didnt care anymore when i logged in to facebook the next day i had a ton of notifications and messages my stomach dropped i skimmed through the messages first some were positive thanking me for calling kathy out some were negative from kathys cronies about what a rude person i was to say those things about her as for the notifications most of them stemmed from a single post that had been stickied by the administrator in the swap and sell group apparently she overcame her laziness just long enough to publicly humiliate me the post said that thieves yes thieves were not tolerated in the group and then went on to mention me by name this was no small thing as there were many women involved in this group and we were in a small midwestern town where word traveled fast my reputation as a mother was being attacked the post went on to say that rather than banning me i had the opportunity to apologize and refund the money i owed the first comment to the post was from kathy she said something that no doubt she had been dying to say for a long time it went something like this sk youve stolen money from me and tried to blame your past actions on me as well and yet in the face of your accusations i have been patient and kind this peace comes from the lord if you would only accept him as your savior you would feel the same peace if nothing else this whole situation just proves that i am better than you over twenty people liked the comment holy fuck this shit had to stop kathy the narcissist was turning the tables and accusing me of actions which were actually hers an actual case of projection the time for vengeance had come the revenge this requires a bit of explaining you see kathy had a secret one that i stumbled on by accident several years prior while reading the local newspaper while doing errands in the next town over in one small corner regarding court happenings there was a column about a man who had killed his friend while high on bath salts i dont remember the exact details of the crime nor did i know what the nature of the court proceedings were but thanks to the column i did know that this man had been found mentally unfit to stand trial and sent to the state mental hospital and i did know the names of his parents who were present at the hearing the parents strangely enough had the exact same names as kathy and her husband i did some googling and discovered that this man was kathys oldest son kathy never mentioned having another son for obvious reasons this crime happened when kathy and her family were living in this other town soon after her son was sent to the mental ward kathy and her husband moved away to my town i knew that she had lived elsewhere before joining the swap and sell but i didnt know that she had moved to distance herself and her husband from their dark secret this was my short and sweet response to kathys comment i still remember it word for word kathy youve asked me to apologize for actions that were yours and then have the audacity to say that youre better than me but whats funny kathy is that the son you raised turned out to be a lunatic murderer i will always be better than you and i posted a link to the old news article i did not stick around to watch everything go down as i was sick of the drama i removed myself from the group and went about my day the aftermath i received a phone call from a close friend in the evening and i learned what had happened after i posted the link to the article about kathys son the comments section absolutely blew up kathy and her cronies posted several comments where the group administrator was tagged demanding that my comment be deleted my friend said that there were several posts like this and they started to sound pretty desperate near the end the lazy administrator of course was slow to respond kathy even said something about driving to the administrators house since she was not returning her phone calls after a couple of hours the whole swap and sell group was deleted but the damage was done as for what happened to kathy i never had the chance to find out as she deleted her facebook i saw her in the grocery store a few weeks later but she just flipped me off and walked the other way my friends and i founded a new swap and sell group it gets bigger every day but kathy is not a part of it
i work at a small hotel as front desk clerk last month we had a work crew staying with us as guests we have these fairly frequently men doing construction roadwork repairing pipelines etc and for the most part theyre decent hardworking guys sometimes a little rough around the edges but no real trouble this crew was the exception i dont know what pit of hell their boss had dug them up from but i and all my coworkers wished theyd go back they were loud crude and foulmouthed they took up all our smoking rooms and frequently smoked where they werent supposed to like the hall and stairwells so that other guests complained of the smell they were working somewhere with red clay and it seemed they had never been taught to wipe their boots before coming indoors so we were constantly sweeping and mopping up after them most work crews go to sleep early but this crew was hardpartying and would come in drunk and obnoxious at all hours of the night on more than one occasion scaring potential guests away from staying with us this is the story of how i got back at them im the only staff on the overnight shift so i also put the breakfast out our breakfast starts at am i time everything to be fresh hot and ready at six ive worked there two years and only been late once or twice when guests needed excess help in the middle of my preparations its the first week this crew stayed with us in the morning im in the kitchen working to get everything ready when i hear people behind me turn around to see four guys from the work crew getting coffee okay but suddenly hey you gonna put more coffee out or what what the i just put the pot out there how have only four guys managed to empty it so fast answer all of them have filled giant takeaway thermoses no problem i tell them the second coffee pot is brewing right now i take away the first pot to wash so i can refill it next theyve made a complete mess of the coffee station i mean im used to most of the guests acting like twoyearolds when it comes to spilling sugar and such but these guys also havent even bothered to put their creamer and sugar packets in the provided trash bin just left them strewn all over the counter as if to show deliberate contempt for me as i clean up after them and put out the other pot more crewmembers arrive the rest straggle in one by one after this about or in all theyre starting to look over the rest of the breakfast area one of them turns on the tv flipping from the local morning news channel we normally keep it on to a country music station and turning the volume to max i have to ask him to turn it down because guests are still sleeping in the rooms around us a few of the dry foods and the hot stuff is already out i microwave the eggs and sausage but i always put the biscuits in the warmer at so they can heat up perfectly and be ready at six its still minutes till six but these guys dont care they grab the paper plates and start filling up i havent yet put out the tongs used to grab the hot stuff but they just use the plastic utensils or their hands then they start complaining that the biscuits arent hot i explain that breakfast starts at six theres a big ol sign on the wall that says the same thing and its explained to every guest when they check in and i put the biscuits out early so they could get warm by six they accept this but one guy asks if he can use the microwave to warm his up i have to deny him because its a teensytiny kitchen and i cant work around him and everyone after him who wants to do the same thing to get the breakfast ready im starting to get anxious about finishing on time because theyre slowing me up i tell him no but add the reason and that hes welcome to use the one in his own room i try to say it in my nicest nonconfrontational customer service voice but after that the whole crew gets more annoying and nasty towards me they keep asking when im going to put this or that out hey can i get some milk for this cereal yet when can i make a waffle i just keep repeating that ill have everything out by six oclock as that is the start of breakfast the other thing they were doing was blocking me they would crowd around the whole breakfast counter each of them waiting and staring at the place where whatever it was they wanted to eat was supposed to go like idiots plates and forks in hand and there i would be behind them trying to put the food in place and having to say excuse me and could i get through here please again and again and again fucking annoying as hell and i swear some of them were doing it on purpose but i got that breakfast out on time finished at now id like to say here that i was more tolerant of them than i would otherwise have been because i assumed they had to leave for work early like or if any of them had told me beforehand that they needed breakfast early i would have happily made it earlier ive done it for other crews before but no one at all mentioned it they just showed up right after and acted mad at me that breakfast wasnt ready for them well after all that their fucking bus didnt leave until get this and the whole time they were hanging out in my breakfast area and lobby being obnoxious as hell their normal tone of voice seemed to be a hearty shout they were telling crude jokes and stories loudly their cell phones were all going off at top volume with various alarms or blowing up with phone calls from other crew members to make sure they were awake they very much enjoyed calling the crew members not yet in the lobby and yelling wake up at them all together the second day was very much like the first except i hadnt put any of the dry stuff cereal muffins bread etc out when they got downstairs i was hoping theyd learned breakfast was at six apparently they were hoping id learned to be ready for them earlieragain with no one asking me to do so no request from them or their boss who didnt eat with them no pleases or anything just showing up at and being rude and the mood was slightly nasty from the beginning this time i did microwave the muffins so they were hot right away again most of them behaved like pigs at a trough queuing up around whatever i put out and jostling each other to get at it so that it was difficult for me to put the other food out that needed to go next to it again their bus left at when my manager arrived at the end of my shift i told him about it not in a dosomethingaboutthis way more like in a funny storystress reliefbitching way he said even if they actually requested it not to make the breakfast any earlier because they were waking other guests with their shouting so the third day i was ready for them reports of their bad behavior elsewhere were starting to trickle in from other shifts so i didnt feel at all bad at what i was about to do i filled up everything dry very early got all the cold stuff ready in the refrigerator and at five oclock brought the warmer into the kitchen plugged it in there and proceeded to fill it up i took everything including the plates napkins and utensils off the breakfast counter and stacked it in the kitchen and i took the remote for the tv with me at am i sat down behind my front desk and waited at they trickled down the stairs and elevator i didnt get up or make any move to fix or put out breakfast i could sense them looking over at me wondering what was going on there were two pots of coffee so they filled up their cups and waited eventually they even sat down the guy who liked the country music channel came over and asked for the remote i politely told him my manager said we had to wait until six to turn on the tv because it was waking up other guests he went back to the breakfast area they were talking about me now is she gonna make us breakfast shes pissed we not gonna get any breakfast that lazy bitch at i got up and went over there they all got excited standing up and stretching ready to mob any food i put out but all i did was clean the coffee area and take one of the pots to rinse out and refill one man asked damn girl we get any breakfast this morning i smiled as i told him it will all be out by six oclock at exactly i started to put out the food it was all ready to go so all i had to do was run it out there quickly and i just said excuse me coming through quite loudly to the one or two guys who tried to stand in my way they couldnt get any food until i was done anyway because i put the plates napkins and silverware out at the very last minute at precisely am the finishing touch i turned the tv to the weather channel at medium volume and i took the remote back to the front desk with me two more days of that and they were trained not to come downstairs until six tldr can we build it yes we can 
so on the bus home from a long sunday shift last thing i need is some hyperactive sugared up kid screaming and fucking about but there he was anyway so as we approached a stop his mum tries to calm him down by saying press the bell so pressed that shit first kids not happy i laughed as they got off

so im asianamerican and i work in an asian restaurant ill have some mildly offensive customers occasionally but its not too bad for the most part since im in california yesterday i had a table of two come in for lunch an older white lady and gentleman and they order etc nothing out of the ordinary their friend enters and joins them about minutes into the meal he was also an older white man balding maybe in his late s again nothing out of the ordinary for some reason though he was under the impression that either a i had no idea that the english language existed or b that i was autistic or something he would talk reaaaalllyyy sloowwllyyyy like thiiiiissss with appropriate hand gestures to match the simple words he used in an apparent effort to not overwhelm my tiny inferior brain our conversation went something like this hi how are you doing would you like a bit more time with the menu or did you have any questions chiiiickeenn teriiiiyaaaakkiiii nooo onioooons ooookaaaay umm yeah sure thing can i get you anything to drink waaaaterr nooo iiiicceee as he makes a giant x with his arms oh well i put in his order and im trying to be friendly since the two other people at the table are regulars and theyve never been impolite to me his food comes out and he asks for a separate plate so he can move his food over to that again saying this all very slowly while making a plate shape with his hands i walk back to the server station while plotting my petty revenge and realize the greatest insult i could inflict i return with his plate but not without a small addition a fork i place down both in front of him and he looks at me speaking normally i didnt ask for a fork i smile at him and say oh i know just in case keep in mind that neither of his friends have forks and he is now the sole owner of silverware at the table the greatest possible shame for a white person at an asian restaurant disgusted by the lack of culture displayed by their companion the couple quickly fled the scene and cut all ties with their former friend swearing that they didnt know he was like that just kidding the couple finished their food and left after a bit of conversation leaving the man by himself he was actually pretty polite after that and spoke to me normally he left a decent tip too saying that he enjoyed the food as he left i like to think that we reached a mutual understanding and gained respect for one another small shots here and there but the war was ended with no casualties
background i work as a janitor in a popular european hotel chain in a nonenglish speaking country when i am taking care of a demanding or overly rude customer ill simply forget the language of the natives and force them to speak to me in english i speak the native language well enough anyway its funny to watch them get slightly frustrated while they stumble over their words while i harshly judge their grammar and pronunciation in my head it makes me feel less uncomfortable while helping them since they sound less serious and when they are satisfied ill tell them goodbye in their own language when i leave their room
so im driving home late at night around am this car full of bros comes up behind me with almost no separation nothing drives me more insane were in the curb lane i am eventually planning to make a right turn normally i would slow down speed up when he tries to pass then slow down again etcbut with them so close i didnt think that was a safe option im a fairly experienced driver but i was actually feeling a bit nervous so i sped up a little bit guy climbs right back up my ass now im pissed off so i speed up a little bit more up he comes eventually were doing kph over the limit i jump on the pedal and dive into the next lane what asshole couldnt see while trying to assfuck my car was the pylons blocking the lane he ate them these were the big monsters too of them hope his buddies never let him forget it
hello folks i bring a tale from the miserable world of being a tour guide lets drive in i used to be a tour guide at a drivethrough safari near my home town in ontario the whole premise of the park is for you to be the one caged in your own vehicle while you drive through the game reserves which are filled with anything from lions to baboons to rhinos our baboons were notorious for ripping shit off of peoples cars like wipers weather stripping spare tires even rv paneling so many opt for a fully guided and narrated tour for only a person i drove people around in a full sized airconditioned bus and gave them a fully narrated tour about the park and the animals they were seeing an awesome deal considering the amount of information i gave on each tour like any tour there were always rules the most important rule of all was to not stand up during the ride especially while i was driving this was a safety measure as i would often have to brake quickly for a stupid ostrich or some cheeky baboon and anyone standing up was prone to being thrown around a bit the tricky part is that sometimes animals appear on different sides of the bus so in their tour driven vacational fury people would feel the need to stand to get better pictures if the bus was half full i would have no problem with people switching sides when the bus was stopped against the rules but hey i want these people to have a good time but when the bus was packed to the brim i would have zero tolerance i dont need screaming kids running wild around the bus i always tried to make sure that both sides get ample opportunities for pictures when the bus is full so that everyone gets a fair tour the park was popular with the indian community for some reason and my particular tour that day was filled with them most of them are very courteous of the rules and i usually dont have a problem but on that day two young teenagers decided that they were going to be a problem there are total reserves and through the first two these two kids were standing up and running all over the bus i would stop and tell them to sit down which they would but once another animal came up they were up and running again it was a busy day and i was loosing my patience their parents were disinterested in the tour and didnt really give two shits about what was going on and people were getting annoyed that these kids were climbing over people to see the animals by the rd reserve mins into the tour i had publicly told them to sit or times and i was getting fed up as i was pulling into the rd reserve the kids were both standing up and leaning on the seat in front of them seats are school bus style and staring at me through my overhead mirror their cocky teeage eyes said what are you gonna do about it i decided to do something about it i announced that we would shortly be seeing the cheetahs after which the kids got up into the isle i decided that i was fed the fuck up so i slammed on my brakes kid stumbled rather violently onto his father while kid two fell and smacked his head on the floor of the bus sorry about that folks had a cheetah cross my path here that why we have to stay seated the kid who fell got up and sat down in his original seat and i stared at him with my smug look of yeah you better sit your ass down you little prick didnt stand up for the rest of the remaining minutes at the end of the tour i told the kid to have a nice day i hope he didnt edit stuff
i was driving from st louis to chicago it was midwinter there was slush all over the roads i was being careful a jeeplike car gets up behind me and starts blinding me with their high beams if youve made this trip you know as you get closer to chicago traffic gets intense speeds increase cars are more tightly packed someone wanting to go faster and blinding me in the process is just dangerous the thing is even after he gets around me he keeps slowing down to get behind me flash the high beans tailgate and generally make me nervous i had plenty of time to memorize his license plate with little else to do and just wanting to vent i posted his license plate to craigslist rants and raves with one line in the text you are an asshole to my surprise the actual owner of the car saw my post and contacted me turns out his brotherinlaw a general troublemaker had been driving the vehicle and after verifying some pertinent information ie the kind of car and drivers looks let me know that his brotherinlaw would be removed from his insurance by the end of the day and wouldnt be driving anywhere soon tldr a driver harasses me on the road i post his license plate to craigslist only to find the owner of the vehicle and give the driver a neerdowell brotherinlaw a dish best served cold 
tldr at the bottom situation so i just started college this summer and the roommate i got paired up with was fine for two weeks now he seems to have developed a habit of leaving his key in the room any time im there because ill just open the door for him on the inside i didnt mind the first few times until i realized he wasnt even trying to remember his key he was just using me as a doorman several times a day he expected me to stop whatever i was doing and go open the door for him because he couldnt be bothered with it i know its not a big deal but im usually in bed with a book or a laptop i dont want to rearrange myself once an hour for no reason and there is absolutely no reason for him not to carry his key its just a card that opens the door when he gets close and he wears cargo shorts everyday so its not lack of pockets to keep it in if he had simply asked do you mind opening the door for me all the time so i dont have to carry my key i would have said yes i would have been a little annoyed but i would have said yes revenge last night while he was out in the lobby i decided i was tired i turned my phone off got into bed and fell asleep im a fairly heavy sleeper so knocking on the door isnt going to be enough to wake me up and if you make too much noise the ra will get mad he had to stay out in the dorm hallway all night bonus he usually has an alarm every morning to wake him up at the really annoying iphone emergency one that goes dah dah dah like theres a fire he leaves it on for up to twenty minutes because hes too lazy to turn it off despite the fact that he is right next to it today was the first day in the last month i got to sleep past am which is a ton of sleep because i went to bed before tldr roommate expects me to open the door for him because hes too lazy to carry his key i let him sleep in the hall
the guy next to me on my flight kept polluting the cabin with his shit vapors when the lady across the aisle tried to confront him he pretended not to speak either english or spanish despite having had a lengthy conversation with the flight attendants in both so when i got up to put my laptop back in my bag i gassed himin the face

i was making a quick run to the grocery store and parking was a nightmare the parking lot is composed of several one way aisles with only enough room for a car to drive down with feet of room on either side i pull into the lane directly in front of the entrance and this disgusting excuse for a human being is walking down the middle of the aisle this forces me to slowly creep behind her for about a third of the lane halfway to her car she has the nerve to look back at me and smile before turning around and continuing to walk in the middle of the aisle that bitch she finally gets to her car and i manage to find a parking space in the very back it must have taken her quite a while to load all of her groceries because by the time i had parked and walked up the aisle she was just pulling out of her parking space suddenly i couldnt remember if i had locked my car or not well i better check so i promptly turned right around and proceeded to slowly walk down the middle of the aisle to my car at the end of the row guess who was creeping behind me screaming the entire time to top it all off i actually did lock my car i guess that walk back was for nothing at all oh well better safe than sorry
i used to take my water bottle when i used their little gym now i use their water and their little plastic cups these fees are making me thirsty
so at work i drive around in a pickup truck with another guy ive never liked him much at lunch time we usually find someplace to park and eat our lunch now when i drive i usually try to find a nice shady place to park so the sun isnt shining through on us because thats just really annoying and its hard to see your phone screen with the glare well he is driving today and what does he do parks in the middle of a parking lot at an angle so that the sun comes through my window and not through his i pull my window shade down doesnt reach far enough i ask him nicely if he can pull up a few inches he literally says no because its not in my face does he think im lying whatever ill avoid confrontation and hang my hat off the shade to get a few more inches the sun is off my face but still bouncing off my phone screen out of the corner of my eye i can see that the glare from my screen is hitting him right in the face perfect as im typing this i can see its severely irritating him because he keeps looking over and trying to readjust but i just adjust the angle im holding the phone its really lighting him up too because hes wearing an ansi certified reflective shirt haha you make me suffer so will you tldr coworker park truck so sun in my face while eating lunch he wont move so i shine glare from phone screen in his face whole time he dont like so petty
so i was at kmart a few years back and roll into the parking lot as i get out i notice a woman blathering on her phone about something as she leaves her shopping cart in an empty parking space now two spots away there is a cart return but she just couldnt be bothered instead that cart will not take up a parking space until it is returned to where its supposed to go i walk over to the cart as she is getting in her car she catches my eye and i ask if this is her cart she stops talking on the phone and goes into full frontal assault with something to the effect of yeah so what i can leave it where i want you can take it all the way back tot the store and return it ahole i am just speechless as she walks back to her car as she continues talking on her phone explaining that some people just need to mind their own damn business she starts her car and drives away i stand there until i see her turn out of the parking lot and then say to no one in particular because if it is your shopping cart this must be your wallet but i guess she didnt hear me i brought the cart with me shopping and left her wallet on top of a trash can just outside the store i hope she found it
the backstory a few years ago in a sunny old town in the south of england my boyfriend at the time and i had tickets to go and see his favourite band it was going to be a pretty intimate gig with only about or so people there and we were both really looking forward to it so were standing in line to get in to the venue when the boyfriend spots his ex girlfriend also waiting in the queue fine whatever he goes up to her says hello introduces me all is well very civil very english skip ahead a few hours and after several drinks nature is calling and this being a small venue there is only one ladies toilet and who so happens to be in the queue in front of me yes thats right folks the ex girlfriend not a problem i think bit awkward but she was civil enough earlier i enter the cubicle do the business and as i go to open the door i find that i cant open it after pushing and pushing it quickly becomes clear that her and her friends are leaning against the door so i cant get out very mature they eventually give up as the main band is about to go on the revenge the problem was that in order to get into this particular venue you needed to be and i knew for a fact that she was at the time so after the incident in the loo i think well if she wants to act like a child then she might as well be treated like one casually strolling up to the bouncer and alerting him to the fact that there is a girl here who is underage i point her out to him she had bright pink hair hard to miss and she is quickly escorted out when she fails to produce any id missing the band she had been waiting all night to see to top it off she was barred from that particular venueand her bag got stolen not by me i might add tldr immature ex acts like a child gets treated as one
at target there was a hispanic family ahead of me in line discussing their daughters birthday party buying baby formula and other groceries there was a woman in front of me buying some groceries and i noticed that i had a coupon for the hair dye she was buying and was going to give it to her then the woman turned to me and started complaining about the dirty welfare abusing beaners as the familys card was declined i responded with por qu crees eso and she grew increasingly upset saying that mexican is the language of dirty homeless people and calling me one of them i pointed out that the mother was wearing hospital scrubs and probably working her ass off to pay for a family and told the lady that she should take her racist self to another country if she didnt like immigrants i payed for their groceries and told them to have a great day she took her rash cream and diet pills to another lane aisle the best part i didnt give her the coupon

as the title should make obvious ive got a fire hydrant in front of my house my street has plenty of places to park being a residential neighborhood and youd never have to park more than a couple houses away from wherever youre trying to get to of course this is still a problem if youre anything like the guy who lives across the street whenever his driveway is full you can normally fit cars per driveway in my neighborhood his solution is to just park his chevy silverado right outside my house either he doesnt realize its illegal to park in front of a fire hydrant or he doesnt care either way i live in central texas and were not an area of the world where you want to fuck around with when it comes to fire safety look up central texas wildfires if you dont believe me on top of that since his truck is longer than the curb space he parks next to the ass end of his truck sticks a couple feet into my driveway making pulling into my driveway fairly difficult i should also add this is the space where i put my garbage and recycling cans so on garbage day id have nowhere near my curb i can drag my cans to unless i boxed his truck in which i did without a second thought to combat him parking there i started keeping my garbage can out at the curb at all times i figure if there is a fire on my street itll be easier for the fire department to move my garbage can a foot out of the way than his entire truck this all worked as intended until saturday night when i looked out my front window and saw his truck parked there with my garbage can moved on to the sidewalk clearly this wasnt a case of not noticing the fire hydrant since he had to have seen it when he put my garbage can right next to it to make room for him to park he just decided his convenience was more important than the fire departments i left to go pick up a pizza for dinner and nearly took out my own mailbox trying to avoid the back of his truck i decided it was the last straw so when i got home i took some photos of his car and took down the license plate just in case id need evidence i also noticed a bunch of cars parked on the street and a guy walking to parking douchebags house with a case of beer they had a party going on time to spoil it i called city services and asked how i might address the situation knowing theyd likely connect me to the nonemergency police department line they did and i gave them the necessary information as well as a condensed version of what ive written so far they said theyd send an officer out it must have been a slow night because i had a cop at my door within minutes looking for the owner of the truck the dispatcher mistakenly thought i was the owner not the caller i pointed to the house of the offending driver and watched as he knocked on the door brought the guy out and showed him the two parking violations he was citing him for wrote him a ticket and i assume told him to move his car before driving off victory it got better though the guy went to start his car and it wouldnt start he had a few of his friends out helping him now and they got a set of jumper cables they pulled up another truck hooked up the cables and still nothing they spent the next half hour looking at the engine as i sat inside enjoying my pizza and they still couldnt get it going i checked back every few minutes and eventually saw them just standing around having given up on getting the car started it turned out they were waiting for a tow truck to come since the car decided right then and there it didnt want to live anymore the tow truck eventually came and towed the truck away all probably an hour after the police cited him for the violations so on top of the ticket he had to pay for a tow and had to go back to his party knowing hed have to get his truck fixed i woke up yesterday morning took the empty pizza box down to the trash can and set it back in front of the curb knowing he learned his lesson the hard way tldr if youre too inconvenienced to park a few houses down ill make sure you feel that inconvenience tenfold edit although most of the responses this is addressed to have been deleted for all those outraged i didnt just talk to my neighbor i have talked to him in other situations and it hasnt done a thing a few months back his dog was off leash and went after my dog while i was taking him out for a walk he laughed and said his dog was just toughening my dog up on july th around am i went out to ask him and his family to stop shooting off fireworks in the middle of the street which theyd been doing for about three hours and he told me to fuck off they did stop though if he doesnt have the courtesy not to block my driveway im not going to have the courtesy to explain why thats not cool to do
so at the end of our lunch service yesterday i heard the servers talking about this very obnoxious woman who ordered an identical dish as her friend they were very high maintenance and a bit rude though not intolerably so after dropping off the check the server looks over his copy and it occurs to him that he accidentally applied a discount to one of the items oops too late now good for them i guess well the lady calls him over and angrily points out that the meal items are different costs and demands that they be changed to be the same he returns the ticket without the discount and her face goes sour when she realizes what happened clearly she expected the discount to be applied to both items and was hoping to grab an additional im positive she knew what the actual total of the food was everyone looks at how much the food on the menu is before ordering it tldr shouldnt have been greedy and just rolled with what you had
long time reader first time poster please be gentle my husband and i as well as many other members of our church have been having issues with one of the church board members he loves to create controversy over church politics for many of us especially my husband he feels that since his family has been members of this church since the dawn of time he can intimidate everyone to do whatever he wants and can get away with anything this guy also happens to be the church choir director years ago when i was in choir he told us that it absolutely drives him bananas when people clap after the choir sings so since hes been causing so many issues for so many of us guess who leads the applause every week now bravo choir
imagine me nontraditional aampm student who travels miles oneway daily to get to school to cut down on costs i purchased a nissan leaf it gets about miles per charge so by the time i reach school my battery is depleted i need to charge if i want to get back home luckily for me there are about charging stations in the garage i park in many of them have cracked screens that apparently blink cannot be bothered to fix however there are two brand new chargers than have a ev charging only sign on them the others do not that work perfectly so im pulling into the garage rolling past the other chargers that have noncharging cars parked in their spaces not short glorious feet away sit my two beacons of hope there are only a few cars ahead of me i can make it lo and behold a red toyota pulls into one of the spots no big deal theres still one spot so i brake and wait for this guy to pull his stuff out his car well hes taking forever and with his car door wide open in my spot i cant pull in so i honk at him he looks at me then proceeds to move painstakingly slow because apparently im an asshole for wanting to charge my car so after about three minutes of him piddling around his car and me holding up traffic he shuts the door and leaves is that the game you want to play fine game on so i called transportation authority and they sent out someone to give him a ticket asshole
derp i just noticed i a word in the title my bad its supposed to read ticket me for not having a bell on my bike enjoy getting the shit scared out of you i dont think i posted this back when it happened but i digress back in march i was out riding my bike during a fairly nice day weather wise it was a month after i had been hit by a taxi and i was still in a cast and had crutches strapped to the side of my bike at one point while i was stopped on the side of the road and checking my bike i had an officer pull up get out of his car and aggressively tell me to get off my bike long story short a nearby parking garage that i hadnt been anywhere near the whole day reported a white male wearing a black shirt acting suspicious and i just happened to be in the area on a bike that fit the description regardless that i was in a bright red cast with crutches strapped to the side of my bike none of which was reported in the description of this white male this officer was being a real dick giving me a hard time for carrying pepper spray and a pocket knife which are completely legal to possess after a half hour being detained under reasonable suspicion and having two other officers show up to explain that the knife and pepper spray are legal to own im given a ticket for not having a bell on my bike because i bruised this officers ego after repeatedly telling him that the knife and pepper spray are not a crime and possessing them doesnt give him grounds to act like a jackass towards me anyways a month or two passes by the day before im supposed to be in court im out biking and see this same guy giving two skateboarders a hard time weeks ago i had bought this obnoxious air horn intended for bike use i did a quick uturn as started coming down the road behind this jackass and as hes walking back to his car i let this horn rip it was so loud and sudden the jackass visibly jumped in the air then he immediately tried chasing me i went into a skid and turned sharply down a side road ducked into a parking garage went up a pedestrian walk way and went into a nearby coffeeshop that i frequent with my bike and lost him tldr officer jackass gives me a ticket for not having a bell on a bike i buy an air horn and scare the shit out of him a month or two later edit op i pulled my phone out and started inconspicuously recording them about minutes after being stopped after going back through the video i was out of the cast and in a space boot but i either had the cane or crutches with me there are a few other videos i was trying to keep this one going while i called my lawyer but it cut out and nothing overly damning happened him that and the wind made it real hard to understand what was being said 
so last night i went with my family and a friend to a corn mazehaunted house it cost for the corn maze or for the corn maze and haunted house of us bought the corn maze tickets when my friend got there a short time a short time later the attendant insisted she had to buy both tickets at even when she explained she didnt want the haunted house part she said she had to after we were done in the maze we tried to get her a refund on the haunted house part but the manager said sorryno refunds well when the first of us went in there was actually no one taking tickets so we just all walked in so when we were leaving i gathered all unused tickets and went outside the gate and started handing them to people in line waiting to buy tickets people were very happy to get free tickets wont refund us ill give away worth of your tickets 
this revenge isnt exactly recent but i find it happens too often for my tastes and have finally decided to post here i live in a gated apartment complex that can only be entered via typing in a digit passcode on a terminal outside one day as im coming home one of my neighbors zips in front of me with his fancy maserati while im typing my code and just sits there waiting for me like im the doorman instead of finishing the last digits i hatched a plan i put in some bogus codes that i know happen to be discontinued which takes a long time because the gate system is pretty old i could see mr maserati getting pretty impatient scooting forward and stuff like that i wasnt in a hurry so i did a uturn and left him sitting there feet from the gate he wouldve had to do some fancy driving in reverse to reach the number pad from his angle as well i wouldnt know i went and got a drink from across the road this was the first time ive done this to impatient people but it wasnt the last im still doing this to people who feel entitled enough to zip in front of me ill post more if people get extra salty about it in the future
i work for an amazing organization they have a wonderful mission they have pretty great employee perks and the people i get to work with are mostly incredible mostly my supervisor who is actually the director of my program takes advantage of the laid back atmosphere of our workplace most days she comes in anywhere from to and leaves around of course thats when she bothers to show up since august shes taken off days and is embarking on a week vacation in december working with her is basically impossible because she generally only shows up about minutes before scheduled meetings in the office and doesnt stick around long after them if you are not a superior or someone high up in the organization odds are that she wont even bother showing up to the meeting you just confirmed with her the day before email might sound like a great workaround if you have questions or need to discuss something but with her email in gets replied toif shes in a good mood up until last week this was alternatively frustrating and amusing depending on how much shit i wasnt able to accomplish due to her on tuesday our program confirmed a meeting at am and we needed her for several discussions so that she could approve a few paths going forward when rolled around and she still hadnt arrived we just decided to hold the meeting without her as we often do as she only shows about half the time at she emailed us saying shed had slept in and asked if we could meet again that afternoon again not too shocking until i noticed that shed posted an instagram photo called productive morning while we were at our meeting it was a picture of homemade jams and kimchi that shed obviously been caning while we were meeting evidently that shit was more important and more productive than meeting with us and subsequently wasting all of our time this past saturday i came into the office to get some work done while the office was quiet i walked into the kitchen to get some water and grab a snack and thats when i saw it a bag left in the fridge with her name on it and a please dont throw away i peeked inside and what was it two massive slices of cake from the expensive bakery near our office i wasnt even in the mood for cake but i brought those back to my desk and feasted like a king until i felt almost nauseous when she decides to show up for work today shell probably be looking forward to a lunch followed by a decadent desert and i hope i get to see her sad face when she comes back to her desk cakeless it was all in all a truly delicious revenge edit its nearly one and she still isnt here today may just be an unannounced long weekend for her
i have a week old baby who has a tongue tie making it a little tricky for him to latch on well so using a cover is completely out of the question as i would spend more time pulling it off to latch him back on than i would with the cover actually covering anything yesterday at a fast food cafe i started feeding my son a group of middle aged women walked in while i was feeding and chose to sit at the table next to ours despite other tables being available and started moaning loudly between themselves about how feeding my son in public was wrong after minuets of listening to them moan i decided i had enough as soon as they got their food and started tucking in while still moaning about me i turned to my partner and said very loudly that i would stop feeding our son since it was making other guests feel awkward i took my son off my boob and after rearranging my clothes i put him down in his pushchair next to the ladies table as i suspected my son was not happy he was taken off the boob before he finished he then acted like any unhappy baby and decided to scream and cry very loudly i tried to sooth him as best as i could without acting wrong and feeding him but nothing worked he screamed for the whole time these women were eating stopping them from being able to hear each other after minuets of this they got the picture and moved to the table next to the door the other side of the cafe in protest to his noise as soon as they were gone i knew my revenge worked so i latched my son back on to finish his lunch ha enjoy the drafty table by the door you old hags
years and years ago when i was in uni i worked at a games arcade i spent most of my time in a glass booth with a little window to dispense change and prizes through its pretty noisy in the arcade and im behind a glass wall so its hard to speak to the customers one morning we had a particularly offensive couple bring their kid in to play some games and collect tickets i had to speak to them a couple of times to stop the kid climbing the machines stop eating and getting crumbs everywhere things like that worse was when i see the dad teaching the kid how to cheat with some of the games then i see the mum telling the kid to stuff his rubbish into the machines instead of the bins right next to them seriously luckily earlier in the week i had learnt by mistake a psychological trick that would prove to make this type of customer more tolerable i had been biding my time waiting for the right candidate when the dad came up to redeem the tickets i softly told him the number of tickets he had earned so there was no way of him hearing over the sounds of the game machines in the background then when it was clear he hadnt heard i leaned forward and he instinctively reciprocated and smacked his face hard into the glass wall i went on to do this several times to deserving customers but the first was the most satisfying by far
i work in manhattan and i really cant deal with the insane lines at delis to get lunch so i usually wait until pm to go so this one day i got to the deli and it is a little busy but not too bad the hot food line is busy but i want a wrap and there is just one guy waiting for his order to be ready so i walk up to the counter and wait this attractive blonde girls walks in she is prob or so makeup and hair all done looking really good so she walks up to the counter right next to the cash register the next spot the guy behind the counter has his back turned making a sandwich he turns around and looks at both us and the girl starts ordering i did a dafuq look and the guy behind the counter interrupts her and goes oh is it ladies first today he looks at me for direction on how to proceed i look at the girl she is giving me the doe eyes like oh whoopsies you dont mind if i go first right kind of bashful smile thing going on not going to lie it was pretty cute but fuck that i am a married yo the jedi mind tricks no longer have any effect on me i turn the to guy and say ill have a tuna salad wrap with lettuce and tomato it was not ladies first that day
this happened a few years ago i was in college living in what i called the student ghetto my neighbors were a couple of girls who were living out of the dorms or parents house for the first time unfortunately for them they had all sorts of problems with breakins to their home it happened about four times one day we had to enter the crawl space the area under the house where all the heatingcooling equipment was located when we got down there we realized why the house had been broken into there was a homeless person residing down there we found fast food wrappers all over the place and one of the cups still had ice in it we called the landlord and he didnt care at all refused to come down to even and put a lock on the door to the crawlspace so i went to the local hardware store to get a lock and when i got there a better idea dawned on me i purchased about twenty of the biggest screws i could find and a phillips head bit that i wasnt afraid to get ruined then i came back to the neighbors house went back into the crawlspace to make sure no one was under there didnt want any homeless people to be harmed in my petty revenge on the landlord then i screwed the door to the crawlspace closed with a screw every inch or so the entire way around the door i stripped the screws to make it nearly impossible and certainly a giant pain in the ass to ever remove them the girls got to live the rest of the lease without any breakins then moved to a different house mr landlord good luck getting in the crawlspace to ever do any maintenance work on your heating and cooling system tldr landlord wouldnt protect innocent girls from breakins so i effectively permanently sealed off his access to the heatingcooling system
my housemates and i have just returned from our weekly shop at our local supermarket we buy loads of stuff for the family dinners we share together in the evenings and also pick up anything we want individually for the week stuff for lunch snacks beers etc we unload the big family shop through first and then all the other individual shops are unloaded and paid forwellindividually afterwards we are well aware this could be problematic and hold up the queue so we have honed our checkout routine down to a fine art one man unloads the trolley onto the checkout belt whilst two men pack the bags and the other man prepares to pay so back to today the trolley unloader had unloaded all of the family shop which took up the whole belt as we get a fair bit before he started unloading the individual stuff left in the trolley of which there was clearly still quite a lot he came to help us pack the family food in an attempt to speed things along enter the woman who has subsequently been dubbed the anitetiquette ae as the checkout belt moved forward and we packed the food away ae decided to unload her shopping onto the belt right behind ours bear in mind the belt had been full so we could fit no more on there we had not placed a divider at the end of our shopping to signify the next shopper should start unloading onto the belt and we still had a significant amount of shopping left in our trolley which was in clear sight okay not the end of the world perhaps she was just oblivious to her surroundings and it was an honest mistake nope we politely informed her that we were not done with our shopping she responded with well i suppose youll have to put the rest through after me then not a fucking chance lady immediately a beautifully petty plan was hatched in our collective brains we squeezed the individual shopping onto the belt alongside the family stuff fine balancing acts were being performed by groceries from all walks of life it was tough but after a couple of minutes of grocery tetris we made it excellent already wasted a couple of minutes of her precious precious time the coup de grce however was yet to come when it came to paying the polite and efficient thing to do would have been to split the bill equally and then sort out who owed what for the individual items back at home ae had sadly surrendered that privilege when she shat all over everything british by disobeying queue etiquette my housemates and i proceeded to squabble for minutes about who owed what for the individual items displaying some disgraceful mental arithmetic whilst loudly lamenting the fact that this would never have happened if we could have just separated our shopping the way we had wanted oh woe is me tldr fuck with queue etiquette in britain prepare to be moderately inconvenienced

i was recently in a hour flight and was seated in front of this manchild he was being really loud annoying and kept kicking the bottom of my seat as soon as we are allowed i proceed to try and recline my seat just a bit but no as soon as i was able to recline it a bit it popped back up to the upright position i immediately realized it was him and i kept trying to recline it it got to a point that i had both feet propped up against the back of the armrests of the seat in front of me trying to get enough leverage to recline my seat but i could feel his hands pushing through the seat i didnt even want to recline it all the way down but there was no way in hell i was about to spend a hour flight without reclining my seat he was a pretty big dude but seriously if he knew enough to keep me from reclining my seat he should know enough how cramped economy is i stopped trying pretty quickly i knew i wasnt going to win that way but he stood up about an hour into the flight and i got my change to recline it all the way down even if i didnt want it that low it was better than staying upright for hours did i mention that i hate airline food oh i slept though the crappy dinner and the shitty breakfast that they served and the flight attendant didnt ask me to put my chair back up until we were about to land i gave him a few good farts too

went to childrens edutainment joint called little explorers with my year old daughter they have these hands on games where the kids play with these contraptions designed to teach kids motor skills etc they had these small rubber duckies that kids play with putting them in a stream of water and stuff my daughter was collecting the ducks from the stream to put them in a bucket a kid comes up to her probably a year old and snatches one of the ducks from her and then pushes her down and she starts crying i walk up to him and tell him firmly to not do that and everyone should play together the little bastard throws the duck at me and when the attendant intervenes splashes water on her face the kids dad walks up to me and i explain whats been happening he shrugs it off takes his kid and walks off instead of even trying to discipline the little shit i did not want to create any commotion in a kids playing place so i thought i will gulp this one down later on the same kid was playing on a wooden machine where you pull various levers to progress a ball through obstacles he was climbing on top of it and lost his balance got his hair badly stuck in one of the levers i could have saved him from falling but i did not my daughter gave a chuckle seeing him stuck in there take that you little shit edit stumbled upon this this is very relevant here
back when i was in high school i was in a chemistry class and i have long hair currently m then probably about this girl came up behind me with scissors and cut a good little chunk of my hair out she then threw it at me and laughed with her dumb friends over at their table i dont know what planet this girl was on that she thought it would be okay to fuck with the guy with long hair and escape with impunity i swiftly grabbed the same pair of scissors walked right up behind her and grabbed a sizable amount of her hair in my fist and chopped it off and i mean a noticeable amount i then blew the hair out of my hand in front of her friends nodded in satisfaction and returned to my seat needless to say they learned their lesson edit sorry it seems as though i left out what happened next as a lot of you have been asking basically she began crying a small amount and her friends got all pissy with me of course what i did was so wrong even though she just did it to me well between her whimpering and my friends and i laughing the teacher turned around to ask what was the commotion she said what i did and the teacher was about to send me to the office until i explained how this girl initiated it and i was going to stand for being disrespected like that the teacher felt like we were even and just resumed with her lesson victory
this just happened so at my work we have a desk with two computers on each side my boss was nice enough to attach chargers to each computer four total of the two chargers on each side one is for iphones amp the other for androids this setup has irritated me before because theres been a few times that my coworkers unplug my phone i usually dont mind if their phone is about to die amp mine is nearly full but there has been some times that people will take mine off the charger regardless one time one of them who is an android user while i have an iphone decided to unplug mine try to plug theirs in amp upon realizing she couldnt use that charger plugged theirs into a free android charger but didnt plug mine back in i never figured out who did it so i couldnt do anything some time passes amp ive pretty much gotten it out of my mind but today something similar happened my phone was charging amp when i left the computers i saw a coworker unplug mine to plug in his then when i went to retrieve my phone i looked to the other side of the counter amp saw that the other iphone charger wasnt in use he was just to lazy to look on the other side once i saw the other charger was free i unplugged his phone amp left it sitting on the counter after about an hour he comes back to check his phone amp finds it unplugged he kind of mutters under his breath my phones only at i couldve sworn i plugged it in
so i work at a small restaurant and for the most part me and my coworkers get along except when it comes to music in the kitchen we have a small stereo with an aux cord so we can listen to whatever we want while we work my coworker john has been hogging it like crazy its just me and john in the kitchen i will ask for a turn playing music and hell grant it but usually within minutes his ipod is plugged back in playing his music now i can enjoy pretty much anything the problem is he plays the same ishsong playlist every day on repeat as you can imagine that gets old really fast the revenge for the last week ive been fucking with him whenever were really busy ill grab his ipod and change it from repeat all to repeat song so instead of just looping his playlist it just starts looping the same song indefinitely since i do this when were busy he usually doesnt notice for a good minutes and when he finally does he grabs his ipod and goes what the fuck stop im pretty sure he thinks his ipods malfunctioning however long it takes i plan on making him so sick of that playlist he never wants to hear it again tldr coworker plays the same playlist on repeat every day i keep switching it to repeat the same single song when hes not looking slowly driving him mad
my husband and i work at the same company different departments different floors we have a great relationship and are always honest with each other for example hell say to me i can see your upper lip hair and ill say thank you and go take care of it he has a couple of office girlfriends about the company i call them that not him harmless fun for him and i like he has other people to go and talk to plus it eases the burden on me not having to listen to his complaints about work all the time he can be a debbie downer at times there is nothing sexual nor too emotional about it light flirting with each other joking but mostly an opportunity for them to complain about the same people within the company a few months ago he found a new office girlfriend i thought nothing of it until a couple of weeks ago when i was on her floor quietly using the photocopier as mine had broken down my husband was there chatting with her and although he and i had exchanged eye contact and subtle winky faces i dont think she realised i was there her body language revealed she has a crush on him or was developing more than professional feelings she had a huge smile while gazing at him stroking her hair laughing a little too loudly at his dumb jokes that actually makes me feel proud and quite smug my husband is quite a catch this morning my husband had coffee with me as usual and as he said goodbye and lent in for a kiss he said he was off to go see new office girlfriend to work on this project for a couple of hours i knew that it meant they would be physically close looking at the same computer monitor i didnt tell him that his breath was stinky enough to wipe out a village 
last year i lived in a big row of townhouses conjoined on either side my bedroom was in the basement and my neighbour presumably had a bedroom on the other side of the wall now these walls are paper thin i can hear sneezes conversations even loud farts well this neighbour lives with about four other guys our age and usually at least two are home at any given time well i guess the gentleman in question had the house to himself a rare occurrence one night at about am he is just blasting porn terrible fake girl screaming for minutes porn anyway i knock politely on the wall nothing knock again not certain but i think the volume went up two can play this game motherfucker so i hook up my gigantic speakers to my lap top its important to note that my roommate wasnt home either and search for noisy gay threesome or something on youporn oh god so much mangrunting and dirty talking to boot and so fucking loud yeah he turned it off

story time i used to work a small mom and pop owned company for absolutely the worst bosses ever they acted like fezziwig to the community and scrooge to their employees the business manager is the wife and thats literally her only qualification shes talentless petty jealous and holds grudges we all hated her she would call meetings for the retail crew which i was in and blame us for low numbers while simultaneously not giving us the money to buy the best selling items i dont know what she expected our best sellers cost us an we sold them for every day we moved items or so it was stupid for her to refuse restocking them so i planned my petty machiavellian vengeance on her shes in her mid s and is about pounds overweight so she was always trying fad diets and exercise plans but never lost a pound which i knew bothered her so when she called us in for het monday morning why arent you selling things we dont have nonsense rodeo i brought a dozen doughnuts for people half the meeting she talked to the box instead of us and reluctantly she had one then two doughnuts i left them in the office and politely told the other workers about them so on and off people would go and grab one walking in front of her door that friday she fired our hardest worker drove delivery and replaced him with two part timers who still didnt do as good as him this was to avoid giving him insurance and because he had earned about an hour in raises over years this meant war next monday i came in with three boxes of doughnuts glorious delicious weapons to fight with i only brought one box into the meeting room and i cut up all the rest on my coffee break into quarters i then casually told everyone that i had done so and please microwave yourself a small piece because they are delicious warm so now we have it people occasionally microwaving yummy smelling donuts all day next to the office of the evil diet queen it broke her on tuesday there was a sign that said no doughnuts in the office and i was fired the following friday probably for unrelated reasons but it was so worth it to hear here tell a friend that shed gained weight over that season tldr waged war with doughnuts and politeness
i had just gone shopping and was driving out of the publix parking lot my car was nearly to the end of the aisle when this vile woman leaned out from between the last two cars saw me coming and then shoved her cart out in front of me like she was daring me to hit it the look on her face was pure evil in a way i cant exactly explainlike she was mad at me for being there at all and i wasnt going to inconvenience her by driving past and making her wait three seconds anyway i was only going a few miles per hour but what she did was so egregious that i still had to brake to avoid hitting the cart she then proceeded to walk in front of my car down the middle of the aisle so i couldnt go around her and then walked diagonally through the crosswalk so id have to wait some more she also walked at a glacial pace but that just gave me time to plan my revenge when i was finally able to inch out of the aisle to make my right turn she ended up right next to my drivers side door as she meandered towards the store as soon as my window was right by the back of her head i laid on my horn long and loud she jumped like someone had jammed a surprise thumb up her butt and whipped around in a fury just in time to see my bird finger right in her face before she had time to react i was gone tldr fly bitch fly

a few years back i lived in an apartment underneath one other apartment that housed students the landlord had set up the cable tv service so that our apartment was the host for the tv control boxes being used upstairs upstairs could control what programmes they wanted to watch but we had total control on whether the system was plugged into the wall or not the boys upstairs played obnoxiously loud music most nights wed tried talking to them and they werent particularly neighbourly in their approach it caused a huge amount of frustration for us noise control didnt want to hear about it and we all had to sleep with ear plugs one night the sound was particularly deafening until am the next evening there was a major sports game on tv and theyd invited their mates around to watch it we were also watching it but on my roommates computer which we played through our tv every time a goal was imminent we disconnected the cable tv from the wall until the goal and its replays were over and done with then wed hook it up again there were screams of frustration from upstairs we continued this for the full mins of game coverage while still watching it ourselves in peace it didnt solve the loud music problem but my roommates and i did this sometimes during big games just to enjoy their yells of frustration they never had any idea how it was happening
i work at a discount store we often sell bread that is close to expiry by a week or so for rather than the grocery store equivalent of customers love this deal and come in twice a week to get their expensive bread at a better price than anywhere else among other things but one customer well call him chris comes in only for this deal he always makes a big deal that he has to make a special trip to our store for this even though he works and lives in town he is rude and demeaning to every member of my staff except the actual manager so when he calls to ask if we have the bread i tell him we do but due to the nature of its popularity we can no longer put it on hold for you by the time he gets there it has been mysteriously sold to another customer me i get a staff discount on the bread so i can buy it for even though i dont eat bread i buy up every loaf that he likes and i leave it in the staff room in case my coworkers forget a lunch or missed breakfast chris always complains that its gone by the time he gets here and tries to blame staff for not saving any and makes a huge fuss acting like hes better than us and the store yet has no problem getting deals from us every week with a smile i always recommend him to the health food place next door as they sell the same bread for a loaf enjoy your overpriced bread asshole

i used to work for a large telecommunications company uk in the retail sector the manager was awful she was loud rude cruel used to deny people a holiday day because she knew how much they wanted to spend the day with their partner etc and totally up herself were talking super vain here she made comments about dont they know who i am when put on hold we hated her so id recently moved back to a small town after a couple of years working for the same company in a larger city and they only had a part time vacancy of about short shifts a week i took it because i knew she told me someone was going to get fired id actually worked for the company longer than she had but thats not relevant to the story she used to insist that members of the team show up half an hour before their shift even though company policy asks cannot enforce is unpaid we show up mins before over a week this would equate to around hours extra of my being at work unpaid just to sit out the back for no other reason than her control issues anyhoo i was in town one day and stopped by a rather well known coffee outlet to pick up my favourite skinny iced beverage and took it to work to drink before i started my manager saw me and decided to drink some didnt ask just took it out of my hands and drank it was the final straw pun intended she said how delicious it was and when i told her it was lowfat she was really impressed as she had problems with her weight she wasnt fat she was just a couple of sizes bigger than suited her frame and she was really paranoid about it next shift im on my way in for the half hour before my shift started i know she couldnt enforce it but she was such a nasty vindictive person that it just wasnt worth the hassle when i pass by the aforementioned coffee shop my mind starts to fizz with a very evil and very petty plan i call her up say im getting a lowfat iced coffee and if shed like one i also mention theres rather a long queue there wasnt she gets all excited and greedy and says shed love one after mentioning that all the fuckers in the queue should move dont they know im waiting for my drink so in i go stand and chat for a few minutes wasting time and of course order one deliciously skinny icy coffee for me and one full fat extravaganza for her i even got them to add the whipped cream before they finished it so it wouldnt be sat on top giving me away i slowly walked to work handed her the heartattack maker and watched her drink it all she did actually pay me for it which made it even better so id gotten to work ten minutes before my shift and ruined her diet i continued to do this at least twice a week for the following months before i went full time she couldnt understand why her shirt was getting tighter and tighter some of those things have almost half a days calorie allowance i never told anyone until now it still makes me laugh im chuckling now tl dr bitch boss makes me sit at work for no real reason i doctor her skinny coffee and give her a weight problem ps new here so apologise in advance for any formatting errors i did read the formatting help but hopefully this wont end up a wall of text job
so i was going to checkout at the grocery store last night and there is two people in front of me and four or five people behind me one guy pushes his way through all the people waiting in line to be next to his buddy and puts his stuff in the same section between the little dividers fine i thought they are paying together and he needed to grab some last minute stuff no problem nope he payed separate and just wanted to be next to his buddy and in front of everyone gave him a dirty look but was ready to forget it when i noticed they were behind me to pull out of the parking lot what a convenient time to check my phone rummage through the glovebox double check my grocery list and reorganize my groceries in the backseat after ten minutes of honking and swearing i decided it was time to depart verrrrrrryyyyy slowly he was going the same way as me so i cost him around to minutes of travel time which is so inconsiderate when he was in such a hurry to check out 
i used to work at things remembered which is a store that sells a bunch of keepsake shit with space for engravings we would do the engravings in the store not by hand but with these big machines the way they would work is youd put the piece into the clamps on the machine type in what you want engraved and play with the settings of which only two mattered how many passes the machine would make and how much force would be behind the needle since we engraved anything from glass to stainless steel these varied settings were necessary it would usually take five to fifteen minutes to do but the company policy is to tell the customer itll be an hour in case theres a backlog and the store is in a mall so waiting an hour wasnt a big deal there was plenty to occupy yourself with and customers never seemed to have a problem with this except this one woman she came in and bought a door knocker wanted her familys name engraved on it ok no problem i do the papers for her order and tell her itll be about an hour she completely lost her shit at this insisting that her time was too valuable to waste in a mall and she would wait in the store thank you very much and she did hovering like a bitchy hawk as i plugged her order into the engraving machine so of course i chose to put the needle on the lightest force possible with as many passes as possible turning what would have been a five minute job into yep sixty minutes that damn machine was grinding away for a full hour and she lurked around the store the entire time take that you selfimportant bitch
original so some background first i bartend in a restaurant in midtown manhattan because the neighborhood is primarily officesretail it tends to get dead later at night unlike the rest of this city our kitchen closes at last call for the bar is but if we have no guests we close at also we have two bars one in a barlounge area that i usually work at and one in the restaurant area that also has a bit of seating at the bar now that thats done onto the story i have a manager well call him jim who is sort of a pain often forgets to transfer checks for guests who move from bar to dining room always hovering when you dont need him but cant find him when you do need him etc when other managers are closing if it was a slow night and i have no people at my bar around they will let me close up and go home since we have another bar as well its not like someone who came in would not be able to get a drink when jim closes he always gets upset if we even hint at asking to be cashed out before pm claiming that our bar is open until we have to be consistent this is the life we chose bla bla bla jim is also the manager who lobbied for the pm closing time of the bar we used to have an informal last call at pm i am fine staying if i have guests sometimes it can be a drag but whatever i deal with it and usually make the best of it i am not fine staying for an hour when i havent had a customer in over an hour and of the time will not get another one between tonight i had a big group come down for a colleagues going away party a few people stayed and lingered afterwards two women in particular they were having some sparkling wine fun to talk to one was doing a fantasy draft later in the night and i was talking with them about that rolls around and their glasses are empty i ask if i can get them anything else and they decide on another round at this point they are the last people in the whole restaurant i went and told jim he got all pissy and told me to try and drop them their check asap so he could do his closing paperwork and said he had stuff to do and didnt want to be in late tonight now i had a nice rapport with these ladies nothing to do tonight or tomorrow that was urgent and didnt want to seem rude to them or try to rush them out after all our bar is open until pm and we have to be consistent so i talked with them about ireland and fantasy football for minutes while they finished their bubbly and jim sat in a booth in the restaurant pouting and messing around on his phone i got a tip on an tab and got to feed jim some of his own medicine was a great way to finish the night tldr manager at my restaurant likes to be a stickler about staying til close no matter what and being consistent he wants me to try and get my fun guests to close out early so he can finish his work and go home i choose to be consistent and let them stay til the time he chose making a nice tip in the process
this was posted elsewhere as a response to someone elses petty revenge and i was asked to create this as a stand alone revenge the masses have spoken so here it is i worked briefly as a server in fine dining during a time when i was between jobs never had serving experience before but my brother worked there and was well liked and somehow he talked the manager into hiring me despite my lack of experience anyway i digress so something i despised during my time serving were the little hellions that would run around or scream in the restaurant if you think this is unacceptable in a casual restaurant imagine how it is perceived in fine dining where our steaks ranged from so i came up with my own revenge on the parents of these little devils we had a dessert called the chocolate volcano it was basically a chocolate cake filled with fudge and a scoop of ice cream placed on top as a server i could comp these desserts using my discretion if the bill was big enough my manager would okay this if it wasnt i could put it on my dime so i would do exactly that after collecting their dinner plates i would go up to tiny beelzebub and ask him if he wanted one on the house id give the parents a wink and tell them it was totally free id make it out like i was doing them a favor so there was no way they could complain to my manager now this put the parents in a bad place the typical diner was wrapping up their meals at at night and this chocolate volcano was loaded with sugar you knew it just looking at the thing so the parents had to choose their poison either be horrible unfair parents in their childs eyes thus having to deal with a conniption fit in the car because he didnt get his free treat or give in but then have to deal with a kid so sugared up he wasnt going to sleep for hours youre welcome assholes now learn to discipline that little shit stain of yours tldr justice is a dish best served for dessert edit so i looked online for a description of the chocolate volcano at my old restaurant and it is this warm chocolate cake with a melted fudge center and topped with vanilla bean gelato
so last week as usual i was riding the train on my way to college at around am in case you dont know the am train is crammed with people and i only get a seat because i take it at the terminal some time goes by when this guy id say around years old hopps on the train and after scanning left and right stands right by my seat he just stands there looking at me with an impatient face i can obviously tell this guy wants my seat even when he clearly sees the medical boot i have on my right leg i sprained my ankle playing rugby whatever i just ignore him and carry on listening to my music a couple of minutes go by he taps my shoulder and when i take out my ear buds he tells me you know you should really respect your elders more i look at him with a face like saying are you fucking with me right now and when i see hes serious i think to myself fuck it its only more station until i get off and i dont really want any trouble minutes before my final after i get up and stand near the exit this man who looked around and listened to the whole thing goes up to him looks straight at him and says with a completely deadpan face could i have this seat please its reserved for the elderly the guy gets up reluctantly grumbling and clearly displeased and when the train stops at my station im about to get out i look at the man who avenged me he is looking straight at me and with a slight grin on his face winks at me
went into a costco just to get one item and order something from the snack bar outside didnt even need a cart as im walking to the checkout line i see angry old bitch heading for the same line i am from the opposite direction with her cart full of groceries well it looks like shell have to wait for me to buy my one item because im getting to the line first i do get there first with her arriving mere seconds later however she doesnt push her cart behind me she pulls it up next to me and makes it clear with her positioning that she intends to use the cart to wedge herself ahead of me in line a glance at her face shows that shes already preparing a tirade of furious shouting if i call her on her bullshit strategy so talking with aob is out of the question however looking at my line and the line next to me i realize that my lines cashier is a new guy and the two people directly in front of us have a lot in their carts meanwhile the line next to us while clearly longer consists of carts with only a few items each and their cashier is someone whos worked there for years so its probably no surprise that rather than fighting aob for dominance i simply switched lines at first i could see a smug look of superiority on her face as it seemed she had won that look turned to one of confusion when i flashed her a smile by the time i reached the front of my line her cart hadnt moved an inch and as i pulled out my wallet to pay i turned to look straight at her and once again gave her a nice smile of satisfaction a smile that i kept on her as i walked to the exit seething rage flooding her ugly features tldr try to steal my spot in line ill rub it in your face as i switch to a better line and leave the store before your line even budges
so this happened a few years ago when i was working abroad as a translator my boss was a real piece of shit had very strange mood swings and would not understand how long it takes to do the work this one time he gave me a page medical document that needed translation real complicated shit after days of working on it i was about pages in he comes in in a rage shouting in front of everyone that i better finish because its really important and he needs it right now it was a regular occurrence for him to ask for stuff he didnt need just to be the shouting boss swinging his dick around i tried to explain as i did when he gave me the assignment that it would take at least another week to finish it oh he wouldnt hear about it and he just shouted i need it today i wasnt really intimidated by him and just looked at him blankly because i couldnt comprehend how people can be that way so naturally i did what anyone else would do i opened google translate copy paste edited it a bit which took a couple of hours and printed the bad boy to present to raging asshole you guess what happened he couldnt give two shits about the finished thing he didnt even look at it for over weeks so to my petty revenge i know his company and personal emails which i signed up for all kinds of spammy shit including a lot of weird porn so whenever i logged into his email which i needed to do to email providers in other countries i would delight myself with the sight of all this shit emails on his inbox which were per day sometimes i would select all the deleted spam emails and return them to the inbox he raged so much about it and i giggled inside made the rest of my stay at that shithole lots more enjoyable i would say i signed him up for websites in all kinds of languages i would do this everytime there was a lull at work tldr signed up asshole boss to of spammy newslettersporn watched him raged daily english is not my first language so if you see any mistakes shut the fuck up nobody cares thanks
a bit of background my dad lives out in the country and gets pretty poor cell reception at his house when he gets home he usually puts his cell phone on the charger in his bedroom since the reception is terrible and most people will just call his landline anyway he spends of his time at home parked on the couch and if anyone calls him on his cell phone he grumbles as he gets up walks back to the bedroom answers the call and attempts to quickly tell them to call the landline before the call is dropped on to the petty revenge when at work i leave my cell phone on silent i meet with clients all day and i dont really like to have my phone go off in the middle of a meeting lately my dad has decided he doesnt like how i dont regularly answer his calls while im at work so he has started leaving me very serious voicemails saying things like this is your father you should always take my calls stop putting me through to voicemail and more often than not i find out when i call him back that he only called to tell me what his latest deadlift was at the gym very very critical information i know so ive started calling him back on his cell phone when i know hes at home so he has to get up off the couch and grumble all the way back to his bedroom to answer it and tell me he is at home and to call the landline take that dad edit i a word edit and yes my dad is lonely but i talk to and see him regularly he is merely unreasonable on occasion in that he expects me to drop everything im doing to take his every call he usually ignores my calls when he is at work so its a very obvious double standard
thisll be short sweet and pretty nasty so basically husband and i were getting down and doing the horizontal shuffle when he suggested i give him some oral loving hes straddled over my chest and decides to blow his gentlemens relish all over my face which is great but it shoots directly up my nostrils and into my brain he thought this was absolutely hilarious literally rolling with laughter and tells me i look like a dragon now if youve ever experienced the joy of having baby gravy in the eyes or nose youll know it fucking stings like satans butthole so i hop up to try and clear it out drinking water and cursing like a sailor husband comes into the bathroom as i take a big swig of water and as he leans in for his postvictory kiss i squirt him in the mouth with a gush of spunkwater he chokes spits it out and looks disgusted at me sorry husband but you dont mess with an angry dragon
so all the bullying stories on here have inspired me to recount what happened in my youth with a bully so back in the s we had a bully in class well more than one really he and his little henchmen always thought it was fun to pick on smaller kids or just beat them up so about th grade it seems it my turn for the his attention so after a few times of pushes and name calling etc i decided to do a little research next time he tried to start something i edged a little ways away each time he said something till we were out of range of his friends i leaned into him and said look jeff you may be able to kick my ass here in front of your friends to look like a big shot but you never know when someone may be lurking behind that big bush next to your house at said address with a fucking bat ready to put you in the fucking hospital when no one is around to help you so i think maybe its time to back the fuck off and stay the fuck out of my and my friends faces he just looked at the raw hate in my eyes and backed up and walked away after that every time i saw he looking at me for to long i made the arm swing like i was swinging a bat and he would move on
so im doing some backpackeringtraveling right now the other day i arrive at a hostel and wait to check in theres one girl working the front desk and shes telling a british guy that he will be charged extra because he moved from the single bed that he had paid for to a double bed which costs more as usually two people share it this guy is clearly the privileged drinking holiday type and he yells and yells at this girl that shes trying to rip him off and he wont stand for it she tries repeatedly to explain the policies for switching beds without asking and for different bed sizesprices but he keeps talking over her and cutting her off before she can finish a single sentence and finally culminates with a condescending do you not understand god do you even speak english he begrudgingly paid but the entire lobby and probably half the block heard his feelings about it fast forward to about am when im awoken by a slap on the butt while im sleeping on my stomach in a bed right next to the door of the dorm confused surprised and sleepy all i can react with is a mumble of what the man standing over me laughs and even in the dark i realize that its the lovely gentleman from before hes clearly very drunk and yells youre staying in a hostel what do you expect he stumbles around the room talking loudly playing terrible music on his phone and waking everyone up before declaring that hes going to go back to the bar to find some pussy he slams the door behind him and out of both habit and spite i reach over and lock it behind him some short time later theres pounding at the door and this guy yells through that he doesnt have his key he forgot his phone and someone should let him in the other people trying to sleep and i were all like hell no he can sleep outside its loud and annoying but eventually he stops and we all sleep peacefully and indeed when i get up at am for some sightseeing i see him passed out on an armchair in the hallway when i get back to the hostel around an hour after checkout time mr manners is at the front desk again this time yelling because hes being charged a late checkout fee because he overslept since his phone was in the room hes also trying to get out of paying for the bed at all because he didnt actually sleep in it but no he has to pay the rate and the fee that made me feel good the best part though was that it was the same employee from the day before and when he said it wasnt his fault that he missed the checkout time and someone else should pay it for him she just smiled and said in her flawless and only slightly accented english im sorry i dont even speak english so i dont understand this is how much you owe
i worked in a jewelry store for a long time one day these two ladies were looking for a gift for a family member i think it was a birthday gift anyway they were deciding between two necklaces a diamond solitaire pendant amp a diamond cross they werent extravagant pieces but either would have made a nice gift i complimented their choices amp the lady who was making the purchase was a total snotty bitch about it she made a nasty face at me then gave me this rude speech about how a cross necklace isnt a piece of jewelry its a religious statement how dare i compare this cross to a solitaire pendant she rolled her eyes in disgust amp pushed the solitaire pendant back at me i wanted so badly to rudely explain to her that i know what a cross represents amp that i grew up christian amp went to christian schools growing up i should have told her i was muslim instead i grudgingly kept a fake smile on my face amp offered to gift wrap the necklace throughout the entire transaction she never thanked me or was nice in any way she was a total bitch what a christian attitude i wish i could have seen the look on her face when the gift was opened amp they saw that i pinned the cross upside down in the box 
i work as tier support for a large organization and while most of the time its a fun job there are times when you get people who just will not be pleased no matter what you do this is one of those times something you should know about where i work is that like most places a large majority of the employees including our tier team do not work weekends while our helpdesk is if you have an issue that is beyond me and i have to escalate it and its a weekend or a night youre going to have to wait so a few days ago i got a call from a woman who wanted help adding her outlook account to her desktop a simple fix one i was more than happy to help her with i remoted into her computer fixed her issue and she was happy for a short period of time after i had fixed that issue of hers she decided to ask about another issue she had something about very important her emphasis not mine files that were stored on a former employees account they didnt have any backups of these files why would they and she wanted access to them she told me she had already emailed the people who are responsible for doing what she needed done but wanted to check what was going on with it because she had submitted it on friday which i later learned she had submitted on pm on a friday so of course they didnt get to it i felt sorry for her so i offered to send it up to our tier again but this time with a higher priority so they would get to it sooner at this point this conversation happened gther if that will get it taken care of sooner then yes go ahead and do that but im very unhappy with the slow response time on this issue i submitted this on friday gtme im sorry maam im not sure why they werent able to get to it then but unfortunately there isnt much i can do today as nobody is in the office right now who has the access to help you gther well that is just unacceptable i just feel like this should have been taken care of far sooner than monday gtme once again im very sorry about this would you like to talk to my supervisor he could at least get your complaint further up than i can gther no no i dont want to complain i just want to make it clear that i am unhappy with how this has been taken care of when i complain im just going to talk to the top gtme well okay maam if you dont want to is there anything else you need assistance with today or is that all gther well im still very unhappy about how you guys have been handling this account issue i dont want to complain but i want to make it very clear that i am not satisfied with the level of help ive received from you people gtme im sor gther no its okay thank you for your attempt click since i had just spent minutes helping her with her various computing issues i wasnt too happy with her goodbye so when i submitted her ticket to tier i set its priority to low tldr lady thanks me for my attempt after i spend minutes helping her i set her very important ticket to low priority

im a longtime lurker on this subreddit and last night i had one of the most wonderful experiences of my life and thought you all might enjoy it im not sure if this entirely qualifies as petty and it was more something i was vaguely a part of but had no completely active role but here we go also sorry for the length im horrible at formatting helpful background information in my state there is a really popular convenience storegas station chain that everyone absolutely loves including myself i also used to work there so i know how the drill goes with some of the moreintolerable customers in this gas station they have little kitchens that serve food and drinks like soft pretzels flatbread sandwiches specialty coffee milkshakes etc to order something from the kitchen there are touch screen stations where you basically select your order it prints a receipt and you go and pay while the person in the kitchen makes your food the story my boyfriend and i have gotten out of classes pretty late because he had a group meeting so were driving home from our university and decide to stop and treat ourselves to a festive eggnog milkshake from the convenience store to celebrate finishing the semester we pull into the parking lot and go inside and its pretty busy but we maneuver our way to the kitchen to order our shakes standing in front of one of the two ordering stations is a woman and her two earlyteen daughters maybe she already looks like shes pissed though my first thought is that she just has an unfortunate case of resting bitch face boyfriend and i type in our orders at the station get our receipt and go to pay as were paying i notice that the lady has dragged some employee over to the station and is making them typing in her order for her as a previous employee of this place i know that sometimes people are unaware that they can do the orders themselves but usually after showing them how its done they have no problem doing it alone but this lady is getting more and more distressed as shes making the employee put her food in for her the boyfriend and i go back to the kitchen after paying and wait patiently for our shakes since our order other orders have been put in so two employees are back in the kitchen quickly trying to make everyones order its all open so you can see everything the only thing separating customers from the kitchen is a little swinging gate and a sheet of clear plastic to keep people from reaching over the counter i look up at the order screen where my boyfriend and is order is in first with our two eggnog shakes and then next is the angry ladys and then some other couple who have ordered grilled cheese the angry lady lets just call her al has ordered an icecream and an eggnog shake and the instant i see that she too has requested this fabulous drink i know were going to have an issue shes standing a few feet away from us huffing and puffing and dramatically sighing as the two employees rush to make everyones things unfortunately there is only one blender so they can only make one shake at a time and she notices this and continues to make snide remarks under her breath about how long shes been waiting though if she had typed in her order herself she wouldve had her things by now because who knows how long she was standing there before i came in one eggnog shake is done and al immediately starts reaching for it but the employee brings it over to my boyfriend and i because our order was in first and sets it down in front of us al immediately says rather loudly seriously weve been standing here forever she gets no response which seems to aggravate her even more the employees start making our second shake and im getting frustrated listening to als ranting so i quietly say to my boyfriend that im glad we put our orders in first so we can leave and get away from her without even looking at us al responds to what i said and goes actually i dont think thats right we put our order in first that shake should be ours my boyfriend opens his mouth to say something when one of the employees turns around with the second finished shake and holds it just out of reach of als groping fingers and says as if she hadnt heard any of what had just happened im going to give this to them because they put their order in first and its only fair then she walks over gives us the shake and al is practically shaking with rage the employee gives my boyfriend and i a little smile and we both graciously thank her for making our shakes telling her how much we appreciate it whilst al stands off to the side fuming as we turn to leave we hear the second employee say we need to put more ice cream mix in the machine were all out which means it was going to be another minutes of freezing the new ice cream mix before al could get her shake zing tldr woman gets angry because she wants ice cream now is forced to wait because she was too lazy to put her order in herself and gets politely slammed by employee
so i was spending a friday night hanging at a local bar in my town when hambeasts having a bachelorette party came in and started stinking up the place keep in mind this is a pretty laid back bar in an upscale neighborhood not a dive or rowdy college bar or other such nonsense these women had a apparently come in from far out in the country they were fat smallest one was probably about obnoxious and drunk so im minding my own business when suddenly their group shifted and i found myself pressed against the bar and they have surrounded me me hello hambeasts you gotta buy us shots me what hambeasts yeah its random hambeasts bachelorette party buy us shahhhts at this point several of them had literally started chanting buy us shots buy us shots medeep sigh eye roll ok fine what do you want to drink hambeasts in unison patroooon me under breath fuck me normal voice okayyy told the bartender to line up patrons at that bar was likely shot then told the hambeasts hold on my friend should do these with us let me get him real quick they dont hear me theyve now got their sweaty meathooks wrapped around these glasses theyre practically salivating i walked towards the other end of the bar out the front door and never went back tldr hambeasts demanded free drinks i ordered up their drinks then left them with the bill 
i stopped at a mcdonalds a few months ago and decided to skip the long drive thru line and go inside it turned out that inside was even busier but im not in a hurry so its ok as im waiting for my food douche canoe dc comes in with his friend friend proceeds to order some food and wait alongside me dc proceeds cockily over to the soda machine with a cup from a chinese food restaurant and fills it up he saunters back over to his friend acting like he didnt just steal i walked back up to the register and asked how much a large soda was she said it was i pulled out the cash and she went to give me a cup i said its not for me its for him since he decided to fill his cup without paying the entire place turned to stare at dc and he proceeded to turn shades of red stumbling on his words saying i was going to pay etc the cashier laughed thanked me and insisted i take a cup and get myself a drink i got a sprite and it tasted like sweet sweet shaming revenge tldr dont fucking steal even if its from mcdonalds
to start i work at a amerixican fast food restaurant you know what it is youve probably gotten drivethrough there at one in the morning while drunk and thoroughly regretted that decision the following morning this chain to the unaware recently implemented their version of happy hour which just made our alreadybusy location even busier during what used to be the dead period from pmpm ive come to expect the lunch rush to last well into the afternoon and drivethrough customers will normally act accordinglytheyll know what they want state their order and drive through to get their food in a timely manner so the people behind them can get their food too cue car full of teenage girls at they pull up to the menu and begin by literally screaming into the microphone im still not sure what they screamed when they got there as blood had already begun pooling in my ear from the unholy screech but regardless of what it was it didnt leave a good first impression they then spend the next three minutes discussing with each other what they want and falling into fits of laughter while i sit there watching my speedofservice time creep higher and higher with nothing that could be done finally they order the line staff is prepped and ready for the sure onslaught of food these girls will want given the wait time on the order one taco and two small pepsis they spent four minutes in the middle of the day a line forming behind them to order of food they pull up to the window and pay their food is delivered and they drive away its too bad they were never told it was happy hour and that they could have gotten two medium drinks for a grand total of less than they paid for their two small drinks dont fuck with me

backstory my grandparents owned a stationery store that i grew up working in and when it closed down in we auctioned off all of our stock the couple that bought most of it also offered me a job which i took theyre great people but its the least organized workplace ive ever seen little by little ive been gutting and resetting sections of the store changes that go largely ignored but hey it gives me something to do anyway my latest project was to consolidate and organize all the envelopes if youve ever worked in a place that sells greeting cards youd know envelopes get pretty much everywhere there were stacks and piles and tote boxes of them everywhere last time we had a really slow day about months ago i went around and collected all of the envelopes literally thousands of them i put them all neatly into two unused stock drawers then i kinda forgot about it for a while in that time this one worker lets call her emma found my stash and started using it because well its hella convenient ive been told that once upon a time emma was a quite fastidious worker but sometime before i started she decided she was done cleaning up after everyone which apparently included herself she works opening and i work close and without fail every time i come in i need to spend upwards of half an hour cleaning up after her piles of boxes tossed in the back room that i need to take the garbage out of and flatten bills shoved into the register haphazardly notes for me to do tasks she could have done in less time it took to write said note and so on did i mention that emma had several boxes of envelopes that were marked emmas do not touch and those were the only envelopes in the store i didnt move yeah she abandoned those when she found my stash so the other day its slow enough for me to get back to my project first step was to separate the envelopes by company to be sorted by size and color so i pull out all the envelopes pick out the ones from a certain company and toss the rest back in the drawers haphazardly thats about as far as i get so i leave it like that during my days off i come back to find this note whoever made a mess in the envelope drawer please fix it so tired of cleaning up after everyone thanks emma of course how rude of me to work on my own project that i never said you could use in the first place maybe if i didnt spend an hour cleaning up after you that shift i wouldve had more time to clean up after myself so anyway i improvised a new step in my project packing all the cards in that drawer into tote boxes and hiding them in the back room a completely empty drawer is a clean one right update nothing came of this if i had to guess emma bitched me out to the owner who set her straight and nothing ever got to me

my mum was driving up to the sunshine coast to visit my brother who lives up there and saw she was low on fuel so she pulled into the service station and filled up when she came back out from paying she found her car wouldnt start she had been having a bit of trouble for a while so this wasnt a massive surprise cause she was blocking the fuel bowser she figured shed push the car out of the way and then try and fix the problem so she wasnt blocking anyone needing fuel so she walked back inside to ask the clerk behind the counter for help and this conversation goes down mum hey ive broken down do you recon i could get some help to push my car out of the way of the bowser clerk nah i cant im just too busy i dont have time a bit bewildered mum turned to walk out but a big burly biker she thinks around and around years old typical biker look says to her dont worry love ill give you a push but as their walking out of the story the biker knocks over a few of the cardboard cut outs and goes there mate see if you have time to pick those up and then walked out to help my mum push her car she tells me that she got a little warmth of happiness when she watched the clerk have to walk around and pick up the mess
i live in a dense residential area one of the other residents a few houses down from me has a dog who they like to walk past my house every day and every day that dog pees on the same tree right next to my front steps this normally wouldnt be a problem but i live in a city with very cold winters and what happens in the very cold winter is that the dog piss freezes before the ground can absorb it so day after day the dog pisses there which freezes and makes a giant disgusting deep yellow ice sheet that extends on to the sidewalk my girlfriend slipped on and almost fell into the piss sheet last week and i can only imagine how this is going to smell when it all melts in the spring youd think that when the piss sheet started to cover the sidewalk and created a public safety hazard the owner would consider taking their dog somewhere else to do its business nope well fortunately for me we got a ton of snow this week which covered up the mini pissrink next to my front steps i was happy to be done with it however not even an hour after the snow stopped falling the owner brought the dog back and started yellowing up all of the pretty snow literally on my front steps this time that was it id had enough that night after id been drinking beer all day thanks to a free snow day yay i went over to to the owners house and pissed all over the snow in front of their front steps i even made a few pretty patterns and i wont get too specific but lets just say that im a hell of a lot bigger than that little dog so thats how im going to deal with the problem from now on every time the owner treats my front steps like a fire hydrant im going to go over and treat his like a urinal is this the mature way to handle things not really but thats not what this sub is about
when i was a junior i switched from a small private school students to a huge new public school students i got along pretty well with most of my new classmates but as an introverted girl who hadnt yet discovered her inner geek i kept to myself a lot everything was going fine until a few weeks in during my fifth period class this scrawny sandyhaired kid named matt who sad behind me decided i would be his new target for fun and games all throughout class hed whisper nasty things to me loud enough so that his tall sidekick jeff who sat next to me could hear and for some others around us but not loud enough to disturb the class favorite things of his to whisper were yo bitch bitch im talking to you yo stupid bitch look at me come on bitch stuff like that he didnt really mock any one thing about me or call me ugly or anything hed just harass me with stupid comments and call me a bitch constantly throughout class at first i tried ignoring him but as we all know that useless parenting advice never works so i decided to step it up a notch and approached the teacher mr stevens after class i told him what was going on and hoped perhaps he could assign me to another seat since we had assigned seating no such luck his advice just try ignoring him literally that was it dumbass impotent fucking teachers i sucked it up for a couple more days but having seen me approach the teacher after class and seeing nothing had changed matt knew he was scottfree to say whatever he wanted so he stepped up his game finally after one particularly infuriating round of yo bitch while our teacher was in the middle of a lecture i just well snapped i stood up and mr stevens stopped midsentence to stare at me i started walking to the door mr stevens said speedycat where do you think youre going i replied well mr stevens im going to the principals office if you wont do anything about matts behavior i will as i walked out the door i was in the hallway before i fully realized what i had done i was in the hallway minus a hall pass which would have gotten me escorted to the principals office anyway so i figured regardless of what happened i knew where my next destination would be as i entered the principals office his secretary looked at me and asked me what i needed i need to speak to principal wilson i had to leave my class because i was being harassed so badly and my teacher mr stevens hasnt done anything about it so im here to see if he can help me let me tell you ive never been whisked into a principals office so politely and quickly i sat down and told the principal my story including how id just started at the school and how i was doing okay and fitting in but this one guy just would go off on me in this class while everyone around him just laughed i told him how id tried ignoring him and how id approached mr stevens but nothing was getting done after telling my story i was actually moved into a side room and asked to wait there throughout the period someone went off to fetch matt and get my books and bookbag which were brought back to me the bell rang and i was told i could go to my next class the matter was being handled the next class was the last of the day so i went home a bit of a nervous wreck not knowing what happened i told my dad about the incident in case the school called the next morning tall lanky jeff approached me right away at my locker his eyes were wide holy shit you got him suspended that was pretty fucking badass he actually admired me for standing up to this jerk i guess he definitely wasnt loyal to his friend and thought it was hilarious hed been suspended from school i showed up to mr stevens class to a notably absent seat behind me mr stevens never acknowledged that id left the day before or even apologized but he had clearly been spoken to as he was very professional and formal with me for the rest of the semester in that class anytime i came to him with a question for anything hed bend over backwards to help me as for matt he was put in a different class altogether once he returned from his brief suspension every time he passed me hed scowl but the rat bastard never said another fucking word to me again

last summer we arranged a camping trip at a local campground with a few friends and family we arrived and set up camp and noticed a group of campsites had all made a central area and were partying hard they were apparently guatemalan or costa rican i had trouble determining it from their accent but they were having a grand time we settled in and had a couple of beers and were enjoying the forest when suddenly their music got much louder and several people on bongo drums yes bongo drums started accompanying the music they were untalented but extremely enthusiastic musicians after about minutes of it i had had enough and wandered over to have a chat i speak decent spanish and asked them nicely to respect the other campers and the desire to enjoy the peace and quiet surprisingly they were good about it invited me to stay for a beer and were good neighbors until pm then am the rangers had finally had enough and shut them down during the am visit and they staggered off to bed at i get up very early its a veteran thing i had my coffee going and was enjoying my first cup at the sun rise was beautiful and thought provoking at precisely am i gathered up an empty ice chest a cd player and my coffee i sat the empty ice chest facing them turned backwards to it started up the cd of if i remember correctly was a van halen cd the most annoying thing i could think of and pounded out a bass drum accompaniment for the next minutes until my wife dragged me off with a horrified look as my neighboring campers who had been boozing and partying hard till were completely rousted from their beds petty but oh so satisfying 
a few weeks ago my new neighbors had a party on a sunday night their back screenporch faces mine with about yards separating the two the hoa does not allow fences so theres nothing but a few trees between us they seemed to get particularly loud at around in the morning no loud music but about of them laughing and trying to drunkenly talk over each other i couldnt be bothered to get dressed and walk over there so i flashed our patio light on and off several times which did nothing more than get some laughter out of them they carried on for at least another hour or so at which point i finally got back to sleep though my poor wife had to work the next morning i luckily had the monday off after having breakfast and getting dressed i went out back and at am on the dot i fired up the weedwhacker after half an hour or so of weedwhacking i got out the chainsaw and chopped some branches off one of my trees when i ran out things to do with my noisy tools i set up my bluetooth tailgate speaker on the back porch and listened to music for the next few hours my wife said i was being childish its been about a month and we havent heard a peep out of them at night since
this one is an unorthodox form of revenge though not from the food server but instead a dismayed observer so im out to dinner with some friends and one guy a friend of a friend is being a particular prick as a side note he is known as a real penny pincher a tight ass so to speak always asking for drinks asking for handouts and it turns out that this guy has been rorting our countrys australia welfare system for years i only recently found out so here we are at the restaurant table and he is being racist talking about hitler and using fake german accents in this hungarian restaurantin front of the friendly young hungarian waitress he is complaining about the menu and generally being rude to this poor waitress who is obviously new to the job a backpacker and just being nice whilst no doubt earning very little and not being tipped much we dont tip as much as people in the states so i tell him to stop being an asshole but he wont listen he continues we all as a group scold him for being a prick but he continues time passes and later the waitress brings his dinner which consisted of chicken schnitzel and chips at this point we are all happy because the food is great but of course he then decides to complain and ask the poor waitress to put the chips back in the frier because theyre not cooked enough and to get a new soda because it is diet not regular we sip the soda and all agree he is wrong id had enough pissed off at this guys lack of empathy most likely due to the fact he has never worked in hospitality in fact he doesnt work at all he relies on welfare payouts from the government i decide to seek revenge so as soon as i got home i wrote a long detailed submission to our welfare system dobin program it is basically a website where you can anonymously dob in welfare cheats hes toast i wrote everything i know about the guy including his boasts about rorting money i wrote his name his address his general m o from what ive heard etc feels good
 many many years ago im old sixth grade me was walking home from school during the wintery month of december i was not a popular child but even if i had been it wouldnt have mattered for there was this gang of eighth grade boys that were just jerks they picked on everyone and today during my cold walk home they decided to pick on me i had blocks to walk in the cold and snow to get home and for the entirety of those blocks those four jerks threw snowballs at me specifically at my face i couldnt run anywhere the snow in the yards was too deep so i had to walk with my head down slowly starting to cry while these four guys kept about twenty feet ahead of me constantly throwing snowballs by the time i got to the walk leading to my driveway i was a wreck tears and snot frozen to my face the inside of my jacket all wet from snow melting down the inside my dad was outside shoveling he saw what the boys were doing and started yelling at them to leave me alone they started to run and as they ran in frustration i bent down and picked up a large chuck of ice and salt and slush along the curb the kind of chunk that had fallen off a car i hurled this chunk in a large arc not at the boys just in the air in frustration the leader lets call him mike took this moment to stop turn around and start laughing ha ha coffeegorilla you puss im sure he was going to say pussy but i wouldnt know because that ice chunk i hurled into the air hit him directly in the face causing him to slip on the ice and fall on his back with a huge thunk immediately i felt better my dad started laughing and mike got up nose bloody and sort of screamcried at my dad to stop laughing at him which only made my dad laugh harder mike sort of shuffle ran home and my dad took me inside there is no way i could have hit mike if i tried as i am the least athletic person in the history of ever but hes the one who stopped to turn around for one last dig and put himself directly in the path of my ice chunk so perhaps this wasnt petty revenge but damnit if i dont smile when i think of it especially around christmas

i commute about hours to work on overcrowded trains today i was on a later train that had people packed in like sardines in the corridor i was in a narrow bit of the corridor along with the refreshments trolley normally it would move up and down the train selling craps sandwiches and lukewarm coffee and tea some hipster fuck who got on with us decided to sit on the floor and take up even more space one of my fellow commuters asked him to stand up because we were all crushed and he simply looked up and said no before putting his earphones in and turning his head perhaps its true that were all too polite in the uk as nobody said anything i then resolved to teach the twat a lesson for putting his own comfort over others if the chance presented itself my opportunity came at the last stop the refreshments trolley had to move due to the penultimate stop being on the other side of train so hipster fuck ended up blocked in by me and the trolley against the doors that wouldnt open i let about grinning commuters off before i let him out the best part was whilst i was doing that he tried shoving into me i was a fair bit taller than the little cunt and said can you move no i responded gleefully apologies for any spellingformatting errors im writing this on my phone on the return journey after a long day

a little bit of back story i attend a small college in ca and im a biochem major since my school is small for all of my core classes chembiomath i tend to see the same people every semester which is great because ive made a lot of friends and have a great study group im in my third year and since my first year ive had a lot of classes with this one girl that is an absolute brat she is rude to everyone all the time and is always trying to copy other peoples work etc last year i had her in my chem lab class and after a particularly rude encounter where she butt herself into a conversation with a friend of mine told me she didnt have time to do the prelab work which its not a lot of work and is really important if you want to be able to do well in the class and then basically demanded i stop what i was doing to help her out i flat out refused and made it a point to not let her sneak over and try and just copy my work for the rest of the semester even through she never stopped trying after this encounter my friends and i started referring to her as eb for entitled bitch end of back story its now fall semester and i got extra lucky this time around so my favorite people to study with are in the same class with me for the first week our professor had us set up person study groups on our online class section for various projects for the semester starting with a large group assignment of review work which will count for a decent chunk of points we are stoked and immediately sign up for a person study group with myself friend and friend so the next day we are sitting together and look online at our course and see that a person we dont recognize named jane has joined our group which is odd after some asking around eb comes running up to us with the biggest sly grin on her face and says hey guys yeah thats me in your group its clear by the look on her face she has joined our group specifically for the purpose of getting an easy a which annoys the hell out of my friends and i so were just like okay cool and go sit down for the lecture we have a week to do the assignment and so we make arrangements via email for each of us to work on specific parts and then meet up a few times to finish it up at school as we suspected eb doesnt respond or show up because at this point we know shes relying on us to just do the work and she can grab her free a so we do the work without her the day the assignment is due my friends and i are in class early to go over the assignment one more time with a group next to us and compare answers eb walks in about five minutes before the start of class and sits down in her usual spot in the back row we look back her and she says hey guys could you just write my name on there for me yeah this bitch is so lazy she cant even walk extra steps to sign her name on work she didnt even do now my friends and i were pretty annoyed with her but in that moment i had an idea winked at my friend and yelled back yeah we already got you girl youre good and shoot her a thumbs up lol fuck that noise we all fist bumped each other under the desks wrote just our names and turned that shit in without her my friend decided after class to let our professor know what happened after eb left and our professor agreed she shouldnt get credit grades arent back yet so it just warms my heart that for now eb still thinks she outmaneuvered me and got full marks on work she stole and she acts just so proud of herself for it enjoy your zero bitch edit wow this blew up after i went to bed thanks everyone and yes i will post an update i promise friends and i are just excited to finally see her reaction ourselves she has been a thorn on our side for too many semesters now also for such an update should i update this post or make a new post 
a few years ago when i was in comprehensive school high school for you nonbrits there was this horrible little kid called andrew he was your typical bully he would make sly remarks towards people trying to provoke them into fights he was constantly vying for attention from everybody due to his own insecure issues i assume everyday on the way home from school i would walk for about half a mile to this bus stop where i would sit and wait for my mother to come and pick me up it was the worst time of the day andrew and all his horrible friends would always walk past and feel the need to say something horrible to me to try and get me to react i would just ignore them as i was never the bravest outgoing kid and the idea of a fight really scared me one thursday he and his little group of social rejects decided to stop and intimidate me while i was at the bus stop they would do this from time to time there seemed to be no coherence to it they must of just got the urge to make my life miserable for those few minutes the usual insults started lanky nerdy gay this went on for a few minutes until andrew came up to my face and spat on me he had always been mean to people but i had never experienced anything like that before i had no idea how to react his friends were all egging me on the punch him as they clearly wanted to see him kick my ass but i was too in shock to really do anything they left shortly afterwards as i wiped my face furiously i got in the car with my mother when she arrived shortly after went home and locked myself in my bedroom and just cried i had never felt that humiliated and weak in my life the next day was a friday and we had to finish off our it coursework for that year for those of you who might not know it is basically a dumbed down version of computer science it involves a little bit of word and excel but nothing too strenuous the entire day was dedicated to us finishing this off and handing it in by the three oclock deadline i had already finished mine and just intended to sit around all day talking to friends andrew came into the class grunting something about how he couldnt be bothered to do anything and i overheard the teacher telling him that he hadnt even started yet and needed to work hard today i knew the teacher was going to give him all the answers and basic points he needed to pass as he was from a low income background and it would look really good on the teacher if he could get him to pass this wound me up but i figured there wasnt really anything i could do about it for the actual revenge itself you have to understand the type of school i went to to put it bluntly it was crap the it department was one room of about computers and the teacher was a pe gym teacher who took a weekend course in microsoft office nobody there knew how a computer worked and the concept of programming languages was above everyone i had meddled a little bit at home with computers but i was far from good at anything but i did know a few tricks as he was beginning his coursework typing out what the teacher had written for him i decided to try something i opened up the command line on a nearby computer and typed a shutdown command every computers name was written on a little sticky note on the monitor so i typed his in with the relevant syntax of course pressed enter and voila his computer shut down i was so happy he started ranting and raving and swearing he told the teacher but the teacher must of thought andrew was just being the little brat he was and making excuses not to work the nasty bully went on to try other computers but no matter which one he loaded up i kept shutting down his computer he was getting so furious and the brilliance was just amplified by the fact noone believed him this continued for the entire day i would sit talking to my friends notice he loaded up a computer and shut it down sometimes i would let him get a bit of his work done and then shut it down so everything was lost he would call the teacher over to watch how it kept happening but i would just back off and not do anything then when the teacher turned his back i would do it again at the end of the day everybody handed in their finished work and he had nothing to give in he got a for the entire course and out of gcses that he needed to get to pursue further education he got sometimes i feel bad for making him fail at the time i didnt know that this course was the difference between him passing and failing the entire year if i had known that i might not of done it but whenever i think about him spitting in my face and how humiliated i felt then this revenge always brings a smile to my face 
tldr got violent drug dealers arrested after shooting my tv via gas bombs i found this subreddit and i dont know where else to put this story i dont really consider it petty revenge but dammit if i dont get a warm and fuzzy feeling thinking about it after my second year in college a friend and i moved in with another friend he was renting a bedroom house in a lower income area so it was pretty cheap it was fairly close to the university campus and as all three of us were attending we were able to work it out where it would be a whole lot cheaper living there than on campus the neighborhood itself wasnt bad at all it was mostly other kids elderly folks and a few others here and there everyone in the neighborhood was pretty relax and chill except for our fucking neighbors well call them walter and jesse now walter and jesse were brothers and entrepreneurs of sorts they ran a small inhome business selling product in niche market that required very little advertisement they were meth cooks and dealers obnoxious loud violent drug dealers everyone hated them but nobody would say anything about it due to the constant threats they would make while strung out from there front yard we pretty much fell in line at first they would blast music and porn from there house from am until am wed hear screaming matches at there house that became full blown fights on their lawn huge fucking parties that would go on for days and to our chagrin we ignored it all well up arrives march and my income tax comes in i only get about but goddammit thats my dollars and im gonna fucking buy something for me everything has gone to college and bills and i want to splurge i go out and buy a lcd tv its a vizio but its the first hdtv ive ever had my friends and i set it up and oh boy did we have fun that week and only that week for thats as long as i had it the meth bros decide theyre gonna shoot their bb gun at whatever the fuck they can see at birds bushes fences and especially windows well one little bb decided to go straight through my window and hit my tv cracking it while i was playing some mw my face dropped and i heard laughing which then immediately turned to death threats if i called the cops now i know they had real guns they had no issue showing them to anyone who looked at them my friends and i were all disappointed at the turn of events and both of them had submitted to not doing anything about it but nay not i the one time i purchased me a bit of joy in my life i grew up fairly poor it was taken away from me so i plotted and i plotted and i plotted some more and an evil plot i did accomplish i saved up every gatorade bottle i purchased for about weeks and every other day i would go to a different store and purchase pool cleaning tablets and rubbing alcohol at a different one all with cash of course now some of you might see whats going and youd be right i had about bottles saved up and i made some spectacular chlorine gas bombs i waited for a night when both of them were gone it was about three in the morning so virtually everyone was asleep i had prepared the gatorade bottles with the alcohol prior so i started loading the tablets into the bottles and throwing them over the fence since i didnt break down the tablets it took a while for them to go off i was able to get them all over the fence before the first one went boom and boom they went i go back inside and into my room i hear them going off boom boom one of my roommates wakes up and goes what the fuck boom he wakes my other roommate his room was closer and there both freaking out boom time to put my game face on i scramble on out of there and react visibly scared boom i look at them and tell them to call the cops boom boom he calls and tells the cops he hears explosions i go outside and pretend to look like im trying to find out whats going on boom i tell my friend that its coming from next door boom he tells me that the cops have already been sent to the area by a previous caller boom boom i tell him theres a bunch of smoke coming from outside boom they tell us to stay inside boom the last one goes off we close the doors and watch the mayhem unfold right before the cops come the heisenbros show up freaking out right as they go inside about cop cars show up and go through the front door the officers haul them away and we go outside they question us we tell them what we know as far as the chlorine gas is concerned it has already wafted into the atmosphere they came back a couple days later and asked us questions specifically about the brothers we told them what we heard about them and how they acted what they did the officer left and that was the last time i talked about it nobody knows about what i did but me and it was the happiest weve been in a long time the last i heard about them they were doing hard time for their drug ring being in possession of illegal firearms and human trafficking suprisingly edit spelling edit what half the comments seem to be about my 
my aunt was an extreme hypochondriac and newagealtmedicine wacko she actually died of treatable cancer because she believed her prayer warriors would pray the cancer away and that doctors are evil but thats a story for another day im just trying to explain her mentality anyways like nutjubs are wont to do whatever new craze was going around she was on board with it regardless of its scientific validity at the time that this story took place the myth of msg being bad for you was going around and guess who was making sure to announce loudly and repeatedly at every given opportunity that shes allergic to msg it wasnt that she said it once or twice that my dad would have let go but with my aunt it was like an obsession like she would just shoehorn that piece of information into any conversation where it could remotely fit oh you went to the football game the other day i love football too but i cant eat any of the stadium food because it all has msg and im so allergic to it now we had had my aunt and uncle over for supper numerous times and many of those times my father had seasoned the food steak stir fry etc with msg all those previous times she ate it not even knowing it was there and suffered no ill effect whatsoever after her going on for half a year about her imaginary msg allergy my father reached the breaking point with her bullshit and hatched a plan to shut her up he invited her and my uncle over for supper and put copious amounts of msg in everything and said nothing about it predictably aunty inhaled the meal with great zeal and proceeded to praise my fathers cooking ability or hours into the evening and well into the cocktails my father asked her how she was feeling i feel great and im having a lovely time to which my father replied im so happy to hear that because i put lots of msg in the meal and i was worried it might affect you it was like a page turning in a book happy aunty feeling great suddenly started to go red in the face she started clutching her left arm and broke out in a profuse sweat uncle jumped up and started fanning her with a magazine until her symptoms and embarrassment went away over the course of short minutes unsurprisingly she never again mentioned her allergy to msg
i work at a local burger joint in a very affluent and entitled area just outside of chicago like these people live in a bubble here at my work everything is made to order so when you order through the drive thru you still have to wait a while but drive gets top priority since there is this wait we usually ask cars to park along side the restaurant and give them a number for their order i was supposed to be working the register meaning they basically want me tethered to the damn thing it was raining pretty heavily and the food runners were mia the kid on drive hurt his ankle the day before and asked me to run the food out im kind of annoyed since the runners are missing and theyve got our rain jackets so i have run out and get soaked i run out and this woman is sitting on her cellphone so i tap her window to get her attention she holds up a finger to tell me to wait in the rain when she rolls her window down i read back in the most basic of terms her order like cheeseburger meal she takes the bag and then asks me to clarify the toppings while im getting soaked and then argues with me about what the works entails then there was an issue with the damn dipping sauce im already pretty wet at this point so i tell her ill run and grab the correct sauce for her oh thats okay i was going to go inside anyway what the fuck i run back in ready to rain down the rage who the fuck goes through the drivethru and then goes inside to eat this was only an hour after we opened were not busy theres no wait and theres clearly only one car in our parking lot employees park elsewhere since i am on register guess who gets to help her when she comes up to order dessert we have coupons circulating right now for bogo sundaes our registers arent the best and cant determine the lower priced sundae to take off so the second one is always the one thats free im usually nice and take off the higher priced one but she wanted a two scoop premium sundae with nuts costs extra and a one scoop i charged her about two dollars more by taking off the one scoop please stop trying to guess where i work not really relevant and none of them have been right

early in my relationship with my wife then gf we did the long distance thing she had a two bedroom apartment but was living by herself then one of her friends needed a place so she offered up her second room i was down every other weekend and since i was working i paid the cablephoneinternet bills and always bought groceries mainly for my wife but the roommate benefited from that as well the roommate happened to be dating a good friend of mine and he usually stayed there a couple nights a week despite having an apartment not too far away about months into this arrangement and after returning home to massive parties several times we received a note on my wifes bedroom door it read shortened version shanel must pay rent and bills since he regularly stays here i would like that amount to be returned from this months and last months rentbills my wife was definitely annoyed and shocked that she would make demands she was even more shocked that she wanted those demands to be retroactive my wife decided to write up the greatest response letter ive ever read it said dear roommate i have considered your demands and have decided that it would only be fair if we both charge our house guests for their stays i also do not think it is fair that shanel pays our month cablephoneinternet bill and still has to pay to stay when he visits while your guests do not so i have included that bill in my calculations rent is month bills are month we each paid month as per our previous arrangement the new and more fair arrangement would see an increase of to the total amount with the addition of the cablephoneinternet bill that is a total of month or day in bills on days when there are three of us staying here that is about person per day days when there are four of us staying here it will be person last month shanel stayed here days for a total of he owes us this month he will be here days for a total of he will pay for staying here last month roommates boyfriend stayed here days owing us and this month he has already stayed here days owing us your parents stayed for days last month and since there were two of them the amount per person per day is since there were four of us staying here that equals your mom is staying with us for days next week for a total of so that leaves us with our portions since we are responsible for the entire month that means our portion is day when there is only of us here day when there is three of us here and day when there is of us here last month there were only of us here for days each of us here for days each for our portion and of us here for days each for our portion our total portion for last month is each this month there will be only of us for days each of us for days each for our portion a total of each since we are responsible for our guests i will include their totals to our portions and you can collect from them however you like and i will collect from shanel that brings your total from last month to bf parents my total is shanel this month your current total is mom bf my total is shanel since you already paid last month and this month you only owe which you can collect from your guests please have the money by the end of next week thanks needless to say she completely expected her roommate to move out after reading that they had been having some arguments leading up to this whole event so the roommates note was the final straw for my wife the problem is her roommate waited until rent day to give her notice that she was moving out that day expecting to get away with paying the next months rent and leaving it all on my wifes shoulders while my wife was at school her roommate moved her stuff out without a mention of where she could be reached so my wife called her roommates parents and explained the situation about a week later giving her roommate enough time to resurface that same night her roommate returned and paid her needless to say they are no longer friends one night shortly after we were at my friends house her bf for a party and i jokingly handed him and said in case your gf wants us to pay cover for visiting you that was the first time he had heard the story as far as he was aware we just decided to increase her rent month for no reason once i explained it to him we had a good laugh and i came to find out he was in the process of breaking up with her as it turns out she moved in with him and tried freeloading he kicked her out the day before the party and hadnt spoken to her since tldr roommate demanded money from houseguest who was already paying bills roommate didnt realize she had guests more often and it was explained to her using math in a way that showed she owed more money by her own logic the intention of the lesson was to kick her out note this was going to be a comment to the following reddit article but it was too long

i live in korea where most people take public transportation and there are taxis everywhere one day i was running quite late so instead of walking the minutes to my destination from the subway station i decided to ride a cab now one of my biggest pet peeves is rude taxi drivers seriously im paying you im your customer and you want to treat me like shit out of any industry in my country i feel like taxi drivers have the most freedom to be downright rude because the customer cant choose to pay any less from the fare there is no tipping culture here and its also highly unlikely that the same customer will ride again anyways ive had my share of rude taxi drivers in the past but being shy and passive i always let it slide this particular time though this guy was so rude and i was already late so i didnt just let it slide there are designated places where cabs line up and customers know where to go for a cab i hurried over to such a place and there were cabs as is fair i went into the cab at the front this old guy asks me where i want to go the place im going is really a nook underground in between buildings and probably doesnt even have an address even if it did i wouldnt know it so i said the general direction and said i would give directions he said just give me the address and tapped the navigation system impatiently i said i dont know the address but its close by and i know the exact way ill give you directions he refused asking me for the address again raising his voice i told him once again that i dont know and ill be giving directions at this point im getting pretty pissed because this guy is wasting my time and im already late as fuck then this guy just starts yelling at me saying you think you know these streets better than me young lady ive been driving a cab for years how dare you just give me the address how could you not know at this point im flabbergasted and really pissed so without replying i just got out of the cab and stomped with as much might as i could muster in my heels clip clopping all the way to the next cab only a few feet away haha and got in everyone on the sidewalk which was quite a crowd since it was a major intersection in front of a university stared and i kinda felt strangely proud the new taxi driver seemed a bit surprised but asked where i was going i told him i would give him directions and he just sped off instantly he was also super nice and friendly the entire ride this taxi driver was seriously so nice lt bonus is that i purposely didnt close the rude taxi drivers door so he had to get out from his drivers seat on the left side walk all the way around his car and shut the door in the back right he was pretty embarrassed especially with the crowd staring at him and just drove away from his spot which hed probably been waiting at for a while as an even pettier bonus as we drove past him i flicked him off
this is not human revenge i had no part in this i bought my two dogs rawhide bones yesterday a big one for ruger the mastiff and a small one for molly the terrier mix for the last few years whenever these two get treats ruger would steal mollys and eat hers up pretty quick as usual ruger steals hers molly barely complains she grabs his and goes to the door to be let out i see her run off to the woods with his bone a few minutes later she starts barking so of course ruger wants to see whats going on he drops mollys bone on the living room rug when i go to let him outside molly starts scratching at the front door so i walk to the other freakin side of the house to let her back in she doesnt have rugers bone instead she goes straight for her own half chewed one there on the rug when i let ruger in he looks confused and kinda sad but he sighs and lays down and doesnt do much about it molly finishes off her bone just before bedtime this morning after i let them outside to go potty molly comes back inside with rugers bone shes laying next to me right now with it ruger looks absolutely defeated edit its about nine at night now ruger managed to steal the rawhide back molly is taking out her frustration by violently humping him sigh editedit asekmusik was talking about this picture of quit down voting him thanks

there was a time in my life when i worked for a rental car company i had worked my way up the ranks and was comanaged one of the largest locations for about miles we were one of the only locations that had specialty vehicles like cargo vans pick up trucks passenger vans etc and we only had a handful of each usually customers were okay with this granted this meant that customers had to book these vehicles far enough in advance and plan to come and get these specialty vehicles usually people had some notice when they were going to need to transport people or something like that so we never encountered too many problems until my lucky day with the biggest asshole i had ever encountered in this job for some reason people tend to get really upset very quickly in the rental car industry and i imagine this expands into the rest of the travel world this guy however really outdouched every other customer i had ever dealt with this man who i will refer to as mr yellowteeth needed a cargo van to replace his own cargo van that had been damaged by hail insurance replacement vehicles are common in rental so it was not a huge deal to move some shit around and make a cargo van available for him for at least a week but mr yellowteeth had some very specific requirements he would not have his vehicle repaired at the body shop a half a mile away from us that his insurance adjustor suggested no mr yellowteeth was going to take his van to a body shop forty five minutes from my location and he would need to be picked up yeah no im not sending someone that far one of my employees is gently explaining that yes we will pick you up if you are within miles of our location mr yellowteeth hangs up on this kid after shouting ill find my own way then wont i so loudly that i could hear him on the other side of the office my employee and i laugh about because ha ha people are assholes at this point im not sure if this guy is even going to show up for his reservation well mr yellowteeth shows up for his res and i swear to god the hairs on the back of my neck stood up my mind and my body knew that the guy walking in my doors was going to be a real piece of shit and that i would end up being the one helping him my gut was right because he walks right up to me and says you people have my van boy i love when customers say you people the whole team just loves that so in my most professional and patient voice i get this process started then we get to the point where i ask for a form of payment for a fully refundable deposit which is when part of the freakout begins what do you mean i need to give you a deposit this shit aint my fault i aint paying for nothing no one aint never tell me about no deposit and on and on we go even though we had just talked to this guy about bringing in a credit card so finally i say fine sir i will waive this deposit for you once so next comes the part where i ask if he wants to cover this car with the company you know rental car insurance it was a time of year when hail was a real possibility obvs this guys personal cargo van had gotten pretty mutilated by it and he already made a claim on his businesss insurance and paid the deductible mr yellowteeth laughs in my face tells me all kinds of rude things like you damn leeches look for any way to suck the money of out people like me and on and on so i just chalk up this customer as a loss and attempt to show him some of the features of this brand new cargo van he tells me that no woman can show him something on a car that he cant figure out himself so at this point im over this motherfucker and done with my day i walk back in to fume with my coworkers for a moment and keep my eye on mr yellowteeth in the parking lot hes talking on his cell phone and moving stuff from his rides car into his rental cargo van he wasnt paying too much attention to what he was doing he started the van turned around put stuff in the back closed the doors talk talk talk and then uh oh he closed the driver door he tries to open it again still on his phone but surprise this new cargo van has automatic locking doors i had planned to show him how to disable this feature but well you know im just a woman its really hard for my coworkers and i to hide our combined glee as we watch mr yellowteeth have a meltdown in the parking lot there are other customers in our office so we have to keep it as professional as we can of course mr yellowteeth comes in all red faced and blotchy and starts going off about the locked doors i cant help myself i have to needle at him so i tell him well sir i did offer you the roadside assistance that would have covered a locksmith to come out and open the door for you but you declined it was like pouring gasoline on a fire he keeps going on and telling us that we set him up and whatever so my comanager and i grab a coat hanger and decide to jimmy this bitch open weve done this before for several other cars that an employee accidentally locked the keys in so after about minutes of fiddling and jamming and jimmying around we get the door unlocked mr yellowteeth who stood there watching the whole time didnt even say thank you he just walked straight to the van climbed inside grabbed his cell phone slammed the door and shifted into gear leaving my comanager and i standing in the parking lot with fuck this place looks on our faces just as im about to turn around to go back inside i see mr yellowteeth in my white ford cargo van attempting to make an impossible turn in a parking lot full of rental cars and customer cars and crunch my ford cargo van was about feet longer than his own van and he miscalculated a tight turn out of our parking lot swinging the tail end of the cargo into one of the newer fleet escalades that cost upward of i couldnt help it i lost it i laughed so hard i had to hide in the wash bay for ten minutes while i had one of the best stomach rumbling laughs id had in years while my comanager filed a claim with his insurance 
almost five years ago i was unemployed and sitting at home the phone started ringing some middledaged man asked to speak to my boss and when i say ask i mean ordered me to connect him to my boss like the drone he obviously thought i was no please no how do you do not even a hello so i tell him i dont have a boss that this is a private residence and that he made a wrong number completely ignoring me he went on a rant on how he was a very important person and that he had something equally important to talk about with my boss and then reiterated his request so i just hung up i was busy doing nothing and this rude person interrupted me so naturally the moron immediately calls back before i can say anything he immediately goes in an angry diatribe on how hell have my job my head and my house or something like that he was apparently so important he didnt have to bother with being very clear i hung up again needless to say this went on and on i could not just unplug my phone because i expected some calls from my future employers and i didnt have a cell phone back then i was basically a pleb should i have called the police nay this called for a revenge of the petty persuasion so every time mr importantcouldnotpossiblybemistaken would call i would put the phone on a mp player with only one song in it a french folk song entitled la grosse bite dudule or dudules big dick in english yeah believe me its as stupid rude and gross as it sounds and more oh and worst of all its catchy mr important was not happy to be introduced to my musical culture as soon as the lyrics started getting vulgar he would scream at the tops of his lungs i could hear him even though the phone was three feet away from me after two weeks of this treatment and as i was considering replacing the tune with a recording of me and and three of my buddies singing other crass songs in canon with a fourth friend playing the flute in the background because fuck that guy mr important suddenly stopped calling never heard from him ever again maybe he finally understood how phone numbers work

so this is a pretty short story but once upon a time i used to work customer service in retail a particularly unpleasant customer came through the register while on his phone i waited for him to get off the phone to serve him which was evidently a grave offence he got irritated and just threw his credit card at me in order to start the transaction i had already been annoyed by his being rude enough to come through while on the phone and not say a word to me so i picked his credit card up threw it back at him and said lets try that again from the start he just about had a heart attack lost his temper at me and threw his card at me again so i threw it out the door and told him i was refusing him service and if he came back id call the cops which was a bit more plausible as this was a bottleshop fortunately he did leave swearing all the way cos even though my boss was pretty cool he could have made some trouble for me if hed complained but it was totally worth it 
okay so my brother evidently doesnt understand how cereal works every morning ill come downstairs to find my cereal sitting out with the bag still wide open letting in all the air that ruins the satisfying crunch of a perfectly good box of frosted cheerios i always put it away and tell him to at least roll the bag up if he eats my cereal he doesnt he was out of town all weekend and just got back last night when he left saturday morning he left my cereal box open shocker so instead of putting it away and scolding him yet again i brought into his room left it open and turned on his humidifier last night before he got back i closed it up and put it back in the cupboard this morning i got up early and waited for the bastard to open my cereal slowly he pops the tabs and folds them back his greedy pale fingers reach in and i hear the bag begin to rustle and crinkle next the clanking of musty oshaped oats tumble into his bowl percent milk splashes down upon them and he takes a bite out of his dark silver spoon he immediately spits out and screams eww this shit is stale youre goddamn right it was tldr brother leaves my cereal open all the time so i tricked him into eating stale cereal
i was at a mountain in lake tahoe this winter with my husband for a nice day of snowboarding at this particular lift the approach to get onto it is a little bit of an organized chaos method where people just bunch together and then squeeze down further and further as they inch forward until it becomes a line my husband and i got into the bunch and then i bent over to buckle the clasp on one of my boots as i do this a woman on skis inched her way in front of me in the bunch since it wasnt an official line and it was just one person i decided to let it pass as it was a quad lift and wed all be able to take the same chair up anyway but then she turns around and waves to someone behind her while turning to me and says you broke up our group were just joining back together so we can get to the top at the same time i watched dumbfounded as no less than six other people pushed their way past my husband and i as they joined up with this woman and two of the kids actually scraped their skis over my board as they passed by i couldnt believe it they set us back two whole chairs just because this woman wanted to get in front of two people i didnt want to get into a dumb i was here first argument so i took it to the streets three of her family members got onto a chair and then she and the rest of her group were waiting for the next one to come around i was directly behind the woman so as she got ready to slide forward in front of the chair i took my free unbuckled boot and stood on the back of her ski she lurched forward and immediately fell on her face they ended up having to stop the lift for a few seconds as she got back up i profusely apologized and she had no time to do anything but get red in the face and get on the lift petty revenge was served cold with a face full of snow
im renting a home that has an oil heating system underneath the house accessible by a small crawl space located outside of the home last year there was a major incident where the oil filter failed and leaked nearly gallons of oil into the soil this was a huge disaster that required cleanup efforts by the epa the ground underneath my house had to be excavated wells were dug and my landlord was concerned they would have to bulldoze the house last winter everything was finally cleaned up we got a clean bill of health from the epa and my heat was restored fuck yeah i was glad to be done with it fast forward to this afternoon its the first snow of the season and i get woken up by my dog going apeshit hearing a ruckus underneath the house i work nights i look outside and see an oil truck in my front yard from a company i dont recognize the usual maintenance guys from the oil company are friendly and professional this turned out to be both a subcontractor and an asshole so i put my dog on a leash and walk around the side of the house to find out wtf is going on i see the door to the crawl space is open and theres some guy doing maintenance to the system from my perspective its hard to see whats going on since the area is so confined you have to get on your hands and knees outside the house to crawl through the maze of ducting and other shit to get to the furnace i say afternoon whats going on in my opinion this is perfectly reasonable question to ask some dude pulling my heating system apart without so much as a knock on the door or a phone call i have the contract with the heating company not the landlord even if it was common practice to do unannounced maintenance the guy was a total dick about it long story short hes rude as hell sarcastic and basically tells me to fuck off clearly my pound westie had heard enough of his shit because in the midst of this guys tirade he takes a massive shit of his own right in the doorway of the crawl space there is simply no way to get out from underneath the house without crawling on your hands and knees through my dogs steaming pile of petty revenge i fucking love my dog

worked at a school system a couple of years back and had my share of grumpy faculty members one lady was always calling for very little things like simple paper jams on her desktop laser printer when she didnt bother to switch between card stock and plain paper settings etc shed always berate the it staff in front of her class as we worked playing up to the students about how it would be nice if the school had people who could keep things running how we had everything set up ergonomically incorrect etc you know the kind anyway i was finishing up doing some work while she insulted the it dept yet again and noticed she had a highly prized vga cable running the ft from her screen to her pc this lady wore reading glasses but didnt want to wear them at her computer because they dont look good on me so she had conned one of the techs into giving her the longer cable so she could pull the screen as close to her face as possible when she went to lunch i swapped the cable with a ft cable and stretched the thing as tight as i could pulling the lcd back against the wall i then took the cable to the digital media teacher as the principal had asked me to find one for him minutes later she came into my lab interrupting a class yelling about how i messed up her monitor and that she couldnt pull it forward i just told her that i had been asked by the principal to allocate that cable elsewhere and that her screen was now ergonomically correct as it was from her face edit misspeeling
backstory im a very average guy not fat but could use to lose a few pounds not ugly but im not brad pitt either im not rich but i have however managed to earn a good living in the tech industry most people describe me as a nice average guy i went back to the little town in pennsylvania where i grew up to see some old friends its a hour drive so i made sure i plenty of time and arrived at the bar a little early while i was waiting for my friends very good looking women sat down at the bar next to me being bored and wanting to kill some time i struck up a conversation with them no lines and nothing that could be construed as hitting on them nothing more than hi cool place huh it took the redhead about seconds to shut me down as she said to her friend i guess i wasnt good looking enough and they were out of my league i was told i shouldnt bother even trying and that they werent going to waste their time at this point i just chuckled and turned my back i dont care who you are or how hot you are everyone should be treated with a basic level of respect and decency the next time the bartender walked over i asked him to give everyone in the entire bar a round on me except for the women that were so rude to me by the time my friends arrived at the bar i was best buddies with almost everyone in there and the bitches were left at the bar alone the bar tab was north of but it was worth every penny
i was told to take this here after posting it it was a wonderful moment in my life gtthis is unrelated but a good story that i love to tell when it comes to traffic justice issues gtthe bus terminal in my suburban neighbourhood is on top of a really big hill at the top of a valley the lights onto the street that goes over the hill at the intersection with the terminal have bus activated lights so they only change if a bus is waiting to leave gtone day i got on to go to school and the bus pulls up to the lightyellowredand the bus starts to pull out about halfway into the intersection this primped up older not old enough to justify this stupidity lady ploughs through the intersection in some fancy new cadillac gtthe bus driver lays on the horn and slams on the breaks and the woman in the car flips her off on a red light gtthe woman driving the bus curses her out and carries on we go down the hill into the valley and there is another intersection this is often a place police set up speed traps and sure enough that day they did gtwho should be pulled over on the cross street on the right fancy cadillac lady the bus driver gets excited pulls the bus over and calls a cop over she says did she get caught for speeding and the cop says she sure did and the bus driver responds is running a red light still illegal here the cop laughs sure is hands her his cardare you willing to testify in court gtthe bus driver laughs and says honey i get paid a days wage to go to court for these things it would be my pleasure gtthen the front of the bus who heard the exchange starts clapping gtit was awesome
i live in a state where youre not allowed to pump your own gas theres a gas station around the corner from my home that i often frequent mainly because its convenient but also it has some of the lowest prices in the area even if by only a cent or two problem is the one guy they have pumping gas is a total ass hat hes slow hes rude and he doesnt care about his job one time the price on the sign wasnt the price that was on my receipt and when i pointed it out he argued with me for a few minutes and then told me to go talk to the manager inside if i wanted my so i pulled out my infant and toddler and trekked into the store in forty degrees i could have dropped it but i wanted to make a point and tell the boss what a dick his employee was being this guy will wait in his little booth for at least a minute before coming out and acknowledging me and he has refused me service in the past my husbands car has some issues with filling the tank and he would have to actually hold the nozzle instead of leaving it in or it stops he was feeling particularly lazy that day i suppose we were the only ones there its always the same ass attendant the other day i was running low on gas and was on my way home from running errands with the kids it was the last time i planned on going out in the car and figured i would fill up so i had a fresh tank for the morning so i begrudgingly slid into the empty gas station and parked i saw him in his booth when i pulled up to the pump he didnt budge i didnt turn my car off i sat there and waited and waited at least two minutes have gone by when he finally decided to actually do his job and get up he walked out of his booth he approached my car then i drove off 
this blonde curly haired very tan woman walked through the gate with a full head of steam like she owned the place she was stressed because she didnt have the time for anything making it everyone elses fault she goes by the name butch my coworker is from mexico and she is still learning english shes a sweet as sugar old lady but her accent is as thick as the sugar cane fields in the dominican republic she goes by clara butch hops into claras line without even thinking clara is having trouble understanding her butch gets very angry so she hops into my line when she reaches the front of the line she starts muttering racist comments under her breath while looking me in the eye for my approval and periodically glancing over at clara i ignore her comments trying not to give her any satisfaction but her thick skull prevails and shes satisfied with her rant about illegals not knowing how to speak american she moves on to complain about how her landscaping customer is now costing her money without skipping a beat i say well thats no bueno she slowly lifts her head up her eyes meet mine i can see the looks of fear anger panick and confusion cycle through her eyes giving distinction to each emotion her face had told me everything she had been thinking in under a second her racism had not gotten through to me clearly i had the thicker skull and my words alone had punctured hers with a final fit of anger she looked at me and said no no you mean its no good no good i speak american the thing is i had been using the phrase no bueno for a while now to sort of spice up my vocabulary when butchs face told me that i hadnt been paying attention to one single phrase of racism her face spat at me it clicked i realised i had stabbed her with the blade of petty revenge without even thinking about my approach almost as if petty revenge was second nature to me petty revenge was coursing through my veins feels good man
last year i took the train home after bringing my husbands car into service station as i live one station from the airport i chose a good time and thought it wouldnt be that crowded i was surprised to find the whole train nearly empty a few minutes later a guy entered the train with a whole bunch of luggage there were like huge bags and suitcases and by the sweat on his forehead i could tell it was a heavy load i offered my help but he would refuse he was arranging his luggage so everyone could easily pass by what took him a good two minutes credits for that as he was finally sitting down in the opposite cabin the train ran into the next station and i see an elderly lady with a kid entering the coach the woman approached the guy pointed to a small sign that said handicapped people only and claimed the seats saying she was handicapped she started flipping off the guy in a very rude way the guy instantly got up when i chimed in and offered my seat for them i also pointed at all the unoccupied seats in the coach but the woman wouldnt even look at me and kept claiming the seats i felt sorry for the guy and this time he accepted my offer to help him move the luggage i was boiling inside and i couldnt believe my eyes when she stood there for a whole minute watching us move the bags instead of sitting down with the kid the woman mentioned the airport a few times so i thought it would be their destination i dont know why i didnt get out when i arrived at my stop but my guts told me id miss something and it was maybe my time to shine in a petty revenge so i stayed for the airport stop and helped this guy bringing all the luggage to the door when the door opened he jumped out and i passed him one suitcase after another and hell some of them were pretty heavy about of the bags were out when i heard the lady nagging behind me let me out of the train youre blocking me and my kid to which i replied with use another door then or wait old lady she yelled at me and started pushing me which makes me fucking furious i hate people pushing near trains and tracks but i kept passing the bags to the guy as clumsy as one possibly can and told her to shut up i knew the train wouldnt wait forever and when the last bag was out i heard the annoying beep of the doors which indicated the train was about to depart the kid and i hopped out and the lady was so busy with her rant she didnt notice she was probably expecting someone miraculousy to show up who says something like yeah you fucking old lady i got your back here the doors shut and once theyre shut theres no way back the train slowly departed and i was in shock i mean i didnt expect that i just wanted to delay her getting off the train by acting clumsy but then i noticed the kid and the luggage guy laughing hard next to me i started laughing too and the woman in the train was pounding the glass gasping and i will never forget her swollen red face of anger and rage oddly no horror or fear we talked to the kid and i took him to a cafe where he called his mom which wasnt the woman in the train and she came shortly after to pick him up the kid told her the story and exaggerated a little too much casting the care taker in a very negative light and thats basically how this woman lost her job im still in contact with the kids family as we found out were actually neighbours fun fact the woman was far away from being handicapped she was just a lazy twat who liked to harrass other people fun fact i chose the cafe next to the escalator so we could see this care taker to come back with the next train to search for the year old kid shes responsible for lady kept noshow what kind of person does that tldr care taker harrasses a guy in a train gets petty revenged by blocking her way out and ends up departing with the train while the kid shes in charge of stays at the airport train station edit typo and some additional fact at the end 
a little bit of relevant background when i was im now i was irresponsible and racked up a bunch of overdraft charges on my checking account and let it close and go to collections i owed something like dollars and ended up paying it off all at once when i was fast forward to last week i get a call from a restricted number i answer it and am essentially told that there is a warrant out for my arrest in the county i reside in and that i am being summoned to court and im given a number to call for more info so i call the number an overlypolite woman answers and i begin asking questions im alarmed but beginning to smell something fishy essentially she tells me that she represents a law firm and that they are attempting to sue me for that i apparently owe from the aforementioned bank account the one i paid off years ago if i dont find a way to pay or optin to one of their convenient pay plans they will mark me as noncompliant and send a sheriff to arrest me i calmly ask for the name of the law firm she represents and she gives the name to me i tell her i need to check the funds in my account to see what i can do and that ill call her back so after looking up the name of the law firm i find out that its a real large firm with many attorneys on hand and that it does deal to some extent with debt collection suits i call the number on the companys website and am told that a my name isnt in their system b the number i was originally given isnt one of their numbers and c the original call is definitely a scam and not to worry about it the revenge first things first i reported the caller to the ftc and my states attorney generals office shouldve been good enough right nope i needed to do something more petty so i called the number back and then i proceeded to talk to them for almost hours i just played dumb and poor i couldnt find the right card i kept putting them on hold for up to minutes at a time so i could make sure theres enough money in this account lets try this card now each time giving them random nonexistent card numbers card didnt work oops i gave you the wrong expiration date wait wheres the expiration date again oh it must have been the wrong zip do you take personal checks hold on let me see if i have any the icing on the cake was before i got off the call i asked it they accepted western union oh yes of course we do she seemed real excited about that idea untraceable cash so i had her walk me through the process and miraculously my debit card worked on wus site so i gave her a bogus control number and she told me shed call back once the money was picked up about an hour later my phone started blowing up from the number i just smiled and blocked it tldr debt collection scammers try to scam me i report them to the ftc and state attorney general and then waste hours of time with them on the phone playing stupid and send them to western union with a bogus control number
years back i had to run in to my store to check the alarm late one night no big deal part of the job so i hop into my sweet ride and drive the ten minutes to do so this involves some onelane roads a stretch of twolane quasiresidential area known for its strict enforcement then back down to one lane this becomes important shortly foreshadowing i check the building everythings fine ah well back to bed i hop back in the car crank up the radio and head home on the way back i pick up a seemingly drunk tailgater on the onelane portion yay aggressive little cuss flashing lights weaving encouraging me in no small ways to getoffthedamnroad we end up at the red light where the road becomes split in twain astride each other and he gets all middlefingery and revvy i pettily encourage this behavior because i have some very recent inside information a speed trap a halfmile hence the light goes green he goes byebye i take my own sweet time and sure enough the trap is sprung i wave jauntily as i pass by the pulledover drunk doing the speed limit
so my previous job i had a set of draws under my desk which i would store pens food and other items food was either dry so unlikely to go off or something id made the night before and would move to the fridge if i decided to be a fussy git and get something else for lunch for some time my food if left in my draw over the weekend would either be partly eaten or completely eaten with my desk being made a mess of and my seat set for my back and pelvis issues adjusted i had complained to the only teams manager who would be in over the weekend but of course no one is going to own up to stealing so no one was punished and it would continue now i have a chronic fissure for the gents out there who have just sucked air through their teeth you know the pain i go through just even farting yet alone going for a movement i take a laxative called movicol this stuff is like setting your inside to shall we say soft scoop i got angry that a tinned can of soup id brought to make an otherwise shitty monday go by a bit better was gone on the monday i returned to the office so i hatched my plan making a nice batch of home made curry i made sure to add to the last of it a nice water mix of movicol and let it simmer down into the curry sauce quick taste test you barely noticed the slight lemon flavour to it i left said meal in the fridge on tuesday and awaited my return to the office on wednesday it appears overnight that someone developed a very nasty case of rocket like bum issues and had to go home after it has settled down now i knew whod done it and with one simple email i warned them that i would gladly accept an apology or some money towards the stolen food if they didnt want this to go any further nice how i found in there after
one of the stories my father in law told me which is perfect for rpettyrevenge so here it goes my father in law used to work for a construction company and he and his colleages had a workvantruck at their disposal but the tires were in bad shape pretty much bald now my father in law had complained about this before and urged to get them changed up for safety reasons but his boss kept saying he would get the tires replaced but remained empty promises so after a few months my father in law spots a the police doing a routine traffic stop of random vehicles my father in laws worktruck was not pulled over but he pulled over anyways and asked the cops to write his truck up the cops gave the boss a ticket and a warning to replace the tires within days or he would have to go to traffic court my father in law got in no trouble since he couldnt help getting pulled over and got his new tires

on my small early morning regional flight today a large huffy woman took her seat next to me in the front row of the plane and immediately pulled out her tablet and pen to start playing a very important game of solitaire now im not sure what happened when the huffy lady boarded but it was clear she already irked the flight attendant the flight attendant was one of those wellversed types who had the entire safety spiel memorised and you could tell she took her job seriously i always watch the attendants do their thing because i like them to know at least someone is paying attention well our huffy friend was having none of it and had her nose buried in her tablet come to the part of the safety talk where the oxygen masks are explained usually the attendant winds the tube around their hand and only lets the mask drop an inch or two not today i watched the flight attendant hold the mask above the panel and paused for a brief moment before letting the entire tube extend and the mask fell onto the tablet screen right in front of the face of the huffy lady who gave a surprised jump and finally looked up the flight attendant looked at me and gave me a very subtle smile and just carried on with the rest of her demonstration its little reasons like this that i always pay attention to the flight crews you never know what little humourous acts of pettiness they have up their sleeves stored away for the inattentive and rude passengers thats all carry on with your day

this revenge happened a few years ago but i was reminded of it today and thought id share it with you wonderful people i was in my very early s and working at a retail store and used to take my breaks away from the store for multiple reasons on this day i decided to eat at the lake which is public property throughout the park i bought a wrap from nearby my store and drove to the lake i sat down at the picnic tables that were nearby a frenchfry truck while i was eating my wrap some asshole seagull got very bold and divebombed my wrap while it was sitting in front of me on the table as this made a mess i went and asked the chiptruck guy if i could have a couple napkins and he exclaimed that they were for chiptruck customers only i explained that i am a customer just not today and that his attitude will only make me not ever want to eat there in the future he gave me a stupid look and didnt say anything so i went back to the table and cleaned up the mess the best i could as i was walking back to my car i went to place the garbage in the bin near his chiptruck he literally came out of the truck and yelled at me saying the garbage can is for customers only and the picnic tablespublic property were also for his customers only now there must have been seagulls lurking around me in hopes of getting their beak wet with my tasty wrap so i went back to the picnic tables which he claimed were his and threw the remnants of my wrap up in the air so that shit went everywhere the seagulls went crazy and him and his little cunt of a girlfriend came running out of the truck following me as i walked to my car and took pictures of my license plate at this point i thought my petty revenge was over and i was pleased with the result as im sure i had inconvenienced them more than they had me but two days later a cop shows up at my door saying that they received a complaint that i was vandalizing public property i explained to the cop what had happened and he told me that i shouldnt have done what i did but that the chiptruck is not allowed to claim public property as their own and the next time i went to the lake there was no more chiptruck 
happened earlier this evening so im in my ford hybrid escape parked in at costco im killing time eating an early fast food dinner and listening to the tail end of a news segment the mother of the minivan next to me starts loading up the days haul when the year old leans up against the back driver sliding door pause a second my sport suv windows are the darkest factory tint legally allowed so at dusk its difficult to see into the back my car also note hybrids are silent when on they can remain ninja silent up until enough time has passed that the gas engine kicks on to charge the batteries a bit generally minutes of silence back to the story so this kid apparently is still locked out of his car supposed to be helping mother load maybe and is eyeballing my rather dirty windows as im not paying attention i hear the unmistakable sounds of dry fingers writing on my windows i look over to my right rear passenger window and see the kid writing w a s h m e in big letters im grinning because he clearly doesnt know im in the very car hes defacing i think for a moment and allow the kid to continue his seconds of humor at my expense my poor car really does need a wash high winds today dust storms recent muddy rains etc plus the wife would to give me a i tooooold you so lecture which she enjoys i think the kid finishes up but wait he continues his finger shenanigans the unmistakable mushroom head appears and the shaft starts to form wtf this little is drawing a penis as if my car sensed the indignity of this trolls act the engine kicks over from hybrid mode and instantly starts up the kid yelps back in shock garnering his mothers attention i use this moment to role down my back rear window as he looks directly into my eyes can i help you yeah in the heat of the moment i couldnt think up a witty comeback for shame his mother comes over and notices her sons vehicle graffiti and grabs him roughly by the upper arm she apologizes profusely to me all the while making him take some nowwet paper towels she just bought to wipe away his urban art from my car the look on his face when my hybrid motor started up on its own was priceless tldr sitting in my parked car killing time and punk kick starts writting wash me on my windows as he starts to draw a penis my hybrid engine kicks on startling him as his mother makes him wash it off
when i was in college i used to carry around a netbook because i type faster than i write one day a girl sat next to me and started to copy the notes off my screen she didnt even try to listen and take her own notes so i made the font size and dimmed the screen light take that edit she also gave me the finger after i did that edit edit also she kept her phone on the table and it kept on vibrating i dont mind people texting but she didnt even have the decency to put her phone on silent edit edit edit i guess people dont read edit posts but i will still post this in conclusion her phone keeps on vibrating which distracted me her copying off my screen changing the font size amp dimming the screen lights petty revenge
note this is not my story but my fathers my dad runs a small cab company in our city and it does fairly well for itself as with any job with active customers though dealing with people can sometimes be like dropping a cinder block on your toes over and over annoying painful and it makes you wonder why you keep picking up the cinder block one day my dad who is dispatching his drivers gets a call from a guy well call him andy dick mr dick calls up my father and requests a cab gives his name address and time of pickup everything goes smoothly my father probably relaxed a little as it all went well on the phone instead of the unusual antics with some customers not knowing where they are or cant pay or something so my dad calls up his driver who has a real name but we all affectionately called him duh because he was about as intelligent as a bioluminescent mushroom and sends him to go get andy duh goes to pick up andy dick only to see him hop into a discount cab the fucker called two cab companies at once this is a really scumbaggy move as it wastes the drivers time and gas cab drivers dont make a whole lot of money and a lot of what they do make goes into gas and food andy dick was being really inconsiderate its unfortunate but this happens a lot with various customers so duh calls my father back and tells him the situation my father calmly says alright ill take care of this and writes down andys name number and address on a sticky note then plays the waiting game sure enough andy calls two days later and requests a cab from the same address the conversation went as follows ad hey i need a cab at address f no ad what do you mean no what the hell is wrong with you f the last time you called me you called discount cab at the same time and got into their car you wasted my time my gas and my money you will not call us again ad hey fuck you man that was my brother not me f well it seems that you and your brother need to have a long talk about being considerate to other people click my father hung up then came the revenge my dad waited about five minutes called both discount and yellow cab and cancelled his calls tldr guy called my dads cab company got into a different cab next time my dad cancelled both his appointments edit id like to state that i totally understand why someone would call two taxis at once its understandable but still really annoying and inconvenient hence why its on rpettyrevenge also this is not my story i have no personal or emotional connection to it and im not a cab driver i dont have some sort of nonuber bias i think uber is a great service and i dont mind that people use it
ok little bit of backstory to set the scene i grew up with my dad and stepmom largely without electricity sure we had a solar panel wind generator and a backup gasolinepowered generator but all these were for were to keep the water pump and refrigerator running we had to haul our own water in a gallon tank from a well miles away used oil lamps for light and wood stoves for heat baths consisted of large pots of water heated on the stove and dumped into the bathtub nearly boiling hot ampnbsp my brother and i had a few lapses of sound judgment regarding time passed since the water had been dumped and subsequently went streaking through the house in an attempt to cool our affected areas ampnbsp now fast forward about years i was currently staying with my mom for the summer as my dad allowed every so often and i was playing on the greatest gift i had ever been given a ps now once i had discovered electronics i was into electronics if it plugged in made noises was used in an object that made noises or played games i wanted it with a passion so this playstation was my most treasured possession in the world made even more so by the fact that my mom had saved for a year to get it for me ampnbsp now the second greatest gift i had ever been given was given along with the ps final fantasy i loved this game far beyond even any game out nowadays if i were given a choice between both a ps and an xbox one or a copy of final fantasy ff would win hands down i played this game daily and i loved the story the characters the gameplay all of it ampnbsp cue entry for my sister ill just call her sis for now she wasnt at fault in this issue and her boyfriend stoner mcfuckface stoner for short sis and stoner both enjoyed weed but stoner far beyond her recreational use im pretty sure he woke up every day ripped a hit on the bong and repeated at least once every minutes throughout his day they had just gotten back from driving around to who knows where and were headed back to her room for another joint on their way past my room stoner noticed that i was playing ff ampnbsp oh hey awesome i heard that game was really good could i borrow it from you ampnbsp that was met about as well as you might think it would be with me looking him dead in the eye and saying not for all the money you have in your wallet ampnbsp ok i understand no problem have fun dude ampnbsp they finished their trek into siss room shut the door and proceeded with whatever they had planned probably involving more weed i went back to my game totally absorbed in getting cloud through wave after wave of enemies was trying to powerlevel to prepare to take on the weapons ruby emerald and ultima ampnbsp a little while later i felt the call of nature and ran cloud back to a safe area to save and make a quick bathroom run while in the bathroom i heard my sisters door open and a few seconds later the front door as well accompanied by stoner calling ok babe see you later im heading home so glad that the walking thc depository was gone i finished my business and headed back to my room for another round of level grinding ampnbsp only to find my tv frozen on the scene i left cloud in my ps open the game disc taken out and my whole case for the game discs included gone i was pissed i ran to my sisters room and proceeded to read her the riot act as well as a year old could give an year old at least she called stoner up relayed my outraged message and was given the reply dude chill out ill take good care of it and youll have it back next time i come over ampnbsp cue my year old electronically deprived meltdown ampnbsp so a week passes and stoner finally shows back up im pretty much champing at the bit at this point damn near hopping up and down in my eagerness to get back to my ff fix stoner walks in the front door and immediately hands me my game in less than seconds im back in my room turning my ps on and beginning to open my game however i notice something a bit amiss with the case something i hadnt noticed during my eager sprint theres a crack in the front of the case ampnbsp i stifled an angry shout not wanting to press the issue just yet since a case is just a case and this guy outweighed me by over half of my weight besides the case didnt affect gameplay right unfortunately the discs do and as i opened the case i saw the extent of the damage ampnbsp disc has a crack all the way from the outer edge to about half an inch from the center hole disc has what looks like ash burns all over the black side of the disc and disc disc has a scratch in it so deep i could balance a quarter in it im pissed ampnbsp i stood up walked to my sisters room opened her door without knocking and walked in on them rolling a joint i wordlessly showed my sister the case and discs her eyes got wide she knew how much i loved this game she looked at him and he looked back to me sorry dude ampnbsp since i knew if i remained in that room for much longer i would either become a murderer or more likely get my ass knocked out for attacking someone that much bigger than me i stormed back to my room the wheels in my head already turning within a few minutes i came up with a simple plan after verifying that stoner and sis were still smoking i headed outside with a small screwdriver straight to his truck and spent the next few minutes using the screwdriver to open the valves on all of his tires fully flattening all of them including his spare then feeling vindicated i headed back to my room and popped frogger into my ps still trying to block out my rage at my favorite game being destroyed ampnbsp a little while later stoner walked out of my sisters room noticeably more red in the eye and headed out to go home after a few seconds i heard a muffled what the fuck followed by the front door opening and footsteps headed back into my sisters room stoner and my sister had a tense conversation and they both walked out of her room while sis walked out the front door to look at his truck stoner stepped into my room ampnbsp hey did you see anyone screwing with my truck ampnbsp i looked back at him sorry dude tldr sisters stoner boyfriend stole and destroyed my favorite game ever i flattened all of his tires and his spare

so i started working in a photo lab for a popular store a few years ago and i was trained by a girl who had worked there for about six years i really think she was bipolar or something some days she would be super sweet to me and other days she would rip my head off for the most minor stuff omg strangelovenebula you put a fucking marker in the pen drawer heads are gonna roll she always made me really nervous that i was fucking up my job constantly complained about everything i did and was just a really crazy bitch to everyone that worked there one time she freaked out and told me that dozens of customers had lodged complaints about me she never specified about what when i asked my store manager he had no idea what she was talking about she was just nuts and i think she enjoyed trying to make me feel bad which is tough since im pretty easygoing anyways at the end of the night i would have to remove this film rack out of the film processor and put it in a bowl of water to keep the rollers from drying out in the morning when she would open she would take it down from the shelf by the sink and put it back in the film processor for the day in my own form of petty revenge i began to fill the bowl each night exactly to the brim then i would set it on the very edge of the top shelf which was juuuust out of her reach in the mornings she would have to stand on tiptoe to get it down and inevitably the water would slosh down on her as she fumbled with the bowl she bitched at me in passing a few times but i kept it up she started hanging up signs that said not to fill the bowl all the way or not to put it on the top shelf but i ignored these and would cackle to myself a little each night as i did this she got more and more pissed off trying to complain to my store manager he pretty much ignored everything she said because it was wellknown that she was a crazy drama queen that tried to get everyone in trouble for something or other anyways i guess i cracked her because one day she was trying to complain to him about it and he wasnt really listening and refused to write me up for something so silly she ended up throwing a notebook at him as hard as she could and he fired her on the spot he promoted me to her job head photo and i got a fiftycent an hour raise its such a petty revenge but i really got a kick out of hearing other coworkers tell me how she would storm out of the lab in a huff with water dripping down her face and a damp shirt every morning a few times it really just toppled down and soaked her completely it warms the cockles of my heart
i live in a villa complex where each tenant has a pool of one sort or another on their third floor which is open to the elements some have lappools some have jacuzzi pools and some just have bigholesfullofwatertodrunkenlypartyaroundatallhoursofthefuckingnight my immediate neighbor to the east has the latter model hes also single and loves to rev up noisy raucous pool parties which do indeed last until the wee wee hours now i may be a bit of an old phart but i like my parties as well however i also like to sleep and tend to get a small bit a tiny bit well homicidally irritated when this happens on a weekly basis imploring him to shut the fuck up you chapped bastard and will you turn that offensive crap down always either goes unheeded or is greeted with a single digit salute and numerous anatomically impossible suggestions well then now then he works in the field as well as the office and is sometimes away for days at a time hee hee hee back in the day i studied hydrology and fluvial systems ie rivers in order to map currents and flow rates we would use p fluorescein tablets slightly smaller in size than a hockey puck to give a beautiful fluorescent green color to the water at concentrations around ppm well fine and dandy for flowing rivers and other open areas of water but in enclosed bodies of water fluorescein dye is exactly that an organic dye when noisy neighbor had to go out on a job one warm summers eve i slipped over the common wall that separates our two villas and got into his pool shack where the filters pumps and other assorted pooly gizmos were housed everything was shut down in his absence so it was quite simple to open the sump of his filter and drop in of the p tablets quietly seal everything up and retreat to my own domicile but not before i unscrew every light bulb which would illuminate the pool a couple of days later noisy mc asswipe arrives home and how about that its dark out and he wants to unwind from a hard couple of days of fucking around out in the desert with a nice relaxing swim he flips on the filters and pumps switches are located inside the villa and evidently goes to change into his swimwear in the meantime the dye has had a chance to liquefy and the way i figure it at a pool capacity of liters of water quickly ramped up to about ppm at that concentration it is an organic dye and utterly harmless well for the most part the dye acts exactly like a packet of rit in the wash machine everything carbonbased that goes in the water will be stained a nice indelible fluorescent green very chic not bothering with the lack of lights he dives into the pool and does a few laps before floating around and deciding it was time for a cold one the screams and plaintive wails reverberating around the compound were most satisfying hey asshole keep it down over there tl dr never fuck with a cranky geologist who has studied aqueous geochemistry 
this story comes courtesy of my wife who is the only female working at a welding shop in out city naturally she gets a lot of flak for it but this one time a guy crossed the line there is one of the other apprentices there appropriately nicknamed steveo who is majorly sexist and is always bumping heads with my wife now shes a smart cookie and youre looking for an asswhoppin if you try to engage her in a battle of wits he always came up with some comment he thought was smart but she always threw it back in his face one day she got to work and in big capital letters written in white paint marker was the word slut on her brand new welding helmet she quickly hid it and took it to the back room to scrub the paint off luckily it was fresh enough to come off without seriously damaging the helmet when steveo whom she already suspected walked out of the break room a few moments later his guilt was confirmed by his greeting hows it goin slut now im sure most of you would freak out cuss call him names and probably even hit him but remember how smart my wife is she hatched an even better idea she went to the shop supervisor and told him about the situation he offered to write up a harassment report reprimand steveo and the usual she asked if it was okay if she handled it on her own a few grins crept their way onto the normally stoic supers face as she detailed her plan with his blessings she waited until lunch the bell rang for the shop to go to lunch but one person would be missing from the break room that day my wife spent her lunch hour spray painting steveos work bench and stool with spray paint this wasnt ordinary paint either this was the paint they use on roads bright fluorescent pink and orange that could be spotted from yards with your back turned while wearing sunglasses by the time she was done it looked like hasbro and mattel had a lovemaking session on this desk and forgot to clean up after themselves the backdrop was a beautiful shade of pink accented by orange flowers and the word princess the lunch bell rang again signaling time to return to work a crowd gathered around steveos desk and laughter rang through the shop needless to say steveos nickname isnt steveo anymore he missed the next days of work for some unknown reason and hes a few short days away from his last at this particular welding shop tldr i dont think hes going to get a good reference from this place edit bonus justice i forgot to mention that steveo spent his whole lunch when he got back grinding it off his table now the name princess has stuck permanently if hed just laughed it off and came to work in a tiara then it wouldve been funny for a week

so this is my sisters story she is currently attending college in the midwest also for the record i have no beef with conservatives or liberals just people that talk out of their ass so as said my sister is attending college in the midwest she has a very good friend that she shares a few classes with named chuck now chuck spent a few years in the us army before coming to college and he unfortunately lost his left leg below the knee in afghanistan chuck is very humble about his service he never brags about it really hardly ever mentions it and he never ever talks about his injury and he walks naturally enough on his prosthetic that you wouldnt even guess he had a fake leg in one of the classes that my sister and chuck share theres this little group of freshmen who seem to consider themselves the last vanguard of conservatism in college they all come from affluent families never miss an opportunity to tell you about how reagan was the best president in history and have never spent a moment of their lives serving others and scoff at the idea that they should anyway one day my sisters class happened to be discussing guantanamo bay water boarding all the hot button issues on terrorist suspects chuck happened to give his opinion that he believed the prisoners held at gitmo at least deserve a fair trial and mentioned that he was opposed to the government water boarding individuals the leader of the little pack of conservatives when he heard chuck say that sneered at him dude how do you even consider yourself american chuck has a lot of restraint and i suppose he doesnt feel a need to justify himself to some dumb kid in college so he just rolled his eyes and let it go my sisters more vengeful half though really wanted to have something to shove in this kids face so she looked at chuck for a minute then loudly asked him hey chuck howd you lose your leg again chuck just have her a halfsmile and said lost that thing in afghanistan my sister gave mr conservative a good little grin and mr conservative just stood there kinda stammering and my sister triumphantly thought to herself yeah dude you just told a wounded combat veteran unamerican edit hey guys i didnt explain this adequately in my post and i want to clear it up i dont intend to paint all conservatives in a negative light like the guys in my sisters story i know asshole conservatives are a slim minority compared to conservatives as a whole just like asshole liberals are a slim minority to liberals as a whole so i do apologize if i came across as smearing all conservatives it was not my intent
it was a very hot summer day and i had missed lunch due to work so between calls i stopped at a the local branch of a well known taco restaurant chain does that ring any bells there was a rather large sweaty woman behind the counter the only employee in the place she came up to the register took my order gave me change she then went back to the food prep area to make my tacos bad enough that she didnt wash her hands after handling money but she proceeded to mop the sweat off her forehead and face with her bare hand wipe it on her uniform shirt and then made my tacos i was stunned so stunned in fact that i was speechless i took my bag of food walked to the trashcan in the parking lot and tossed it then i parked across the street picked up the phone and called the county health department i described what had just happened and the woman on the other end was aghast she said that they would open up a case and follow up immediately ten minutes later here comes the county health inspector i learned later that the restaurant was cited for numerous health code violations and received a fine and plenty of bad publicity i went to another place ordered a foot long subway sandwich went back to that parking lot across from the taco place and ate it while watching the health department do their thing it is true revenge is a dish best eaten cold and alone
one of the responsibilities we have in our kitchen i work at is to mop it thoroughly at the end of service we always try to do it speedily as to not be in the way of anyone put up wet floor signs etc a lot of the foh staff come through our kitchen to get to the cellar its a running joke in our kitchen that the quickest way to get a waitress in our kitchen is to mop the floor but its all in good fun and mopping up dirty footprints only takes a few seconds now ive come into a habit of always telling people entering the kitchen whenever im on mopping duty that the floor is wet because i know sometimes people are too preoccupied to notice wet floor signs everyone knows i do it to be helpful everyone that is except a handful of waitresses if youve ever worked in service you know the type i mean arrogant always believe themselves the most important member of staff for some reason they got it into their heads that i tell them the floor is wet as a way of telling them to stay out of the kitchen and not make the floor dirty and ive heard them bitching about me before i tried explaining to them but they wouldnt listen the petty revenge the last time i mopped and one of them came through the kitchen i said nothing and watched her slip up on the wet floor right in front of the wet floor sign

a few months ago i was studying in the library and the guy across the table from me was having a loud and obnoxious conversation about a friend who had pissed him off earlier it was probably just heightened by the silence of the room but still extremely distracting he kept talking and talking and talking so i asked him to go somewhere else to finish his phone call he scuffed his breath at me and kept talking when he went to the toilet half an hour later i stole one of the little rubber bits off the bottom of his laptop so it wobbles and moved to a different floor fear me

a few years back i was travelling throughout mexico to visit family on the final leg of the trip i took a long bumpy flight to mexico city where i would transfer to another plane and begin my journey home to canada exhausted feeling grimy and stressed i lined up to checkin with my airline at the crack of dawn it was a good thing that my flight was hours away because the line was over one hundred people long winding throughout the terminal and past the shops selling mexican crafts and shitty tequila in colourful handcrafted bottles after what felt like a day but was probably just minutes i had made it close enough to actually see the checkin counter and a glimmer of hope on the horizon and my stress began to fade away that is until i saw a man of about or old enough to know better anyway walk to the front of the empty queue beside us to see if he was in the right spot after pretending to look around and ascertain where he should be he decided that he deserved to be closer to the front and just cut into the line about people ahead of me my blood began to boil but i was too far away to say or do anything so i just patiently silently waited like i had been doing for the past minutes looking around i noticed that some others had noticed what hed done but were also opting to remain silent as i approached the final row of the queue i noticed that the man had a maple leaf patch sewn to his bag and this made me angrier for some reason now im not one to be patriotic because its stupid to be proud of just being born somewhere but i know that for better or worse people are judged wherever they go its why people put the maple leaf on their bags anyways because of the good reputation canadians have and here was this asshole flying the flag while being a selfish twat finally it is the chosen ones turn to checkin and luckily the desk was about feet away from where i was in the queue i watched and waited for him to place his luggage on the scale because i knew hed have to turn towards me for this and finally he did i raise my voice enough to be heard by him and anyone in a foot radius and say to him excuse me sir he looks at me if youre going to continue cutting in lines can you please take the flag off of your bag youre an embarrassment to the country he looks flustered and embarrassed but remains silent he turns back to the desk and eventually shuffles off i was proud for calling him on what he did even if it was after he had already reaped the rewards of being a selfish linecutter later on when i was sitting at my gate i noticed that he was approaching and he noticed that i noticed so he decided to sit far enough away to hide his shame from my eyesight he was going to vancouver and i to toronto so we never had the opportunity to see each other again 
so my neighbors seem to be incapable of properly operating their vehicles especially their van they regularly set off the alarm on this thing disturbing everyone in the neighborhood its annoying as hell to be interrupted by the shriek of a car alarm several times a week they also park two of their vehicles such that they take up three parking spaces which is frustrating in an area with limited parking last night as i was heading out to the store before bed i noticed that the door of their van was wide open it was lightly snowing but scheduled to change to rainsleetice during the course of the night normally im the kind of person who will go knock on doors to let my neighbors know if their car lights were left on or their door is ajarbut not this time when i left for work this morning it was pouring down rain and everything was covered in a sheet of iceand their door was still wide open hope you enjoy your soggy icy interior ya jerks

this is my first reddit post so please be kind so i dont have a car and am therefore cursed to the world of public transportation last weekend for th of july i took the train down the shore to visit some family naturally at the end of the weekend the train back to the city was extremely crowdedi made my way to find an open seat the conductors made the usual noises about keeping seats open and not blocking the aisle etc i spot a woman sitting in an aisle seat with her handbag next to her pointedly looking out the window i put on my best smile and very politely ask her if i could sit in the open window seat she acts as though she hasnt heard so i ask again a little louder this time and still smiling brightly she finally turns around gives me a once over and flatly says no then proceeds to pointedly stare out the window again lucky for me there was another kind woman sitting directly behind her who moved her massive suitcase to her lap and allowed me to squeeze in next to her it was at this time my petty revenge idea took form there is a gap in the seats where the back cushion meets the butt cushion and its nice place to rest your foot except the person in front can feel said foot in their nether regions so i normally dont put my feet there not that day i shoved my foot right in that gap and for the next hour every time the train shifted bounced or maybe any slight movement i moved my foot deeper into that gap relishing her discomfort and she wouldnt move over on the seat bc that would leave the aisle seat open for someone to sit next to her so rather than being considerate she suffered over an hour with my foot assaulting her bum tldr woman wouldnt share seat so she got a foot up her butt
i was taking a hour flight that took off around pm i had the window seat next to dudes i like to take the window seat because i have good bladder control so i wont have to cause inconvenience for other people and also dont like to be bothered to have to get up for other people when they have to go to the restroom i usually can go without any restroom breaks for most flights unless international anyways on this particular flight there is a bit of chatter amongst the passengers but its night time so it slowly dies out and the lights are dimmed in the cabin all is quiet except for the dudes next to me who are chattering away loudly i planned to take a nice nap as a lot of people would on a late flight but it seemed pretty futile as they were talking nonstop now i know its my fault for not bringing earplugs but i also think they should have some common courtesy to see that the rest of the cabin is quiet so they should at least try and be quieter after mins i am a little peeved at not being able to sleep so i lean over and ask them if they can lower their voices a bit as i was trying to sleep they do so for about mins and then gradually raises their voices back to the original volume i guess i couldve also tried asking a flight attendant but it didnt really cross my mind at that point after a long time they finally quieted down but theres only like less than an hour in the flight left and im already too annoyed to try and sleep both of them bring out their laptops and seem to be working intently on some pretty important stuff they even have their headphones in thats when i realize i have the power to inconvenience their flight as revenge for my inability to nap excuse me i have to use the restroom they kinda look annoyed as they have to grab their things put up their little tables and then both get up to make room for me i get out of the restroom and they have to once again get up and get out of their seats i wait for a good minutes and repeat the process once more their sighs and looks of annoyance were worth it and i didnt even need to pee tldr seat mates were being loud and preventing me from napping so i made them get up so i could use the restroom on our late flight

i park my motorcycle on the street every day where parking is hard to find because of this i always slide it in front of the tow zone sign behind the last car this way im not taking up any spaces and everybody wins that is until some douche had a problem with my bike being behind his truck although he had lots of room to leave his parking spot he decided it would be easier to move my bike into the tow zone a kind neighbor told me what had happened so after thanking him and moving my bike out of the tow zone i started to plot my revenge a couple days later i saw the truck parked under a tree branch and i could finally fulfill my plan of revenge i hung a bird feeder on the tree branch and the next day his truck was covered in bird shit it was a good feeling 
hello pettyrevenge just a lurker you are my favourite subreddit and i have a few stories i want to share this first happened several years ago in a dollar store parking lot when i was still in college finished my shopping i come up to my little car all ready to head home i hop inside and start er up doing my checks before leaving important to note there is a car parked in front of me a car to the right and a larger minivan to the left im boxed in and can only back my vehicle out as i was about to leave the younger couple in the van parked to the left had just pulled up with their cart and were beginning to unload not wanting to be rude and spook them or accidentally bump someone i patiently waited for them to finish putting everything away no problems even gave them a smile when they happened to look my way the couple finishes and the wife gets in the passenger side of the van husband grabs the cart good man hes going to put it away in the cart bin right over there wait what no i watched in horror as the man left his shopping cart directly behind my car then walked away you have got to be kidding me the fucking cart box is a few steps away you had no issues walking it this far already fucking lazy piece of shit can you tell i was mad reddit i was fuming i just wanted to go home to study and now i had to deal with this assholes shopping cart blocking me in so i did what any good girl does i waited i watched him saunter back to his minivan he didnt see me quietly ninja out of my car and grab the cart nor did he see me when he got inside the van and i rolled that mother fucking cart directly behind his stupid vehicle alongside the bumper handle bars unable to even be seen under the little back window then i ran to my car backed out and laughed as i drove away with the windows down leaving the parking lot to the sound of a minivan running over a shopping cart and the pissed screams of his wife really made my day reddit judging by the satisfying crashing sound he must of just floored it backing out my only regret was not looping back to see the full results of my pettiness i bet it was expensive to fix though tldr watched a lazy asshole man parked beside me box me in my parking space by leaving his shopping cart behind my car i pushed the cart right back and he runs it over take that fucker edit holy shit my first post and this got lots of upvotes nice to see everyone hates folks who leave their carts all willy nilly over the lot as much as i do edit edit i can kinda see why maybe he could have thought i was going inside to shop and wanted to give me his cart but my lights were on music playing and engine running the entire time they unloaded i could have turned off the car and gotten out any time if i was going inside to shop still rude imo to place the cart directly behind somes car and in the already cramped driving lanes in the parking lots

so my first ever flatmate had basically been the flatmate from hell she didnt do dishes left raw chicken on top of my open pack of sandwich meat on more than one occasion would leave me to clean the whole place top to toe multiple times a month i would tidy as i went but she would just let the mess accumulate she even abandoned me to handle an inspection that shed requested be on a date suitable for her all myself which included gutting the flat so itd be presentable as we were students and the landlord already had very little faith she decided to let me know a month before the lease was up that she was planning to move out and id have to find a new roommate during my exam period i straight up hated her and im sure she was aware my flatmate also liked to take sometimes baths a day because she was apparently so stressed out by her uni course she would fill the bath to the brim with boiling water and add a splash of cold at the end i find baths disgusting and relied on the electric shower but these baths of hers always took hours meaning id be showering at am sometimes one month a gas bill came through in my name on top of a electricity bill id already had to deal with debt collector letters after a bill had been sitting opened by her which she kept to herself for months unpaid so this bill put me into a genuine panic i relied entirely on my student loan while her dad paid half her bills for her i managed to get her to pay her half and had a talk where i requested she cut down on the baths because i wouldnt be able to handle a bill like that again she heed and hawed but agreed this only lasted a week before she was back to basically living in the tub and i had been pushed and pushed and pushed past my limit more times than is even possibly acceptable so i hid the bath plug
im an english teacher in spain i wont lie to you we all have favorites and we all have students that we cannot stand i teach kids and adults alike but there is this one little nine year old shit that i find particularly infuriating lets call him pablo before you get on to me for enacting petty revenge on a child lets remember where we are pablo enrages me hes an only child and his mother has been telling his the sun shines out of his ass his entire life so he thinks he is a little genius even though he consistently answers questions incorrectly instead of taking a hint and i dont know learning something he shrugs it off the reason that he makes so many mistakes of course is because he simply doesnt listen to me or do the homework i assign his mother is also a factor in this as she does nothing to enforce it and routinely justifies his missing work and failed quizzes etc every day its a different excuse also i just dont like the petulant look on his stupid face side note here spain is kind of weird about pencils im from the states and there weve got pencils with erasers attached not so here almost all of the kids have got pencils with separate erasers in their pencil cases and they look at my mechanical pencils like they are robot magic or something since pablo is muy especial his mom got him some fancy mechanical pencils one daysuper fancythe kind with an adjustable eraser and a little plastic cap to protect it classy but oh no he left it behind one day actually i didnt even realize it was his i pick up all the child shrapnel left behind for the next time one of them forgets something but i put it in my drawer and forgot about it i guess you know where this is heading the next day when pablo wanted to know if i had found any mechanical pencils around the class i spontaneously developed amnesia oops you guys are hilarious and i loved your extra petty suggestions for additional revenge i cant believe for one moment i doubted that i would be looked down upon for targeting poor innocent pablito

so i recently discovered this subreddit and i used to work in a call centre for years we serviced every major bank in canada and credit unions im thinking about doing up a few of these but ill start off with one of my favourites its a bit of a long read but it pays off a few years ago we did a two week pilot project for td canada trust called the ipod campaign you switch monthly payments a mortgage payment insurance gym membership etc over to be debited from a newly opened td account and the bank will give you a free ipod shuffle for the campaign i was part of a team of a dozen agents that dealt with these switches and the only one on staff to handle complaints we couldnt process any of these switches without an authorization form that the client signed when they opened their account this stated they gave us permission to switch debits over on their behalf last day of the campaign i get a few auth forms on my desk theyre blank no customer signatures no customer contact numbers just the account numbers and the tellerclients names i call the branch rep twice our policy over two days with my last call stating unfortunately if we dont receive the forms with the customer signatures by pm local time we will be unable to process the request and the documents will be destroyed for security purposes fast forward a week the branch rep calls me back hi my name is jon with td canada trust easyswitch how may i assist you today hello is this the scam artist that can explain when my none of my clients are getting their ipods bad opening but ive had worse i begin to explain that this particular form she was calling about was blank the campaign was done no ipod for the client did you hear that she says we certainly did and frankly thats a crock of shit responded the clients she had two of them in a conference call wrong move bitch wrong move gtme mr and ms my apologies for any inconvenience as id explained to your branch rep in a voicemail last last week she had sent us a blank authorization form without your signatures we didnt have the legal authority to contact any of your billers to process the switch had she provided us with your contact information we couldve informed you to go into the branch to sign the form instead id left her two calls over a hour period advising her of this we couldve even processed it the day after the campaign ended by any chance did she happen to notify you of any of this gthusband she told us we could open the account over the phone and sign whenever we got the chance gtme i apologize you were misinformed without the signatures we didnt have the legal authority to make these changes on your behalf this is a feature in our service to prevent privacy our term for identity theft as the switches havent been made you dont have any outgoing payments i see that your old account with cibc is still open so between me and you this promotion is set for national distribution in the summer gthusband so we can close down the account reopen it in the summer and apply for the ipod then gtme im not allowed to advise you to close an account down but technically you could you may get a question or two from the branch manager about why youre closing down the account a week after opening it gtwife dont worry well tell them the branch rep interjected with uhmms and uhhhs but its pretty hard to shoot yourself in the foot when your foots already in your mouth she lied to countless people thinking she could get a bunch of new clients and have somebody else ie me deal with the mess the next ingoing call i get is from the branch manager offering to explain the situation to the clients on my behalf why because the branch rep is no longer employed that evening i went home my girlfriend asked me how my day went and i responded with i got a bitch fired 
so i put up a guitar on craigslist i saved up for it for an entire summer in high school but nowadays they go from so i listed it for thinking that maybe someone will pick it up and if not i can just lower the price little by little till it does no big deal i dont need the money i just havent played guitar since high school so i dont really need to keep it anyway the first guy who emails me about it seems normal but when we started texting to set up a time its pretty clear that hes an entitled knowitall prick thats fine but i guess my post should come with a warning that i wont negotiate much if youre an asshat his first text made it clear that he somehow deserved the guitar since i clearly dont know what i have on my hands it only went downhill after that but i decided at the end i might as well just have some fun with him since the sale clearly wasnt going through i would have sold it for easily if i had been negotiating with someone with even decent people skills anyway i figure he blocked me and that was the end of it but no he decides to poke the bear and send me an email letting me know he bought a guitar for the lowball price he offered me hes probably lying but two can play that game i even took the craigslist ad down just to prove my pettiness my dad says he wants to learn to play when he retires in a few months so i figure thisll be a good present for him tldr dont be an ass to me on craigslist or ill give my dad an awesome guitar as a present 
this one is kind of ongoing but i think it fits here bit of a backstory my housemate is a gamer not a casual gamer but the kind who can get so pissed off at his games he once threw one of his xbone controllers out his window so hard it cleared the street beside our house and landed in the empty lot kiddy corner to our house naturally his obsession with video games has him playing them until am and since he is unemployed he does this daily keeping me up with explosions yelling of various colourful adverbs and stomping on the floor of his room in rage ive put up with this for a few months since he said he was trying to find a job but after multiple complaints from our neighbours we are in a town house block and me needing to be alert for my job line of sight internet installer icy roofs are not fun its gotten to the point where i have decided to take action there were other factors hes a shitty housemate in general but those are the reasons im using this particular vector of attack well that and the fact that hes not going to figure it out the plot working with routers almost daily for various kinds of customers has shown me how to configure them in a wide number of aggravating ways from using a hard lined connection to flicker the wifi on and off dropping his connection to whatever server hes gaming on to turning off ssid broadcasting makes it so you have to manually enter the ssid and password on every single device you want to connect to it to the lovely and autonomous access time restriction page the last one there is my phase three for this one and was just put into place last night ive set it up so his xbox is denied its internet access after pm when i usually decide id better hit the hay ive set this to take effect on weekdays and ive set it to am on weekends so our neighbours will stop coming to me with complaints about him the result had my first good sleep in weeks to the sound of him running downstairs to reset the router tldr if you rely on a service that your housemate works on daily you dont be an ass to him
one of the directors in my office has been an asshole lately about petty ridiculous things i wouldnt care but hes been btchy and nitpicky with not only his staff but with people who dont work directly for him including me a few mondays ago i noticed that saturdays mail for his department was sitting in their mail basket with a rubber band around it which usually means no ones gone through it i knew his assistant was out that day so i brought it to him his reaction am little late to be giving me saturdays mail isnt it a few weeks ago he saw an amazon package on someones desksomeone who doesnt work for him isnt in his department and who he has no authority overand sought them out to tell them how unprofessional it is to have personal packages delivered to the office because its a waste of company time and resources another time he overheard two women talking about the great deals they got at some sale and told them he didnt think it was appropriate for them to be talking about shopping at work i think mr consummate professional forgot that both he and his wife who doesnt even work for the company get all of their magazines and catalogs delivered to them here at the office so ive developed a new professional protocol that i hope he appreciates whenever i can i get a hold of his mail before he sees it and filter out all the unprofessional pieces ie his wifes pottery barn and ll bean catalogs his new yorker and architectural digest magazines their banana republic and macys coupons advertisements for free goods and services free promotional material etc anything i dont deem appropriate for the office i throw away whatever i think others might find interesting i put in the ladies room and the rest i read at my leisure only at lunch of course or give to my husband i hope mr director feels more professional now that company time and resources arent being spent on his personal mail 
i have a coworker that we mutually hate each other she acts like her shit doesnt stink and is quite the bitch she constantly talks to me like im an idiot despite me being here longer than her and knowing my job pretty well ive been to my supervisor and manager she reports directly to my manager but is at the same level i am just in a different roll that my supervisor doesnt cover despite them talking to her and i multiple times she continues to be a bitch while i am professional which has been witnessed by my supervisor a while back i noticed her parking in the handicap spots after lunch shes not handicap shes just lazy she doesnt do it in the morning because security does rounds not so often in the evening at first when i saw it it pissed me off recently when i saw her do it i saw she had a handicap tag in her rearview but i heard her talking to another guy on the way out saying how she recently got it from someone she knows that has and she backs in to the spot so its not as easy to see it the best part is our comapny requires an additional tag that can only be obtained by verifiying the tag is for you and you have a reason to park there obviously she doesnt have one im friends with the girl at the front desk and mentioned it to her and she said to let her know if i saw it and she would have her ticketed by our security guards last couple weeks she left for lunch a couple times and i went to look but she never parked in the handicap spots today i notice her come into the cafe with takeout bags finish my lunch go out front see her car and a huge smile was on my face went in to the front desk smiled at my friend said its there now and within seconds she was on the phone hey remember that car i told you to watch for parking in the handicap spots its out there now to the right can you go ticket her im not sure if my work issues fines for tickets doubtful but after a couple tickets they will tow i hope she keeps doing it because i will shave minutes off my lunch each day to go check and get you ticketed until you get towed
background so i used to work at one of those large retail homeimprovement stores as a cashier and one day i messed up pretty bad on this one super busy saturday i had been assigned to be at the customer service desk and since i was fairly new i wasnt exactly sure what to do when an angry or suspicious customer came up to the desk usually when you suspect people of trying to return stolen merchandise you would call over your manager and they would tell the customer that we werent going to take those items back however on this fateful saturday i found myself in that situation and i panicked the act i had been doing well with no hiccups at the customer service desk and i was getting the hang of all the duties there had just been a rush of customers and my area around my register was quite messy i was trying to organize everything before another wave of people came in thats when this very large ghetto and overall unpleasant lady came around the corner with a cart filled with the largest and most expensive cans of wood stain that we sold my suspicions were already up since she came around the wrong way and not through the front entrance she makes eye contact with me and slowly lugs her heavy cart up to my register now this bitch then starts to tell me this bullshit story about how she had left over stain from a project and that she didnt have a receipt but she would gladly give me her drivers license and take a store credit at this point i tell her i need to call a manager to get an override for a return of that amount but when i try to call their phone they wouldnt answer i called one of the head cashiers next the head cashiers were basically glorified cashiers who told people to go to their lunches and breaks and told him i have to get an override for a return over he simply replied ok ill be right there and hung up now this ghetto bitch starts to get all flustered and tells me i need to hurry up i scan all of the stain in her cart and the total came out to be but in order for me to put in on a merchandise card i had to get that override from my head cashier he came around the corner looking rushed and held out his card for me to scan i tried to signal to him that this lady was suspiciousasfuck but surprisingly he didnt catch my subtle gestures i opened my eyes wide and raised my eyebrows i was too worried about insulting this bitch so i didnt say anything i got the override and gave her the merchandise card and she quickly left my revenge as soon as she got out of the doors i called the paint department and asked them to check how many cans of that stain they had on hand sure enough they had less than what our inventory now said i doublechecked and asked the associates back there if they had seen anyone take any of the stain off the shelf earlier that day they confirmed my suspicions that bitch had taken them off of the shelves and returned them i was pretty upset i was thinking i was going to get written up for the first time for making such stupid mistake feeling defeated i went back to cleaning up my area as i wait for a manager to come by so i can tell them of what just happened then by some random happenstance i looked down next to my register by the phone and see a lone merchandise card the cards are usually in a pile on top of my register so i pick this one up and look at the back to see if it had been used sure enough the security code had been peeled off which meant it had been activated my heart started racing i grabbed the card and went to check the system to see if that was the card i put the return on i swiped the card and up on the screen pops remaining balance somehow i had grabbed an empty merchandise card on accident and gave that to the ghetto bitch i gleefully go to the purchase screen and ring up the same items and used the card and rebought the stain so our store sustained no loss my day went on and i had no other problems until the same ghetto bitch comes storming up to my register again this time she looked livid as hell and started yelling at me with vengeance apparently she had tried to buy some top line power drills with her card but somehow there was nothing on it i was thrilled i had the chance to get a redo with this bitch and so i made sure i wasnt going to screw this one up i look at her dead in the eyes and make up the best bullshit story i could think of at the time maam after you had left we checked the security cameras and it seemed that you had taken those items off of the shelf and never paid for them in the first place we were able to call the credit center and take back the money that you stole we have all of your drivers license info and you wont be able to do any more returns with any of our stores without the loss prevention being notified at this point she screamed at me you did what then she turned around and stormed out of the store huffing loudly to herself further justice i told my manager about it and he couldnt help but laugh and commended me on not fucking up any further he called our sister stores around the area and told them about a potential shoplifter that may come in they always do that when theres someone trying to steal a lot of merchandise and the next day when i arrived at work i was informed that the same lady tried to push out a cart with several hundred dollars worth of stuff from one of our sister stores and was promptly arrested because they knew she was going to try something like that i hate shoplifters and im glad she got what she deserved 
back in my college days about years ago i used to work at a local movie theater on this particular day i was working door ripping tickets and making sure no one came in who wasnt supposed to be there the thing that sucked about the lay out of the theater i worked at was that the secured area that i was watching with the actual theaters had no bathrooms or concession stands people would need to exit to the lobby to use those things it made it a lot easier on me if people held on to their ticket stubs people would often go to the bathroom as a movie was getting out and walk out with the crowd and not say anything but back to the story so one particular busy day im standing there ripping tickets of people entering the door fun these two middleaged entitled women come up and hand me their tickets i look at the tickets and say that will be theater six third on the right i rip their ticket hold on to half and hold my hand out to give them their ticket stubs they look at me blankly and say you throw them out me well its kind of busy today it would really help if you could hold on to your stubs just in case you want need to walk out for a little bit they respond well youll just have to remember us then and then the special snowflakes went off to their movie im just standing there saying to myself happy to be your trash can fast forward a half hour my manager comes over to me with my replacement cuts me i never minded leaving early from that job and tells me to get a closing task a small task to do before you left for the day as im doing my closing task my manager comes up to me with you guessed it the two special snowflakes im guessing they left to use the bathroom and didnt say anything to the person watching door manager have you seen these women before i look at them pretending to have a puzzled look on my face one of the women say remember i told you that youll have to remember us me nope the manager made them re buy their tickets i had a smile on my face all the way home edit this was years ago and it was a matinee tickets were about bucks a piece 
as weird as the title sounds i promise i can explain recently i started working out at a hour gym since i work nights luckily this place is pretty new and not many people go their yet just about an hour ago am i arrived at the gym after work and expected not to see anybody there but there was a guy and a gal in their mid s i wasnt to bothered by this and continued to begin my workout and got on the treadmill to start my warm up from this position on the treadmill i can pretty much see everything going on in the gym so i happened to see the two working out the thing with hour gyms and gyms in general it is a largely important to clean your machine after your lift and re rack your weights these two were not doing either and to top it all off they were treating the gym like their own and giving each other kisses every now and again before i had the chance to finish my warm up and passive aggressively wipe up their machines after they finished they both ducked into one of the two bathrooms i naively waited for a good minutes to see if maybe one needed to help the other use the bathroom or something like that but i really knew what was going on so i had to spoil their fun i chose the closest machine to the bathroom and did the heftiest most dramatic breathing noises and moans every single rep it was glorious i knew that even a dolphin who popped a carton of viagra couldnt keep it up during my moans i only had to do about sets of my moanercises before the two shuffled out of the bathroom while giving me death glares tldr i gained some muscle while he lost an erection edit apparently i came across as a bit jealous and autistic last night while writting this i didnt have a problem with people being at a gym thats the point i did have a problem with the intensity of their kissing and making me feel uncomfortable i normally like to work out alone since the gym is pretty small and for that reason i work out after work at night most the people i see at the gym at night are doing the same thing as i which is coming to work out not make out

tldr trained for an olympic event at an unreasonable clients home causing great chagrin and achieving desired outcome this was back when i was and used to deliver newspapers in an apartment complex my job was to distribute them by pitching them at the doorstep of each apartment i pitched them at such a pace that they tap the door loud enough that an awake resident would hear it but quiet enough that a sleeping one wouldnt be awoken i performed this duty at in the morning every day for years without missing a day or being late i also took a lot of bullshit from the customers one friday while collecting dues an alreadyproblemcustomer decided to add another thing to her existing shoppinglist of random complaints about my service this time it was that i was not delivering the papers loudly enough crazy lady the paper has been late every day this week me no maam i can assure you it has never been late this week you never threw them against my door i sit with my coffee waiting to hear the paper land and i never heard them this is the crazylady nonsense part of the story after years of the same route you know exactly what to do and the subtle nuances of every customer you know whos awake at you know who sleeps till you know whos unemployed and is home of the time you know who needs the paper thrown louder you know the ones that dont want it thrown at all hell you even know the ones that want the paper separated into sections and slid under the door maam i have always placed them at your door so that it makes a sound i do it the same way for you every day perhaps you just didnt hear the noises perhaps you were in another room at the time she was starting to sound more terse clearly this woman is trying for a fight ooooooooooh no i sit here every day with my coffee at waiting for you to come and you never made the noise maam i did make the noise i do it for you the same way every day and besides if you dont hear the noise you can just check to see if its there it will be there before am guaranteed but i need to hear it loudly thats your job i pay for my papers you are supposed to deliver them so i can hear them ok at this point i have exhausted all reasonable suggestions and have concluded that this tale is clearly more bullshit from a nutjob that just wants to hassle me at this point i figured i had walked her down the path of reason far enough and i was ready to let her step in the shit are you sure i can make it extra loud so youll be sure hear it yes make it loud so i can hear it i knew what i was going to do i thought to myself thank goodness tomorrow is saturday i collected her dues thanked her and smiled i arrived extra early the next morning to deliver the saturday papers times the thickness and times the weight of a daily i delivered every paper in the complex before hers and saved it for last i imagined her sitting there in her nightie at her kitchen table ass cheeks clenched her bony knuckles grasping the am cup of coffee waiting for the paper to come and make the noise well it was about to make a noise i dropped the final paper hers into the bottom of the contractors trash bag that i had taken from my fathers garage i had formed what was effectively an olympic hammer device and began to build up momentum i dragged the bag behind me as i took steps and twisted my body and arms violently and launched with as much followthrough as i could muster the newspaper hammer toss at the base of her door booooooom i though the door was going to blow off its hinges the shock wave echoed down the painted cinderblock corridors rattling the light sconces the force of the blast caused her heavy door knocker to fly up and come pounding down against the strike plate over and over due to the reverberations the echo went on and on for at least seconds maybe more but i wasnt sticking around to find out i took the paper out of the contractor bag dropped it at the base of her door and headed for the hills she switched to automatic billing the next week so i would never collect dues from her in person again i knew exactly why
so my teenage son frequently forgets that he is supposed to clean the kitchen in the evening this is annoying not just because it is gross to wake up to a messy kitchen but also because he is constantly complaining that we dont treat him more like an adult he is a smart kid but he doesnt seem to understand that adults dont get to do whatever they want if he wants to be treated like an adult he needs to man up and take care of his obligations right last night again he didnt clean the kitchen and he didnt have time to do it in the morning because he woke up late as usual so i loaded up the dishwasher myself and made sure to turn it on just as he started his shower ha no hot water for him this morning
im a passenger in my friends car when he mentions that the guy behind him is driving really close i begin to watch this guy ride his bumper for the next few miles traffic is bad so theres really nowhere for him to go we end up driving by a small group of pretty girls in summer wear my head turns but my friend hits his brake pedal just hard enough to turn on his brake lights the tailgater was watching the girls and when he turned to look at the road slammed on his brakes the effort caused him to lose grip on his slurpee which landed on the dash splashing the windshield id like to say he stopped tailgating but he turned off the clean up and we had a good laugh

once upon a time i was a graduate student in a liberal arts field now the department i was in was to put it mildly rife with squabbling petty professors more concerned with marking their territory and playing favorites among the grad students one professor had it in for me she didnt much like my theoretical approach that i took in one of her seminars nor did she like my prospective dissertation adviser every two years in a graduate students time there they undergo a review at my fourthyear review as i was told later on by a professor who i was friendly with she complained about me being a misogynist a comment that was entirely out of line and that no one backed up at the meeting at any rate within a year i decided to transition out of academia into a field that made moneydoing course management for the it team of my university but i still harbored a grudge at being maligned one of the systems that i maintain governs the uploading of syllabi to meet a state mandate its a balky system and occasionally has issues with crosslisted courses that end up in requiring me to to go manually fix them for the faculty once i learned the system i saw my path of revengei crosslisted this professors courses which never were crosslisted in the first place with a test course meaning that every time she tried to upload she had an error message saying that she needed to contact the system maintainer for help so she sent an email to the general address for this and i was able to respond firstname she loathed being called anything except dr lastname its rather odd that you had this error but i have been able to fix this problem for you you may go ahead and upload your syllabus teuker i never saw her face after she got the emails ive done this for the last two semesters but it warmed my heart to know that i was able to inconvenience her in just the smallest of ways

i worked at a large restaurant where it was policy to help other servers clear their tables and get refills on drinks when you could not only was it policy but it was a nice thing to do to help your coworkers i had this lazy bitch of a woman working with me one evening she was the only person who didnt help other servers at all in fact i think she put more effort into not helping then the actual act of helping would have taken there was another policy at this restaurant where you cant leave until the closing server checks your section and your side duties to make sure they are all done now this lazy bitch jen was best friends with the usual closing server amy jen usually got to leave early without cleaning her section leaving the mess for other servers to clean up before amy would allow them to leave one day i was called in to close the restaurant it was amys birthday and they needed someone to cover her shift that she booked off i jumped at the opportunity mainly because it meant more money but also because i knew jen was working that evening i cut all servers except jen i made sure that each of their sections were left messy and their side duties were not done they were fine with leaving a mess for jen because she had done it to them so many times when jens last table left she came and asked me to sign her out i checked and every section was still an absolute mess including hers and none of her sideduties were done i told her that needed to change before she could leave and she whined about needing to leave soon so she could make it to amys party i shrugged in the same noncaring way she had so many times and told her that she better hurry up then she rushed and did a halfass job of everything i checked it with a fine tooth comb and made her redo it again she did a halfass job so i made her redo it then a third time it still was pretty bad so i explained that she is just wasting her time by doing it halfass finally after the fourth time she was done i let her leave but it took her three hours to do that and she missed the better part of the party the next day i showed up to my normal nonclose shift and noticed i was listed as the closer the manager said the place was so much cleaner than when amy does it so they were going to bump me up to the closing server position and try it out for awhile that night i did the same thing where i allowed servers to leave without doing their cleaning so that amy would be stuck with it she bitched but i played stupid to whole ordeal and made her stay very late doing a thorough cleaning i did this day after day to both jen and amy whoever was scheduled to be there later finally one of them complained the manager told me they complained and said i understand exactly why youre doing that and they deserve it after about a month of that they both quit the managers were not disappointed and the other servers were happy we went back to being a very helpful group that never stuck each other with someones elses work tldr two lazy bitches used their impromptu power to screw over other staff i returned the favor until they quit 
not a long one but sufficiently petty i was attempting to back out of a parking spot at an ice cream parlor in a very affluent part of town i happened to have a spot right in front of the shop and while there were no other free spaces open anywhere up and down right in front of the shops the back rows of the parking lot were essentially empty like any good freedomloving american i checked to make sure there were no oncoming cars and then i proceeded to back out from out of thin air this black lowriding sports car probably driven by a communist appears and nearly hits me while im backed out into the street i stop hard and pull forward again while the sports car doesnt even decelerate in the slightest she only begins to acknowledge my existence when she realizes that oh right im here for a parking spot and that guy was about to surrender a prime one well shes already past me at this point and ive once again begun to reverse out into the street well guess who decides to almost hit me a second time the answer is mrs stalin once again im out into the road when she reverses back and i have to stop abruptly and once again i pull forward and she passes me completely but then she stops and waits now despite being home schooled i realize what social injustice is happening here and i decide that she doesnt deserve my glorious real estate even though parking lots are pretty much the ultimate form of socialism am i right so i hold my foot on the brake and she waits i wait some more and she waits too i look back at her and she puts her turn signal on i put my car in park and just sit there for a while pondering life the universe and pretty much everything but mainly im just staring at her through my window she starts to make violent waving hand motions at me from behind the wheel i suddenly realize i havent checked facebook in minutes and so i proceed to do so that was about the time lady lenin started to honk at me and not just honk but lay on the horn obnoxiously of course at this point no one else in the shopping center has any clue whats happening they all look to see this karlita marx just honking for no particular reason in the middle of the road and by this point theres a line of cars piled up behind fergie castro okay now im reaching and they all start honking at her embarrassed and defeated girl hitler gives up and goes literally around the corner to the row behind us and parks which prompts me to back up and give my spot to the lovely hispanic family in the suv who were waiting patiently next in line tldr the ghost of abraham lincoln teams up with the avengers to stop an assassination attempt on neil degrasse tyson tonight on fox edit gramma an spellins

this old story was from my time in college in that dorm laundry facilities were on every other floor each having two washers and two dryers i had dropped off a load of laundry at each of the washers and headed back down to my room for a bit i came back as the load in washer was just finishing up final spin cycle washer was washing someone elses clothes mine were in a pile on the floor i move the clean clothes to the dryer and the floor clothes to washer cursing out whoever did this my clothes were soaking wet and still full of soap about this time the revenge gods smiled on me the buildings custodian popped her head in and worried asked if i had clothing in washer turns out it was out of order after the wash cycle but before the first spin it would turn off someone from opp was literally on their way over to fix it considering that it wasnt going to rinse out i decided to help the person who had dumped my clothing on the floor i poured an extra three or four cups of detergent in the washer i sat with my laundry putting the load from washer in the dryer the original culprit nowhere to be found and headed back down to my room i immediately told my roomate the story and she decided this vengence wasnt enough she decided to wash her sheets so that washer would be taken up sure enough shes sitting there when the girl from the next floor up comes to check on her laundry shes shocked that her laundry is still wet and sudsy and bitches to my roomate that someone probably stopped the machine she tells my roomate that earlier she had come in to find that someone had left their laundry sitting in the washer so she took their clothes out my roomate plays stupid acting like she didnt know whose laundry she dumped or that washer was malfunctioning so the bitch restarts her machine and leaves again as soon as she is gone my roomate dumps another two cups of detergent in her washer for good measure about this time opp shows up to repair the machine he halts it but at first doesnt take the laundry out my roomate is innocently waiting for her loads of laundry to finish upstairs bitch comes back down to the laundry room and asks whats up with the washer opp guy says he probably will have it fixed in a minute then run her load through that she doesnt have to worry about it she leaves opp tinkers around a bit more then says to my roomate that to make repairs it turns out hell need to take the laundry out he asks if she has something for him to put the wet laundry in my roomate being the helpful sort runs back to our room fills me in quickly and grabs a cardboard box she pulls the soaking wet sudsy and slimy with soap clothes from the washer and put them in the box for him meanwhile ive gone to a friend on the floor and im telling her this whole story and she decides she wants to get involved she grabs up a load of laundry the second my roomates load is done she dumps her laundry in so upstairs bitch comes back down to the laundry room to find washer disassembled washer taken up by another person and her clothing all wet and gross in a box thanks to the different people and the fact that university staff is there theres no way she could suspect the conspiracy against her she says shes going to try to use another floors laundry and takes the box and leaves five minutes later shes down again both washers upstairs were in use and people have more laundry queued up during the trip up and down though the water and soap had started to soak through the box so by this point shes handling this soggy mess barely containing her clothing she plops it down orders my friend not to load anymore laundry when she was done with this load and leaves again opp guy ends up putting an out of order sign on washer and leaving i dont think he ever knew what was up my friend unloads her last load and is about to leave when another girl who we didnt even know and who honestly was just there to do laundry comes and puts her laundry in washer taking the space from upstairs girl by this point the sides on the wet cardboard box are splitting from the weight of the laundry and no doubt her clothes would soon be on the floor right where she dumped mine so thats what happens when the stars aligns friends pitch in and fate wants someone to have horrible horrible petty karma come their way

i submitted pictures to rtruecreepy about animals digging at my bedroom window about a month i couldnt figure out why animals were clawing at my window but it became nightly almost immediately after that post well my crawlspace was locked by maintenance because homeless people were having sex in it after they locked it up my roommates and i havent touched the room though apparently maintenance gave the other duplex a key as well even though it isnt their crawlspace what does the duplex do stop paying for trash and put their garbage under my bedroom today i found the mountain of garbage bags under my room after seeing the crawlspace door open and a fresh bag sitting inside i waited until i knew they were done putting their garbage in my storage area then i approached them and said hey guys what the fuck i have complained about the animals fucking with me at night and you never said anything about putting your garbage under my room the girl i was talking to goes yeahit smells really bad tooand there are a lot of bugs well yeahnow get it the fuck out she tells me we dont have garbage cans so we have been missing garbage day and didnt want to put it on our porch because it all smells so bad i said take all of mine i dont care we dont use them because we take our trash to the dump this is not okay i have animals messing with my windows this also explains our massive bug problem and likely mice what does this fucking idiot do put the cans in the crawlspace and lean more garbage against them wow that is impressive then after calling my landlord and chatting with him i removed all of their garbage bag by bag there was at least a months worth in there i sat each bag down on their porch right outside of their door some bags had gigantic chewholes from all of the animals feasting every night under my bedroom the bags that didnt well i made big holes at the bottom the length of the bags so when you set it down they wont see that they have holes then when they pick them up their fucking garbage goes everywhere then i set the empty cans right next to all of the bags fuck you asshole neighbors edit and update i keep getting an assload of update requests but i was at work and couldnt immediately serve up so i got to take pictures after i got off work imsorryimsorryimsorry op has a life she has to go to during daytime hours to afford redditting at night but here are the pictures i took upon arriving there are pictures from inside and out of the crawlspace that show garbage still left behind that i did not want to even touch there is also a picture to give context and proof that the crawlspace is indeed right underneath my bedroom i was texting with my landlord this afternoon apparently he went over and talked to them which i think is why the garbage has been pushed into a corner of their porch they still obviously have bags stacked but i assure you the ones in the trash can were probably a mess to get back together he took away their key to the crawlspace and is apparently going to be talking to their parents because theyre all young and needed cosigners to the house he is also buying poison and setting it out tonight for the rats that are in the area and its being sprayed for bugs sometime this week im ashamed as op that i could not see them pick up their garbage but i still find joy in knowing that they probably had a field day picking up all of their decaying shit off of their porch

we didnt mean for this to happen but were so glad it did i was fourteen during november of my freshman year of high school i had been grounded a few days before by my mother so i was surprised when she gave me the phone after i got off the bus mom call mandy me i thought i was grounded mom call mandy my best friend mandy and i went to different high schools so she would get home before me which is why i missed her call i called her and she was crying she told me her parents were getting divorced she had been talking about how for the last few weeks the piano tuner from their church had been coming by a lot lately to tune their piano but mandy had caught his hand on her moms leg once while they were talking at the table mandys dad found out she had been cheating and asked for a divorce luckily it was a friday so i asked my mom if i could sleep over there her mother was moving out the next morning and piano tuner was going to be helping her mandy wanted to stay at her house while they moved out because her dad would be out on business and she wanted to be sure her mom and piano tuner didnt take anything that wasnt theirs i figured she needed all the help and support she could get whenever we had sleepovers we would bake a cake cookies cupcakes or whatever we had on hand we woke up early and decided to make cinnamon streusel for breakfast we were mixing our second batch when one of mandys dogs leaped up and snagged two muffins we didnt want him getting sick and he knew how to get in the trash if he wanted to so we put the two muffins on a separate plate so we would know which ones had been slobbered on this entire time piano tuner and mandys mom were walking through the house to bring her stuff to the car we went back to distracting ourselves from them then both of us saw in our peripheral vision piano tuner snagging a muffin and walking away triumphantly after he left the house we checked and it was a slobbery muffin that he took we were in a fit of giggles we poured the rest of the batch into the muffin tin and we tried not to laugh as he took another on his way back in we checked again and he took the other slobbery muffin at that point we couldnt stop laughing as he was leaving he had the audacity to ask us why we were laughing we said it was nothing and put more muffins in the oven since then mandys mom married piano tuner but she wants to leave him now too for the past nine years cinnamon steusel muffins has been an inside joke of ours
this story happened a couple decades ago but it still gives me the warm and fuzzies when i think about it when i was growing up i got sick a lot constant headaches several episodes a year of vomiting for days got a cold every time it was going around etc after a few years of this i grew to learn and recognize the feelings that preceded getting sick or how to tell if a certain tastesmellsensation would make me feel better or worse when i was in elementary school i was home feeling sick my mom was irritated she didnt want to deal with me moping around and whining pathetically i was feeling nauseous and really didnt want to throw up she kept telling me to take some pepto bismol since it would make me feel better being someone who had taken a lot of it in the past i could vividly imagine the taste and texture of both the liquid and the chewables and i knew it would make me puke she kept insisting i kept refusing eventually she decided to force her hand i dont think she poured any down my throat but i think she yelled and intimidated my small self into taking some and loomed over me to make sure i finished all of it now something i havent mentioned is that just a few days earlier she had paid to have all of our white carpets in the house professionally cleaned this was a fairly big undertaking and took some time and money almost right away after being forced to ingest pepto bismol i knew vomiting was going to happen i ran i honestly tried to make it to the bathroom or at least to a trash can along the way instead i only made it as far as the hallway right outside of my moms bedroom door hot pink vomit poured out of me all over the freshly cleaned white carpet hot pink vomit right outside her bedroom you know that feeling right after you throw up where for a brief moment all you feel is that fantastic sensation of absolute relief i experienced that times ten for it was layered on top of the sweet feeling of vindication of knowing that i was right i told her it would make me throw up but did she listen try getting that out of your carpet
hold onto your butts kiddies this is gonna be a long ride so i was working one of those big bike stores you know with tons of bike stuff and a full service counter i was an assembler and a jr mechanic at times i was never good as the two older guys who worked there well it was nearing the end of the day and the two older guys had left a bit early because they had finished all the big projects that day i was left with some easy stuff wheel changes trip computer installation and a few final builds to have out on the floor a guy comes in forshadowing and asks how much it would be to put on a seat and a handlebar on his bike we of course had our prices on a giant board but most people dont look anyways so i told him it would be around he didnt seem very happy but said that was ok he says he will go get the bike out of his car what he brought in was a bike in a box as in completely unassembled me sir this bike is in a box old cranky bastard ocb and me sir this is more than putting a seat and handlebars on a bike ocb well the wheels but i was expecting you to do that for free just the wheels would be a service charge in itself me well sir as you can see on our price board a full assembly is ocb what that is not the price you quoted me what is this an insurance company me sir you told be it was just a seat and a handlebar for a full assembly we have to connect everything make sure it all is in working order and perform our safety check ocb i dont want any of that shit just put it fucking together me i am sorry but i will have to charge you for that i cant bend the rules with the saftey checks ocb where is your manager me he is at the front desk now this manager was a nice guy not really a pushover or anything but would tend to side with the customers on most things he was pretty good at finding a compromise however a few miniuets later the manager walks back and says why are you trying to charge for a seat and handlebars its important to note that he sounded more confused as to why i was doing this than angry i just pointed to the bike in an old peugeot box manager walks right back to the customer who had stayed in the front i dont go up there because i dont want to deal with this guy after a few minuets of yelling and grumbling manager and the guy comes back manager says to assemble thea bike and we will give him a discount to make the price now i am not really happy that we had to cater to this guy but i dont sign the checks doesnt really matter too much to me how much we make off of him he still looks pissed however so i get to work on this ancient peugeot bike i am super happy the screws and everything were in a little bag because they were all older types we dont really carry this is important anyways after working on this bike for around minuets the guy storms back in and asks if we are finished yet of course we arent he then starts screaming at us to take it all apart he found a different store that would do it all for dollars then comes screaming allegations of ripping him off telling us that we are just wage monkeys he actually said that haha my manager is pissed at this point and just wants him out so he tells me to rip it apart and shoves it back in the box which is exactly what i did i took this thing apart in the most heinous way possible shoving everything into the box they guy had gone back out to his car to wait on us to take it apart i was pissed at this dude for wasting my time manager was pissed for the lost time and money other employee was pissed because they guy was an assjack so every fifth screw i took off disappeared into the garbage whoops looks like he will have to pay extra for specialty screws i started to feel a little bad about it until i took the box out to his car he told me i wouldnt amount to much and i just just serve burgers or something he actually told me that the icing on the cake was a phone call we got e next day from said other store apparently he was saying that we would do it for less than them and they were flabbergasted guess what he had told them that he had just wanted a seat and handlebars put on tldr we find the magical world of narnia in the back room mr tubkins gets shot with a spear gun edited because words be hard yo

so about a year ago they subdivided one of my neighbors propertys and problems ensued so where i live there were three now four houses sharing the same driveway with a fence on both sides so there is nowhere else to go now the guy who was building the house came over to my place on day one and explained that heres my number to call and i will be here the whole time except for my two week vacation in a month well to build a house it requires a lot of truckloads of cement and various things generally the days that they did this they would go to all of the neighbors houses early in the morning to give them some time to move their car out onto the street so they werent blocked in a month later while the guy who i have the contact details for is on vacation i drive down the driveway turn the corner its an l shape and find a fracking massive gravel truck there just pulled up now theres space for the truck to move off the driveway but he looked new and probably didnt understand the situation so i get out of my car as he gets out of his cab walk up to him and politely ask him if he can move the truck off the driveway so we can get access he just looks at me and goes fuck off kid real men doing work here i aint movin i say it again being serious this time and say that i have somewhere to be and that they arent following the access policy which all the houses signed i get told to fuck off yet again and then the guy starts to try to threaten me so i walk away and think how will i get to meet up with my friends for movie marathon awesome btw so a few texts later my friends pull into my driveway as instructed by me and park directly behind his truck blocking him in he had no way out my friends jump out lock their cars and walk towards my place guy comes out shouting you cant park there this is an active construction site this is illegal i will call the cops i walk up to him say that since this is now a parking lot according to you i will park here as i have the right to use it and to top it off i inform him that what he is doing is illegal and im not as i own the land that were standing on one and a half hours later when we need to go get more supplies we find him in his cab fuming to the site manager on holiday and being told that hes in the wrong we go somewhere in our cars come back and of course hes gone when the site manager gets back he comes with the truck driver and they both apologize to me even gave me a half dozen beers as a apology gift best feeling ever tdlr guy blocked my driveway i blocked him in as payback he had to apologize to me and give me beer 
so this happened to me yesterday on my way home from school we were in a two lane road with a lot of traffic and i was with my family in the car we needed to merge onto the right lane so we turned on the turn signal etc and tried to merge at the last second some bitch talking on an iphone cut us off and yelled fuck you out the window we ended up merging right behind her lo and behold her car failed right at that spot dead battery no ignition etc now revenge time as we pulled out from behind them i told the entire family to smile and wave boys she absolutely lost her shit and started punching the steering wheel it was absolutely wonderful tldr be rude i will kill you with kindness

while at the store with my wife a while back picking up stuff to throw on the grill an opportunity presented itself that i just couldnt pass up the store was not terribly crowded and only one lane was open to check out while we were walking up to stand in line a woman came from behind us at a near jog with a cart overflowing with stuff and of course cut right in front of us before we could get in line i get it fair is fair and we werent in line yet but it was still a jerk move i mean we only had a dozen or so items but rather than make a big deal of it i had a better idea i turned to my wife and in a voice loud enough for ms impatience to hear said figures we get all the way down here and they open the first lane up no one even in line ms impatience hears this and without looking takes off to the newly opened lane i calmly push my cart up and snicker to myself less than a minute later ms impatience comes back giving me the dirtiest look i have seen since i farted in the car on a family road trip while it was raining i put on a straight face looked at my wife and said hmm guess it wasnt open after all
i work a hour a day days on days off job every rd on week i work nights at nights and on weekends there are no more than people in our story building the parking garage and our office building have a drive that passes between them the closest parking spots are building management spots that are full monday though friday but night and weekends they are empty i parked in one of those spots and carried lunch at midnight on a saturday in for my coworker and i the went out a couple hours later to get something out of my car and find a warning ticket that said a notice had been sent to my supervisor and his boss and i would have to pay a fine if it happened again petty revenge i knew the security guard always parked his car in the drive between the office building and the parking garage in a posted no parking fire zone area i called the cops and told them that they were parked in a fire zone and had been all weekend within an hour i watched from my window as a cop was outside writing him a ticket edit i have always subscribed to the theory that you catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar and have always asked the guard if i could pick him up something to eat when i go out to get food i usually bring my lunch since it is hard to find something other than fast food at midnight i have always declined his money when i brought him something and this night he had said no he didnt need anything i have not even asked him since this incident 
hi danginadeluxe here i am seldom petty nor vengeful but i have a couple coworkers whove inspired me to go the extra feet to mess with i work as a cook at a restaurant five days a week i show up as scheduled at am this is not the case for any of my coworkers to a person the opening staff will trickle in minutes late usually hung over if not still a wee bit drunk every morning i have to do these losers jobs until they show up without fail these weezing bags of dicktips show up pour a cup of coffee and hope itll help them function which it usually does after a several since im there first i make the coffee and i tend to make it strong for them because i used to be a nice guy until today because i show up well rested fed and ready i dont give two fucks about caffeine so today i made a nice batch of decaf instead it was glorious the hangovers wouldnt go away cognitive functions remained impaired they all simultaneously had shitty days one guy had to leave early it was everything i could do to not laugh out loud seriously i dont hate these guys but if even one of them thought today sucked maybe i shouldnt drink so much tonight then it was worth it fucking fucks
in light of getting pulled over as a passenger in a cab by power tripping cops i thought id share my petty revenge story from a few years back i was still an undergrad student at the time years of age it was summer and i was having me one of those summer romances i attended church every sunday back then and so was this girl i was infatuated with my church has a basketball court so id always have an extra set of clothes with me on sunday to change into after sweaty games of ball underwear and all we usually finished playing ball at around or when it gets dark out here during summer on this particular sunday we ended at eight and the sky was slowly edging toward night of course the girl stayed to watch me play and we hung out after being young and unable to keep it in my pants we eventually ended up fooling around and ended up in the bathroom of the church at this time theres no one there we get to fooling around and i have to ejaculate so she asks where am i going to come knowing that i have an extra pair of boxer briefs i calmly state dont worry ill just come into my underwear so i come in my underwear put on a new set of clothes threw my come filled underwear into my bag and we headed out our church is on the side of a hill and at the top in one of my friends neighborhood there is a beautiful view overlooking the city i thought itd be romantic so i drove us to the spot we chill in my car but hormones get the best of me and were having a hot and steamy make out session my car begins fogging up on the inside to the point where i could draw stuff on my windows and i couldnt even see outside suddenly bright lights flash in from behind my car oh shit cops i thought i quickly wiped down my window so i can see what it is behind me through my side view mirror i see someone walking up slowly my heart begins to race i hear a knock on the window and i open my door and get out i take a quick glance at their vehicle neighborhood security patrol car whew i thought they asked what we were doing and i just said kissing they took my drivers license and plate numbers gave me a warning and told me to leave i happily obliged i hastily wiped down the fog on my side of windshield and my female friend and i scuttled off i drove maybe feet before i noticed the distinct blue and red glow of police lights in my rear view mirror fuckin fuck i thought as i got pulled over by the actual police this time i roll my windows down placed my hands on the steering wheel and tried to be as mild mannered as possible the cop comes up with his flashlight shining in my face i see his partner behind him with his gun drawn why is it so foggy in here he questioned i dont know sir i replied are you guys doing drugs he asked no sir i replied get out of the vehicle the officer demanded as his partner now holstered his gun and began to walk towards the passenger side where my female friend was sitting she seems clearly flustered and frightened but knowing i didnt have anything that could incriminate me i was slightly calmer they walked us to the curb flashlights still pointed directly into my eyes put your hands behind your back the officer bellowed as he cuffed us and sat us on the curb at this point im getting extremely agitated as i feel this is clearly unnecessary and that these guys are just power tripping i mean the guy had his gun out before his partner even talked to me really so the officer asks can i search your vehicle knowing my right to refuse a search and knowing that i had nothing incriminating i sheepishly replied yes now im intently watching the officer as he combs through my car and lo and behold he gets to my bag i watch with eager anticipation as he begins to open it he shoves his hand inside and takes out the first thing his hand touches my come filled underwear i see him feel my come on his hands and confused as to what it is i watch him as he sniffs my come his face is overcome instantly with disgust as he just gently puts my bag and underwear back into my car he wipes his hand on his uniform and he and his partner speak for seconds before taking off the handcuffs and letting us go with a warning tldr indirectly made a power tripping cop touch feel and smell my come
standing in the supermarket browsing through the magazines waiting for my girlfriend who was in the restroom when a group of four teenage girls walked past they were your typical look at me girls you know caked in a thick layer of fake tan with bright bottle blond hair and wearing skirts the size of a tea bags just as they passed by me one of them pushed her friend into me causing me to stumble i turned round and told them to be more careful when the leader of the gang said to her friends amusement fuck off you fat peado i let this go as its not worth the bother and walked away only to hear them laughing saying thats right walk away fat boy i really wanted to kill the little fuckers but thought its best to leave it after meeting my girlfriend a few moments later i told her about these girls and how angry i was do you mean those girls over there she asked pointing in the group now hanging around the jewelry section yeah thats them well you should inform security on what they did better still tell security that you seen them put things under their clothes well bugger me my girlfriend is a evil genius so thats what we did went up to one of the guards and lied our arses off about these girls putting things like earrings and rings down their bras we hung about for a few moments to see the girls be surrounded by security and other staff members and be taken through the stores staff only doors at this point we made a bee line out of there so not to be asked any questions by staff we hung about a short distance from the store to see if the police would show up and not mins later two officers drove into the car park and made their way into the store im not sure if they did get stripped searched or not but i would like to think they did at least it would have put the end of their fun for the night and yeah looking back i know it was wrong given it was a waist of police time but honestly it felt so fucking good edit some people have commented about how i was wrong to do this to year old girlsor there about no where in my post did i mention their ages i simply said teenagers for the record the girls were at least eighteen years old possibly older some might even consider them adults and as for the folks saying i should have just walked away be honest with yourself if someone publicly branded you a pedophile would your first reaction be to walk away or might you just be angry enough to do something stupid like i did in the heat of the moment no well i envy you it must be so nice up there on that high pedestal good view huh 
for the past years i have worked for the same company without getting overly specific i market our material to agencies manage our media do some html coding and do graphic design work we are a small company and i am the resident tech person so i am a jack of all trades over the years i have grown to dislike the people that i work with immensely they have stolen my food i am gluten intolerant so i make the effort to make my own foodand people go through my lunch and eat it anyway stolen my tupperwear they are completely inconsiderate with my time they are condescending and i am routinely taken for granted i have gotten verbally assaulted more times than i can count and i am severely underpaid i cant even use them as a reference for future jobs because i simply cant trust them the person that had my position before me used my boss as a reference and my boss agreed to give him a good recommendation and i heard my boss trashing my predecesor to a potential employer over the phone super classy i am quitting this terrible job to go back to school when they hired my replacement they got someone as cheaply as they could and the person they chose didnt have any background in any kind of graphic designmediaweb they think so little of my job that they didnt think my replacement needed any experience whatsoever anyway training this new guy has been an absolute trainwreck in days hes nearly destroyed our website and he sent defective media to a sales rep and made a fool of her in a large meeting at this point i assumed that id train my replacement and say goodbye to this company for good with minimal drama they selected someone without a proper background they can deal with it last week had been busy since we have clients in and i brought my personal computer in to help with the load since my replacement has been on my company computer to learn the ropes i have brought my personal computer in before when we have been in a squeeze and i have been compensated a day nothing crazy i brought up compensation this time around and my boss gets in my face and says i didnt realize your computer came with a fee i thought you had been sharing the company computer with your replacement i had obviously not been sharing my company computer with my replacement since we had been working in entirely different offices my boss had even requested that i set up multiple webpages on my personal computer during this time he was playing dumb and lying to my face i didnt say anything because i knew whatever came out of my mouth at that moment wouldnt be constructive however i did think you have made a huge mistake i didnt bring my computer into work the next week and the entire workload was shifted to my replacement i was working in the respect that i was going over things that my replacement didnt understand which was a lot lol but i wasnt able to work independently since my replacement and myself were sharing one machine at one point my boss asked me why a project that he gave me wasnt done and i said well since i am sharing a computer with my replacement and hes been really busy with the clients i havent had a chance to get to it my boss looked unhappy but was unable to admit his mistake and by the time he realized the extent of his mistake it was too late since i wasnt there to shoulder the workload the underexperienced replacement floundered the entire company looked incompetent and we lost future jobs with the clients there were two clients which equates to hundreds of thousands of dollars lost that we had in our office i watched the world burn this past week was my last week and this was a sweet way to go out tldr i bring in my personal computer to help make a busy week more manageable my boss refused to offer the most minimal of compensation so i dont bring my computer in anymore and watch all hell break loose edit for clarity and more details

there are no bad actors here except perhaps the parents of the child but revenge was justified from the viewpoint of the perpetrator i was a witness only i was in a petting zoo area in a large municipal zoo very noticeable was a little girl in a white dress and white widebrimmed hat she was hugging the stuffing out of all the animals she wasnt trying to be mean she was just too young to appreciate that it was not pleasant to be a small animal and have your neck squeezed like it was a toothpaste tube on its last day this went on for a while i saw a young deer hiding behind a pole and watching her i wish i had had the stones to talk with her and try to curtail her enthusiastic hugs as i was walking about i heard a sound like something blown through a pipe i sensed something pass nearby me then i heard the crying looking around it appears that a llama who had been hugged shot a load of spit an amazing distance and hit the girl square in the head she had goo on her hat and dress a sad tale with no real bad guy but from that llamas perspective heshe served up petty revenge
my little brothers dad g used to emotionallymentally bully me when i was in middle school and this is a large part of why my mom is no longer with him i absolutely despise him ive never been an angry person but theres just something about him that brings out this rage inside of me out of respect for my little brother i dont speak about his dad whatsoever to him all i have to say is negative so theres no reason to say anything his dad needs people to like him to acknowledge his presence it drives him insane if youre not listening to what he has to say or if hes not in charge so ive just started ignoring him anytime i see him when he drops my little brother off and says hello mackhasarack how are you doing ill either continue on what im building in the garage and not acknowledge him or look up and then look back down at what i was doing ive been doing it for a few months now and hes been changing his tone and asking more questions to try and get me to reply but seeing it get at him makes it that much more enjoyable

excuse any formatting issues mobile user here so i work as a cashier at a familyfriendly entertainment center it has gokarts minigolf an arcadethe works so these two girls come in looking to be around and they want to go on the gokarts alright cool but its not cool when you start talking about how my coworker is a massive slut because shes dating a guy you have a crush on she told me this later i just figured there was something going on so they decide to do two races each which comes down to dollars apiece turns out they had dollars between the two of them but they wanted to get drinks because of their attitudes i didnt tell them about our deal in which they get two races for fifteen dollars the best part was when they started arguing because one girl had more money than the other and she wanted her to pay her back later but the girl with less money said the rich girl should just pay without compensation because were friends tldr i start a whoreoff over dollars

i graduated college about a month ago this story takes place after the commemoration ceremony after the event ended my parents wanted to go outside and take a picture with me in my cap and gown and all that fantastic stuff while my sister starts to take a picture of me and my parents a family walks in the shot completely disregarding the space behind my sister they could use to get by whats worse instead of continuing to walk to get out of the picture they just stopped there and start talking right in front of the camera where my sisters obviously trying to take our picture ok i think maybe theyre just really oblivious to their surroundings we move over a little so the group is out of the frame my sister tries to retake the picture but then an asshat man that was a part of that family started backing up into our frame while pulling his daughter in to a hug i make eye contact and he smiles he doesnt give a shit he sees the camera and knows weve been trying to take a picture hes just an asshole who doesnt care eventually after moving very far away from the asshats were able to get a few quick decent pictures while leaving the site my step father notices the same family who delayed our pictures is now trying to pose for their own graduation photos i think you know where this is going my step dad approaches them and waits until they are about to take the picture he then proceeds to walk very slowly in between the family and the photographer while proclaiming very loudly oh look its our turn to ruin their photos the rest of us were in tears for about minutes after i love my stepdad edited for grammar
the wife complained very early in our marriage you left the seat up i grew up with a brother and no sisters the seat was rarely down anyway from that day forward i make a conscious effort to put the lid and seat down my wonderful wife has had to lift the lid every time for years essentially the same effort she would have to put the seat down herself heck its much cleaner anyway
i was driving home the other day after a long days work when i enter a school zone i slow down because occasionally there is a cop hiding in the parking lot of the park im going mph when this douchebag in a shiny new red camaro is coming from behind me like a bat out of hell theres a car in the lane next to me so theres pretty much no way hes gonna pass at this point hes only about a foot or less away from hitting my car and revving his engine for me to move like the asshole he is i dont usually let people like that pass but i made an exception before switching to the other lane i checked to see if the cop was in his usual spot and goddamn did the petty revenge gods smile on me there he was waiting with his radar so i move out of the way to let the asshole through as soon as he passes the park going about mph faster than he shouldve been the cop pulls out of the parking lot an flashes his lights i cackled all the way home edit it seems some of you are thinking that when i say i slowed down because occasionally there is a cop that i went from mph this isnt the case i was doing about miles over the speed limit mph and slowed down because i entered a school zone its not worth it to me to throw away my life because of a kid running across the street and me not being able to stop edit how i felt afterwards 
i am not a coffee snob i just like fresh coffee at my old office i would bring my own coffee in from a local roaster as time went on i noticed my coffee was disappearing and the office bulk generic coffee was staying pretty full it didnt take long to realize that the whole office preferred fresh coffee as well i really didnt mind this i just wanted us all to share the cost if we were sharing the coffee i left a note on the bag asking for a small donation if brewing a batch the note disappeared again and again and no contributions were ever made finally frustrated and coffee budget near nill i extracted my revenge i hid my amazing coffee in a plain generic bag inspired by the bring potato chip commercial i then filled the original delicious coffee bag with decaf coffee enjoy your morning boost you cheap bastards tldr stolen coffee replaced with decaf bwa ha ha
this sub came to mind immediately after this occurred so i think its a fitting story a few weeks ago i was leaving the museum i work in after finishing a saturday morning class that i teach the neighborhood is busy at these times due to the artsfarmers market next door to our campus and people looking for parking so cars are going up and down the two lane street between our front entrance and our parking lot directly across luckily we have a traffic light and crosswalk joining the two that definitively indicates stop here for pedestrians i hit the button to cross light turns red street is totally clear and i start to cross at that moment a car approaches down the street surely he will slow down and stop nope not slowing aaaaannd there he goes through the light through the crosswalk past me and into our parking lot what the hell i wasnt in danger so i was just annoyed then as im walking to my car guess who i notice is following me to take my space no way man no way i walk deliberately to my car avoiding eye contact get in buckle up and start the engine making sure that the asshole driver is waiting for me to leave i then call my brother to have a chat and kill some time he doesnt answer but that doesnt stop me from pretending to be on the phone oblivious to the waiting car which is now holding up traffic this goes on for what must have been eternity to the other driver as he waited for the moment that would never come visibly frustrated he finally drives off i end my imaginary phone call and immediately reverse and leave the space he sees this and desperately tries to make his way around the parking lot but hampered by the oneway restrictions only makes it back to my space in time to watch another car take it was it petty of course was it satisfying absolutely forgive me a cruel chuckle 
during a flight from the uk to the us i was sat in an aisle seat minding my own business when the teen ish in the seat in front decides that rocking his seat is great fun he does this for a few minutes while chuckling and looking through the gap between the seats before i give him the try it again punk look he stops for a while until the meals were handed out tray down eating away the next thing i know is my drink is on my lap the kid has started rocking the chair again the attendant sees this and has a quiet word after getting me a new drink and apologising i did say no need to as it wasnt her he tries it again and i get up to tell him enough is enough he stops for about an hour after landing and as we start unloading our bags the attendant walks past proceeds to get a heavy bag out of the locker above the kid and drops it on him she apologises then looks at me and smiles as she walks away

ive got a lot of these stories for you guys im pretty vindictive but in true canadian form im also pretty passive aggressive this usually leads to lots of petty revenge this story though is by far my best revenge its long but its a good payoff when i was i moved across the country with my then boyfriend now husband i was pretty psyched when i got a job at aampampampampw because it was my first real job and the pay was really good great compared to my former province shit compared to the pay scale in this province i was working day shift and my manager told me it was very important to keep my own record of my hours because the computers didnt work to login after getting my first paycheque and being short hours i realized why it was so important but the owner assured me the hours would be on my next cheque i had worked there for about months before being promoted to evening manager with a fairly substantial raise of about ph i was still owed about hours of pay technically my boss always put my missing hours on the next cheque but then i would be missing even more hours from the current pay period things started getting really shitty some of our kitchen staff quit and instead of replacing them he just moved around the remaining kitchen staff so that we only had one person in the kitchen per shift we were also really short on staff so i ended up working the counters in the mornings alone and then coming in for my regular evening shift apparently my raise was only in name because my last paycheques had my former salary on them my boss assured me that it would be on the next cheque then came stampede for those of you who arent familiar with the calgary stampede its the biggest event in the city its a week long rodeo and festival where thousands of people flood the city drunk and wearing cowboy hats our aampampampampw was right downtown so needless to say it was a very busy week we still only had one kitchen staff and me working the morning shift the day manager came in early to help with the counter and we tried all the staff to see if we could get extra bodies but only one staff came in breakfast was a nightmare aampampampampw breakfasts are real breakfast made to order eggs bacon french toast none of it premade and there was no time to premake it anyway because the store was packed pretty much round the clock so with person full time in back and one floater it was taking minutes per breakfast and the store was lined to the doors and the drive through lined up right into the street we called the owner and told him he needed to come in right now because we needed him and his wife to help us we were drowning in angry customers minutes pass and we call him again ill be there right away is his famous line another minutes and hes not here we call his house and get vm so we assume he is on his way this is great because he doesnt live far so he should be here in minutes at the latest its now am hours since we first called and no answer on his house phone or his cell weve had lots of people walk out weve had people demand refunds and leave but the store is still packed and there is still an hour left on breakfast but we havent had a chance to prep lunch not even cut up the veggies for burgers so we were still fucked come lunch i look at the day manager and said fuck it i quit he says you know what fuck this i quit too we call the boss again and leave a message on both lines telling him we quit along with other staff the only one that doesnt is the kitchen staff and we will stay for another minutes to give him time to get here but then we are walking out minutes pass and no word from the owner we lock the doors and tell the customers in the store that their breakfast is free since they all have been waiting for so long and we are closing the store once all of them are served but they have to take their meals to go we serve at lease free breakfasts at around a piece once the store is empty we do our cash out drop it in the slot under the tills and get ready to leave people were still coming in the drive through and trying to get in he door confused to why the store would be closed in the middle of the day during stampede when i went in to return my uniform i made sure to get the money that we were all owed he paid us out of the till in cash because we refused to leave until he paid us it means that i ended up with about cash that was tax free so thats a bonus i didnt get a call until hours later after the lunch rush from my former boss claiming we owed him all the money he lost while the store was closedfor the free breakfasts i told him he was well informed about what was going to happen we knew he got the message because we had filled his inbox and couldnt leave any messages but when we called to tell him he store was closed the inbox was no longer full he shouldnt have tried to call our bluff because we werent bluffing he probably lost out on worth of sales or more from the store being closed for hours and missing the lunch rush which on a normal day brought in about g but during stampede could easily bring in this being calgary in i got another job the next day working as a secretary at parks canada making ph and never having to deal with cheap bosses or angry customers again 
a fairly new guy i work with alec hasnt quite gotten the job down yet ive given him the benefit of the doubt and have even defended him to my coworkers for some reason people have a hard time remembering his name is alec and often call him alex i always corrected people when they didnt say it right hes a pretty shy fellow but he opened up to me once about it and said he hates being called alex and that he appreciated when i corrected folks about it well i finished my shift a couple days ago and had to stick around and pull a double because alec dropped the ball and didnt come to work he ignored my phone calls and i ended up having to cover his shift until midnight ive been calling him alex ever since and now correct people when they call him alec 
i was out one night having a few drinks with some friends when i check my phone to see i had a dozen missed calls from a random number thinking nothing of it i continued my on with my night the next day i find out from a female friend why i had been getting all these calls i had told her in the past that if a guy was ever creepy towards her and asked for her number to just give him mine and id deal with him she was in a bar with a friend just enjoying themselves and having a few drinks this guy comes up to her and starts hitting on her immediately comes across as sleazy and arrogant hes making her and her friend so uncomfortable they decide to leave theyre on the third floor and its packed so it takes them a good ten minutes to worm their way through the crowd and down all the stairs douchebag follows them the entire way while the girls try to ignore him they get outside and he starts following them up the road theyre getting a little worried and its at this point he confirms their suspicions by yelling out its girls like you are the reason girls get raped so theyre pretty fucking scared at this point and dont know what to do so they both stop theyre in a crowded area so theyll be safer there than if they keep walking he catches up to them they start chatting and defuse the situation he asks for one of the girls numbers not wanting to give it to him she gives him mine instead he then calls her phone and demands to check it to make sure its ringing and she didnt give him a fake number somehow she convinces him it was right after hearing this story and realising he thought my number was my friends i decided to have a bit of fun with him throughout the week i sent him text messages pretending to be my friend apologising for being standoffish as i wasnt feeling well that night and yes i would love to see him again with the help of my female friend who he threatened we led him on majorly throughout the week for context he lived two hours away and was only in town for a special ocassion that night i somehow managed to convince this guy to get on a train for two hours book a hotel in the hopes of getting laid and come meet me in a bar at a pm pm roles around and im chilling in a bar down the road with some friends having a few drinks female friend was there with me waiting to see what happened he texts me that hes there at pm i let him stew for half an hour all while receiving texts and calls that i obviously didnt answer i send him one brief text that im running late and that ill be there soon it placates him for a while we manage to keep him there until pm alone in this bar its at this point we do the big reveal i send him a message saying from memory this isnt female friend this is her guy friend dont ever threaten to rape my friend or anyone else ever again if i hear about you doing anything like that again ill go straight to the police consider tonight a lesson as you can guess he went apeshit dozens of calls which went unanswered and abusive messages the best ones were when he threatened to have his cop buddy arrest me for some made up reason my group of friends all thought this was hilarious in the end we got his hopes up for a week and made him waste hundreds of dollars
ive worked with you before so i know what a backstabbing cunt you are you think you are hot shit because you work for the district and arent a regular teacher like us common folk you thought no one saw you roll your eyes at the questions the veteran teacher was asking during the workshop but i saw you you would never demean yourself to speak to her but if you had gotten outside your bubble for five minutes you would have learned she was a gifted teacher with years experience you work for a failing district one of the worst in the country you could have learned something from that woman but you were too busy being a snooty holierthanthou bitch she didnt see you rolling your eyes at her legitimate questions but i did well ive always been an overachiever i always show up ten minutes early for everything so while you were shoving your face with free cookies during the break i was in the classroom wiping some huge boogers on your louis vuitton 
the other day my mom asked me for some water it wouldnt have annoyed me normally but she was much closer to the water dispenser than i was so i only filled her glass up halfway take that
i live in downtown baltimore and the particular area im in has very limited parking especially on a saturday night i was driving around looking for a spot and miracle of miracles saw a huge space on the street enough for maybe even cars but it was on the other side of the road so i turn around and start going for it lo and behold the guy in front of me saw the same space and does the same thing i patiently wait for him to park he adjusts his car once twice then opens the door and leaves he was perfectly in the middle there was no space on either side of him to park i was livid it took me more minutes to find another spot much farther from my apartment and i was fuming the entire time i finally got home and tried to put it out of my mind a few minutes later the dog needed to be walked i took him around the block and he decided to poop right next to the guys car im willing to admit that the idea of writing choice epithets on his car crossed my mind however since petty is the name of the game i bagged up the poop nice and neat and gently laid the bag on his door handle no mess no smell but i hope he got the message
i have a neighbor that refuses to clean up after her huge ass dog as a dog owner myself i know picking up shit is gross but we live in an area that people walk barefoot her dog has shit the size of grown humans after numerous requests to clean it up shame talks about how others have stepped in it barefoot how it smells etc she still refuses to take care of her animal responsibly ive had enough i stepped in a fresh pile again this time in brand new shoes im fucking done i scooped up several huge pieces of her dogs shit and put them neatly on her door mat im hoping that she steps in it on her way inside her place she wont know who left it there because every neighbor has complained and we have several new people in our area i realllllly hope she steps in it i wont know for sure but damnthat would give me good feels for months update this is a townhouse type place so our units are connected we share a common parking area and lawn area in order to get into my place i have to walk near the lawn area her dog likes to shit on the sidewalk did i mention his shit is huge im not sure if she stepped in it she isnt the type of person to come over and tell me im out of town for a week but another neighbor is taking a turn while im away 
my alevel biology teacher told me she refused to assign me a coursework project because i missed the lesson where the coursework was arranged i had told her beforehand that id being absent to go to my brothers funeral she shouted at me for minutes saying i wasnt her responsibility that i didnt take my education seriously and id have to get zero for the coursework element which meant losing every time i opened my mouth to suggest a solution she got angrier i went to speak to the head of science who was shocked at how shed treated me and agreed id done nothing wrong my biology teacher kept being a bitch to me after that so i swapped her whiteboard pens for permanent markers she got through three quarters of the lesson before realizing even if i had got caught the ensuing meltdown was well worth it i started feeling sorry for her after she started crying so i told her going over it with a dry erase pen and rubbing it off might work she had to explain to the next teacher that he couldnt use one panel of the board because she used the wrong pens she spent the entire lunch break getting it off
may not be very petty but a pretty satisfying story i just remembered several years ago a major hurricane blew through my hometown and the government issued a damage repair to all houses effected by the storm after evaluation through insurance companies something to that extent construction contractors took advantage of the situation going door to door offering their services contractors get money everyone gets free repairs why not whole neighborhoods signed on and work began my parents were getting their home repaired and after a time realized the amount they were quoted for was too high so they planned to break the contract and find someone else to do all the repairs and replace all the shutters and window framing for the same price while on the phone with the contractor he tells them theyre willing to to do all the extra work for free so my parents stay with the original contractors after many many months the work was done and the guys came to collect except they didnt replace the shutters and window framing my father withholds the money because they admit to lying about the extra work in order to keep the contract but refuse to do it because they didnt write up the new contract for my dad to sign so theyre not obligated to do it yet wanted our money this devolved into arguments with them threatening to sue us a couple days later after discussing this with the family we have them over for a meeting and agree to pay them extra but discounted amount to do the shutters and framing they come back and finish the work when the time came for them to receive their pay they visit the house and my mother gives them the check they realize that the amount was for the original work without the additional pay as agreed they get pissed my mother snarkily replies to them that since they didnt sign a revised contract she was not obligated to pay them the extra amount they left without much of a fight tldr get it on paper
so last night my dad took me out to dinner at an indian restaurant just us my brother and mom dont like spicy food for a little context were dutch living in the us which is where this takes place when we ordered our food the waiter repeatedly corrected my dads pronunciation of the dishes we were getting and i could see him my dad getting slightly annoyed so when we got our food and the waiter asked if we wanted another round of drinks my dad ordered a dutch beer just so he could correct the way the waiter pronounced it he doesnt even like that type of beer all that much 
every morning before work i go to a drive through of some variety and get coffee because i am courteous i usually substantially lower my car radio when entering the drive though lane so people can hear the order taker and vice versa well this morning a special snowflake decided they should just cut me right off luckily i have good brakes and know how to drive in the rain and there wasnt an accident oh and a little added backgroundi drive a diesel mercedes they are not a quiet car to start with and on occasion ive been asked to kill my engine so the person wearing the headset can hear me so since you are clearly so much more important than me enjoy saying what what can you repeat that as i roll my window down and turn up the dance music i was enjoying

long but worth it i hope throwaway account in case anyone i know reads this prologue the rental situation in this city is horrific so i decide to save a little money by moving into a twobedroom apartment with a friend of a friend the situation begins to go south barely a month into our one year lease with new roommate lets call her klepto starting out by being just a little nuts and progressing into stealing my things clothes money cosmetics even underwear and i dont mean borrow without asking i mean disappear into her clutches never to be seen again instead of taking the penalty for breaking my lease i decide to wait out the rest of the year i buy a lock for my bedroom door and move most of my things into my bedroom except for sofa tv bluray etc which stay in the living room the story in the final days of our lease we each begin to move out when i come home from work and find kleptos things gone along with my tv bluray and everything else that she had had access to now none of this was brand new stuff most of it was my parents castoffs or second hand purchases but there was no way i could afford to replace them also i had no way to prove that these items were mine second hand i knew it would be her word against mine and when i called her demanding my things back this is exactly how it played out the revenge this could have been the end of just another bad roommate story but klepto had left one last precious thing to move out her wedding dress klepto was getting married in two months it was too good an opportunity to pass up and the dress went with me it didnt take too long to get the first phone call over the next few days i ignored at least thirty phone calls from her i was prepared to just trade for my things back but then i got a registered letter from a lawyer demanding the return of the dress i really didnt want to blow the issue up any further so i got out her beautiful delicate designer lace dress and prepared to return it i stuffed it into the smallest box possible about the size of a shoe box i could hear fabric ripping as i crammed it in but thats not it i just so happened to have a friend that was headed to europe and was very happy to put the dress in her suitcase when she arrived i had my friend send the dress cash on delivery i can only imagine the look on kleptos face as she finally got her dress days before her wedding and then not only had to pay for the delivery but also needed to get it cleaned pressed and prepared for her big day 
this morning i awoke to my sister showering in my shower i get up at to ensure that i make it to work on time it is very consistent and predictable for a little bit of petty revenge i jumped in the other shower and turned it as hot as it would allow we have a small hot water heater so this ran the tank empty in a matter of minutes and she loves long showers for an added bit of petty i ate the last donut for breakfast dont take my shower
my introverted best friend and i enter our favorite sandwich shop for a celebratory lunch and i tell him everything that we do today is on me he orders first while i figure out what succulent sub i want he finishes his order and pays before my sandwich comes out of the toaster i rush over and push him saying so its going to be that way cashier shoots me a quizzical look i tell her that its his birthday she tells us to wait as if we had a choice because shes holding our plates ransome and gathers what seems like all the employees to sing happy birthday best part cashier forgot to ask his name
i was exiting the freeway and there was a guy with a sign asking for help i rolled down my window and gave him a dollar he held the dollar up and said just a dollar just as he finished saying that i quickly grabbed it back and rolled up the window no dollar for you
full disclosure the car in question is a toyota yaris i know shes is a lame cheapass car but lucille is my baby and im very protective of her i was in the parking lot of a trader joes and a starbucks parked but still sitting in my car probably dicking around with my phone some guy in an enormous white pick up truck pulls into the parking spot next to me on my passengers side then opens his door bam straight into the side of my car twice he was so high up in the truck that he couldnt see that i was in my car and he got out and walked away without so much as looking to see if hed caused any damage so i backed out of the parking spot and pulled back into it this time so ridiculously close to his truck that no one could possibly open the drivers side door far enough to get in never mind this hefty beergutted dude then i got some coffee and watched from the window of starbucks as the guy returned to his truck looked confused walked in a circle or two around both our vehicles then ponderously hauled himself in through his passengers side door and over his center console touch lucille and i will slightly inconvenience you 
today i went to the beach the beach has sand i get this i fully expect to get sand in places i didnt even know existed however there was a kid who kept shovelingkicking sand onto my towel and myself i can deal with a couple times because hes just a kid and it happens but after almost a dozen timesnah son i got his attention and asked him to watch where hes throwing his sand building a sandcastle and his parents who i hadnt heard a peep out of the entire time turned to me and told me to stop telling their child what to do and that its just sand ok cool so i just let him keep kicking and throwing sand onto my towel i read my book ate my chips and people watched this went on for about two hours i had a decent amount of sand piled onto my towel by this time and then it was time to leave anyone who goes to the beach at least in nc knows that it can be pretty windy guess what way the wind was blowing i gathered my things and then picked up my towel but instead of being courteous and making it so sand didnt fly in their direction i just let loose it hit them all at once and the mom exclaims excuse you could you watch what youre doing to which my response was a cool its only sand ha hope it sticks to them for hours

i pulled up to the mall in the afternoon to catch a movie and i see this all black dodge charger double parked in the very first nonhandicapped row usually i dont really bother but i happened to have a pen and postit left over from work i wrote a little note on his drivers side window i keyed your car good luck finding it by the time i got done with the movie it was dark and i see the douche bag using his phone as a flashlight trying to find the scratch and huffing and puffing looking around to see if anyone was watchinglaughing at him i dont know how long he was there before i came back but i sat there and laughed from within my car for at least minutes and no i did not actually scratch his car
the setup while in college i also worked full time for the university it help desk as anyone who worked full time through college can tell you it can make scheduling time to talk to professors a bit tight so i had to become a pro at sneaking minutes here and there for questions about classwith a lot of walkandtalks and sent a lot of emails most professors were incredibly understanding one not so much the offense after class i approached the professor as he was packing up his stuff with some questions about a particularly complicated bit of material me hi sir i was wondering if i could ask you a quick question about something we went over last class prof im sorry no im very busy me of course i understand and i wouldnt want to hold you up id be happy to walk with you so i dont keep you from anything its just i tried emailing you an prof ugh i abhor email me right sure which is why i thought id ju prof look let me make it perfectly clear i have clearly defined office hours when you can come by and ask me any question your heart desires me of course its just that i work over at the help desk and my work schedule completely overlaps your office hours so i cant get by to prof yes yes that sounds like a terrible problem its just not my problem i have over students a semester if i let you encroach on my personal time then ill have to do the same for everyone and itd be chaos thats why keeping a schedule is so important me sigh of course sir ill figure it out note this little lecture on the importance of strict scheduling took longer than answering my question likely would have the revenge a week of so later in that same class the professor had barely started into the lecture when the podium he was running his powerpoint from threw a few errors and the display shut off a flurry of random button presses colorful language and a mournful this is why i hate computers later the prof was unable to get the display to come back up irritatedly his eyes swept the classroom until he found me prof you you work in it right do you know whats going on up here me of course sir prof well then get up here and get this going again me im sorry no the entire class spun to look at me and his eyes bulged prof no me thats correct sir you see i have very clearly defined work hours at the help desk if you want to come by during those id be happy to help its just that i support people each semester and if i provided support for you during my personal time id have to do it for everyone else and itd be chaos you understand right prof clearly mad but if you dont i cant me yes sir and thats a terrible problem its just not my problem im sure you understand as you told me just recently keeping to a schedule is very important the classroom was dead silent and the professor stood there seething with fury and staring me down and puffed up as if preparing for an epic meltdown then i saw the flash of recognition of he realized id just parroted back his own argument nearly verbatim and he just started laughing tears streaming down his face when he finally composed himself he just said fine you win you he stared narrowly at the rest of the class for emphasis and only you can ask me questions outside of office hours no one else now will you please come fix this me of course sir id be happy to epilogue while i was up front he leaned if real close to speak to me prof you know i could have kicked you out of my class for that right maybe even gotten you fired me sure but then i could have just remotely deleted every file on your hard drive destroying years of work you almost certainly dont keep backed up anywhere else prof wait you cant do that can you me i hope you never have to find out tldr professor refuses academic help to it nerd outside of office hours later has it problem in class nerd uses profs reasoning to refuse it help outside of work prof caves everyone wins
 ive lived in the same house for the last years its a two family house and my landlord is an ok guy but can be a dick about things when we first moved there we werent allowed any pets and could not park in the driveway i understand you dont want animals ruining the house and what not but his reasoning was his year old son is allergic to cats and dogs he lived in the basement we live on the top floor there is no way he would even be affected by any of the animals but your house your rules we also werent allowed to park in the driveway a bit of an annoyance because when we first moved in the landlord said it would not be a problem my mother being a single mom raising two kids didnt have a car at the time so that wasnt much of an issue for us fast forward a couple of years and we get a car but cant use the driveway my mother tells him he promised we could and the landlord says he never said that and we cant use it the rent goes up during the years and my mother speaks with him again and he says ok sure you can use it as long as it doesnt affect my daily routine my mother is out of the house by am every morning and he is a retired old man who usually does work around the house and will walk to the grocery store etc so it never messed up his routine a few months ago he tells us he we cant park in the driveway anymore because his sons need to go in and out and its an inconvenience to them they usually block the driveway do what they must and leave so i didnt understand what the issue was one of his sons lives in greece and has come to visit for about months my landlord being an old man does not have use for the internet and most likely doesnt know what it is but his son would like to check his emailsskype his familyprobably jerk off in general use his computer in order to do that you need wifi unfortunately for him im the only one who has the wifi password my mom and sister just ask me whenever they need help with computer stuff including setting up the wifi for their laptops the son asks my mother and sister and they both say you must speak to ashinkusher about that hes the only one who knows it a couple weeks go by and we see each other going in and out of the house and finally he asks me for the password along with the douchey allergic to all fucking animals brother finally i get my revenge and i refuse to use allow them access to my precious wifi because i dont feel comfortable letting others use it because of the risks to personal information and viruses blah blah blah plus i pay for it why the hell should they get to use it for free the look on their faces was priceless they were so angry but couldnt do a damn thing about it now if he wants to use the wifi he has to drive minutes to his brothers house and use it there
i decided to go grocery shopping actually i had decided to go buy some raspberries in the guise of grocery shopping hey two birds with one stone raspberries are my favorite food ever and they are quite a pickmeup when im having a bad day now i was almost done with my shopping and wheel my cart around to the produce section where i see the small fruit display with small stacked cartons of raspberries i eagerly made a beeline for them suddenly a lady comes up to them from the other side her cart blocking my way and taking up the small aisle in front of the raspberries i really wanted those berries so i just backed up a bit and patiently waited for her to be done she took a carton of berries then another and another and another and another and another i see her glance up at me and im not too worried im just happily waiting for a chance to swoop in a get a carton or two of my precious fruit but she goes on plucking up each carton and putting it into her cart internally im panicking surely this lady wouldnt take cartons of raspberries there are only a few left so i speak up um excuse me i ask nervously but politely she looks up then like that piece of shit kid that used to push all the other kids aside to take the last good ball went you went out for recess this lady this middleaged lady gave me the most triumphant obnoxious smirk lifted the last carton into her cart turned around and walked off outwardly i was shocked standing there with my mouth partway open flubbing quietly and thinking did did that grownass lady really just pull that shit inwardly i was screaming i was in a foul mood my main reason for shopping now ruined and i had a sinking feeling that my thirst for delicious raspberries would leave me feeling empty inside i make one last pitiful round to collect when i had forgotten and glumly pushed my cart up to the checkout counter to my annoyance as i looked up take a guess who i had ended up behind in line raspberry thief i was mad and i was about to pull out and go into another line however raspberry thief was busy fussing with her bag in line and didnt even notice me i glanced into the back of her cart only to realize that barely peeping out of the back were the crowning glory dozens of cartons of raspberries at this point i didnt even care very slowly carefully and quietly but without taking my eyes off her stupid back i reached into her cart and pulled out one two three cartons of delicious raspberries she failed to notice me and went ahead with her purchase but bitch i got my fruit suck it

i worked at a restaurant in a casino in vegas i dont want to get into complaining about tips and whatnot thats a different subreddit but i did get some nicely petty revenge one night it was a table with europeans i greeted them introduced myself gave everyone a menu told them the special and went through the drink menu a few minutes later i was standing in a corner chatting with a manager while watching my section it was obvious the big table was still going through the menus one man from the table walked up to the manager and told him that they had been here minutes had yet to see their server and had been trying to flag someone down to take their order none of this was true so he probably didnt recognize that i was his server i apologized profusely while knowing i was right and escorted him back to the table to take their order i offered to start with the ladies knowing no one was ready except for him i went to the mans wife and asked what she would like to drink she went red and asked me to skip her so did every single other woman at the table i went back to the guy who complained and asked if i should continue he told me to go away everyone was nice but him i bowed and scraped to not get a complaint but he made up for his first complaint going wrong by being unhappy with everything at the end he had a long talk with the manager who wouldnt tell me what was said he charged the check to his room and verified his identity with his passport and complained about the wait because they had the redeye flight out of vegas to catch now im a really nice guy i dont get upset over trivial things i know life and each night evens out in the end and i would never mess with someones food but when i picked up the check and saw his passport still insidei immediately had the urge to chase them through the casino to return it ive done it many times with cc or id instead i did what i was supposed to do and left it with the hostess who locked it in the managers office safe because we were about to close which means the earliest he could retrieve it was when we open at am the next day good luck catching your international flight
this happened more than years ago but after stumbling onto this subbreddit i wanted to share i was a senior in high school at the time i had already gotten all of my college stuff in and was in the process of finishing up all the work to finalize everything for the college i chose this was about weeks before christmas on a friday and i got my parents to sign a form for me to leave school early so i can get some christmas shopping done sweet i drive to the mall and buy all of the things i need and actually spent a lot less than i thought i was in the christmas spirit and just enjoying my day i get in my car and stop for gas feeling in a cheery mood i figured i would top my day off with a code red mountain dew slurpy from the gas station fuck it biggest size they got heading home there is this large bridge that i need to cross they happen to be doing construction on this bridge so after the first th of the bridge the outside lane is closed leaving only the middle lane i am at the light before the bridge in the middle lane light turns green and i continue on my way as i get to the point where the outside lane needs to merge i realize that this lady in a spiffy new mercedes sped right up on my right in the outside lane she must have hit the light at the right time where she didnt have to stop and still had a lot of speed however i was well ahead of her she tried speeding around me in the outside lane and almost pushed me into the wall trying to cut me off getting into the middle lane im annoyed and just continue driving and she gets behind me in my rear view mirror all i see are arm movements and middle fingers i passionately return one petty yes but i think its over until i get to the stop light at the other side the lady in the mercedes pulls up next to me and rolls down her window shouting at me i am now in the open outside lane making a left i roll down my window to return expletives of my own but i dont even get time to say anything she is yelling shit along the lines of you fucking teenagers dont know how to drive fucking inconsiderate kids these days just being a bitch because i wouldnt allow her to rudely cut me off im just annoyed at this point that this lady and her actions are putting so much negativity in my otherwise amazing day and dampening my holiday cheer rather than say anything i grab my huge tankard of code red slushie and throw it outside of my open window and it hits her passenger seat headrest and explodes everywhere ice cold bright red liquid goes everywhere all over her face all over her windows and most importantly all over the leather seats in her nice mercedes i give her a merry fucking christmas and continue my peaceful drive home i am so happy that the gas station offered such a massive and unreasonable size for their slurpees that day

i used to work at a chain fast food restaurant in the midwest the job in general sucked but one customer stands out in particular i was working on the drivethru window for the first time and ill admit i was a little stressed during the height of our lunch rush a car pulled up to the speaker with some shitty pop music blasting hi welcome to the driver shouted something garbled to me that i couldnt hear over the loud music so i said im sorry could you repeat that she shut the music off and practically shouted fuck are you deaf i want a number whatever her order was and a large chili did you want the number sandwich or the meal but she had already pulled up i rang up the sandwich alone since it was easier to change to a meal like that rather than the other way around she pulled up to the window which i opened so i could clarify her order before i could ask she immediately complained that i hadnt given her total to her questioning my intelligence all the while patience ebbing i rang in her correct order i want the damn meal duh with a diet coke and began gathering her meal together taking another order at the same time she shot me a look through the window making a gesture along the lines of hurry up as i was bagging her chili that was it contrary to popular belief restaurant workers are not likely to spitpisscome in your food as the risks far outweigh the reward and i would feel guilty if i did any of those things so i did the nextbest option she had a sandwich fries a drink and a large chili so rather than put a spoon in her bag i threw in two straws and a napkin i handed her bag out the window and gave her my perkiest have a nice day leaving her to drive off with a chili and nothing but a straw to eat it with maybe its petty but it still makes me giggle to this day tldr have fun eating chili through a straw asshole edit holy shit gold was unexpected for real thanks internet friend emmy speech 
last year i worked drivethru for a popular fast food chain the job was kinda shit by itself but the manager guys she was shit well call her deb because that was her real fucking name yelling at employees constantly cutting hours out of spite not honoring time off requests the whole nine yards she was just a nasty person i cannot honestly bring to mind any remotely positive interaction i had with her just god i needed the money and i didnt invest myself too much in my job i just did my thing and left thus i managed to tolerate deb for a while but after a particularly awful string of bullshit i went looking for another job i found one better pay better hours i wrote up a twoweek notice like a good employee and was planning on handing it in my next shift until i found out that deb had essentially forced my favorite coworker to quit he wanted saturday off to attend his grandmothers funeral deb said absolutely not after trying to negotiate and failing he informed deb that he no longer worked for the franchise i immediately knew what i was going to do i threw my notice in the trash for those of you that have never worked fast food corporate is always breathing down your neck if the customer does not get their food within seconds of ordering corporate knows about it immediately thanks to the miracle of technology they have their eye on all kinds of shit production times employee hours uhc tray times order accuracy i mean all kinds of shit you cant even toss out a chicken nugget that hit the floor without marking it down there are plenty of ways to get around this stuffresetting uhc tray timers hitting served before you actually push the burgers out the window and if you dont find ways to get around it your managers will hate you i was going to fuck that shit up pretty hardcore the revenge i went in for my final shift clocked in ten minutes early corporate alarm and got promptly yelled at by deb she turned and began walking away i waited till she was reasonably outside of earshot and quietly said i quit the grill guy heard me no one else did my ass was covered so i go to man booth the dinner rush is starting to pick up im getting a line problem is i dont work there anymore customers are asking me what the hell is going on and i basically say im so sorry but i just got let go im waiting for clearance to leave orders are piling up beside me but the assistant manager doesnt seem to notice as he had a tendency to get absorbed in his work cars are starting to pile up the line extends past the order menu and starts working its way around the parking lot the lady at my window has been waiting for her order for a few minutes now if only there was an actual employee manning the window the order screen has gone mysteriously blank why its as if cars cant make it to the screen to order which of course they cant because im not handing out any fucking food no one has noticed the empty screen because everyone is busy preparing for the next run and the dudes working the sandwich table were not exactly ivy league material again corporate keeps an eye on everything and nothing twists their titties worse than long wait times and when one order gets held up in drivethru theres this horrifying domino effect and a lot more orders get held up as well it takes seven minutes for the assistant manager to realize that something weird was going on not the assistant manager handing me the food but the one working on salads who knows how long i could have stood there if she didnt notice what clued her in was it the shiteating grin on my face that was growing larger every moment i will probably never know the answer but people started yelling and it took no time at all for deb to be right in my face she asked what the hell i was doing i informed her that i had quit she didnt seem to comprehend what i had said the first time and started bitching so i informed her once again that i quit there was a pause and i added that this customer had been waiting seven minutes for her order so deb should probably cover the window i have never seen someones face change that many colors so quickly she started flipping out why didnt i tell someone i did the grill guy heard me i was just covering this register so that no one could dip into the till it was a completely bs excuse and she knew it i was told to get the hillbilly fuck out of my store her actual words i went to the crew room to take off my uniform and she screamed now and then she screamed again something incomprehensible that was probably just a scream of rage everyone had gone dead quiet even the two girls on front cash that always chatted the night away it was surreal just straight up walking out of the store with my uniform on i went out the side door by the bathrooms going from that hot kitchen to the crisp autumn air seemed to underscore the extreme relief i felt walkling away from that job and that boss i cannot quite explain the sense of finality i felt driving out of the parking lot and knowing i never had to come back the aftermath i had friends on the inside so of course i got all the juicy details on how badly i screwed the place corporate was so furious that they sent a special probe team to look into things i was expecting some kind of letter in the mail but it never came apparently the grill guy hearing me quit and my absolutely bs excuse about guarding the register were good enough the corporate folks conducted individual interviews with every employee that was on that shift to figure out what happened it didnt take long for them to find out that everyone hated deb and that deb hated everyone back she was transferred to another store in the franchise and fired three months later for the record no coworkers were harmed in this little stunt everyone there hated the place and didnt really care of the paycheck the grill guy thought it was hilarious i never did turn in my uniform
when i was young my family did not regularly drink soda only our father had a constant supply and that was specifically for his work lunches of course being greedy kids my sister and i would sneak one from time to time getting rid of the evidence was a problem the sudden appearance of an empty can on the recycling was a dead give away my sister was always drinking far too many of my dads sodas and not removing the evidence properly which meant that my parents quickly noticed of course she also never admitted that it was her this led to both of us getting in trouble which is when i hatched my nefarious plan i drank my dads soda not too much but enough i would then hide the empty cans in my sisters closet one day my parents were in her room helping her with something and they opened her closet boom right there were multiple empty soda cans caught red handed no one believed her when she swore that she didnt drink them from that time on i was never suspected of drinking my dads precious soda
worked a park maintenance job one summer i was in my s but i was working with mostly teenagers the job was your usual grunt workweeding mowing removing trash cleaning bathrooms we had a little gator golfcarttypevehicle to help move the trash from the bins to the dumpster about half a mile away the park had a lake with a few and yearold lifeguards they were all bossy tan entitled rich kids they would often make fun of us for our toilet and trashrelated duties or try to steal the cart and theyd do donuts in the sand with it part of our job was to rake the beach smooth at the end of the day and we had to wait until everyone had left so having more raking longer later hours than we were scheduled for one time the lifeguard actually crashed the cart into a tree and put a huge dent in the bed and we were told that we were inches away from getting the cart taken away from us if we couldnt respect it hauling that much trash that far without the cart would be pretty unpleasant so me and my other maintenance buddy started trying to figure out a way to make their lives as difficult as they were making ours the lifeguards had two chairs one on each end of the beach maybe yards away from each other one of these chairs in particular was their favorite and it was designed in such a way that if there were an emergent situation youd need to jump from the chair rather than climb down it it looked something like but taller and more like a bench that multiple people could use at once for time immemorial lifeguards had employed a huge mound of sand under their favorite chair probably around tons so that they could jump into the sand and run down it to the lake the other chair was probably more like what you imagine a regular lifeguard chair to look like it was totally fine they just didnt like using it i think they they thought they looked more dramatic leaping from the chair and running into the water than climbing down like dorks their favorite chair was also closer to the bathrooms shade etc so one night after the lifeguards were done destroying the beach and all the visitors have left my buddy and i grab some shovels and start doing our jobflattening the beach totally level between the two of us and the golf cart we make quick work of itthe ish tons of sand was redistributed to an area between the two chairs just far enough away from the favorite chair so that it would be a major pain in the ass to try to move it back by hand we locked up the golf cart but left the maintenance closet open so they could use the shovels highfived and went home the next day when i arrived at work i could hear the lifeguards bitching all the way from the parking lot the male lifeguard had his one little shovel and he was scooping sand up one shovelful at a time walking yards back over to the chairlosing half of it along the wayand trying to rebuild the mound so they could use their favorite chair instead of the dorky one wheres the cart he was shouting i need it yeah buddy i know that feeling

a few years ago i used to work at a fairly decent waterside restaurant that served your standard burger fish and chips and seafood dishes one day a group of four people who looked pretty well to do walked into the restaurant our hostess seated them and i brought over their menus and asked if they would like anything to drink while they decided on dinner all demanded extremely specific mixed drinks with multiple extra garnishes on the side and a lobster dinner for the main course i could tell off the bat this was not going to be a fun table by the tone of their demands i walked over to the bartender with their drink orders and had the drinks made up according to plan before i even made it back to the table to set their drinks down two of the restaurant goers request i have the drinks remade because they were the wrong shade of color it was at this point my suspicions were confirmed i had a table of class a ass hats so begrudgingly i brought the drinks back to the bartender who had a good laugh about it and remade the drinks a touch of grenadine was all that was changed no petty revenge yet when i brought the drinks back the first two patrons were satisfied but at this point the other two started some complaints about the amount of garnishes in their drinksat this point i knew what had to be done as they whined about every detail my napkin is too small get me another can we have separate baskets of bread when it came time for the main course of which all had ordered lobster i accidentally left the butter sauce cups off the plates on each of their orders good luck eating your lobster without delicious butter sauce i didnt return to their table for a full minutes to make sure the lobster was good and cold before bringing the butter sauce i knew they would ask for 
i own a wooden shed in my backyard complaint after complaint was filed with the city by my local hoa that my wooden shed was the color of wood in fines later i was required to paint my shed within hours i was so friggen angry that i went to the hardware store and asked for the brightest color he could find on his chart and this is the result after a few months and seeing the avengers we changed it to this we now have a sign in the yard that says our house gets painted purple next time edit to those of you mentioning the purple house that was in the south side of milwaukee i live in milwaukee and that is where i got the idea from and the idea of the threat edit ive mentioned this in the comments but there isnt an actual hoa in my neighborhood what they are is a bunch of older retired folks with nothing else to do so they call the city until our neighborhood inspector comes out to cite one of the millions of obscure laws at his disposal so they stop calling him
im a college girl living in the type of dorm where everybody has their own room but shares a kitchen and a bathroom with several other people in my case i share with six and their friends are always coming in and out of our kitchen somebody or maybe multiple somebodies likes to borrow things from our kitchen without asking regardless of who they belong to ive had several things of mine disappear despite putting my name on everything and sticky notes on the cabinets asking people not to touch things that arent theirs sometimes i find things again plates i bought measuring cups once a banana but sometimes they disappear for good one thing that constantly gets borrowed is my salt with my name on it in sharpie sitting right behind a postit note asking people not to borrow my spices without asking first now i have plenty of salt i wont miss a few grains and i probably wont even use all of it before i move out at the end of the semester but its the principle of it that someone doesnt care to ask me before using something that obviously belongs to me i got tired of having to hunt down my salt all the time and finding it sitting in other peoples kitchens and i didnt know exactly who was taking it so i couldnt confront them i decided to teach a petty thief a petty lesson i poured my salt into a container marked rosemary and filled the salt container up with baking soda it doesnt look quite like salt but to someone who isnt looking closely its similar enough its not poisonous well not unless you ingest like tablespoons at once but it tastes pretty bad i put it back in the cabinet and waited unfortunately the end of the story is a bit anticlimactic my salt disappeared again a few days later but i was patient and whoever took it brought it back soon after this had never happened before its been a month and no one has touched it since while i happily just use the salt out of my rosemary shaker i still dont know who you are salt thief but i like to imagine you had a shitty meal and maybe even learned a lesson

my boyfriend and i were at the grocery store the other day and it was quite busy we had grabbed everything we needed and were waiting in line with about or people ahead of us after a few minutes this woman comes and get in line behind us she is there for no more than minutes before she starts shouting that they need to open another line dont know how to provide adequate customer service are incompetent etc she is repeating the same thing over and over and the cashier is visibly uncomfortable bear in mind of the registers are open the store is just very busy she goes on this tirade the entire time im in line i would have just ignored her i used to work in retail so i am good at tuning out assholes but she kept bumping my ankles with her cart as if to accent her point when we got up to the register the cashier noticed that the bag of discount halloween candy we were trying to buy had already been opened and some was missing ill be damned if i dont get the max amount possible of discounted goodness so my boyfriend runs to the back to get another bag at this point i am in front of my cart and the annoying woman behind us is leaning against her cart which is leaning against mine when my boyfriend gets back he politely tries to go around her she can obviously see him but just plants herself to wear he cant go around so he goes all the way around to get to the register again the woman lets out an exasperated sigh over how long we are taking it is at this point that my boyfriend looks up and realizes how her cart is perched on ours he proceeds to nonchalantly pull our cart forward which in turn causes her cart to fly forward and her to fall flat on her dumb face it took all i had to stifle laughter and she just stood up all huffy and redfaced she didnt speak another word
im a college student at a pretty small school students and as a small school we dont have too many options when it comes to food we do however have sushi for sale in our main cafesnack bar a local sushi restaurant makes a few different types of rolls each morning and sends them over theyre all pretty good but one the groll is above and beyond the rest of them my mouth waters just thinking about it tuna salmon yellowtail shrimp crab fish roe avocado and cucumber all rolled together into bites of pure deliciousness unfortunately the restaurant only sends over about or of these per day and they sell out fast last week i entered the cafe to get lunch and to my great excitement i saw there was one groll left on the display shelf i grabbed it off the shelf and was walking toward the cash register when a girl came up to me and whined oh no i was going for that those are my favorite i try to treat others how id like to be treated so i handed it to her and grabbed a few philadelphia rolls for myself no big deal the next day i again entered the cafe to see that there was again one groll left today was my lucky day i walked toward the shelf just to arrive at the same time as guess who the girl from the previous day i was reaching for the roll when her hand shot out and grabbed it right from under me i looked at her thinking maybe she didnt recognize me from the previous day but she just smiled and said i love these things and waltzed away now i was mad if i went out of my way to be nice to you i expect at least a little decency in return so today when i entered the cafe i was thrilled to see there were three grolls left i was finally going to get one however when i was approaching the shelf out of the corner of my eye i saw the same girl enter the cafe and start heading in my direction i sped up a little and reached the shelf about steps ahead of her i grabbed all three grolls turned around gave her the biggest smile i could muster and said im so hungry today the look of disappointment on her face was well worth the i spent on sushi i hope she enjoyed her california roll 
i went into an empty italian restaurant one night the fact that it was empty should have told me everything i needed to know and the place was literally owned and run by a mom and pop no servers he cooked she brought it out she had a terrible attitude was slow never refilled drinks turned the tv on with the volume blasting so they could hear it in the kitchen got mad when i asked her to turn it down a little since i couldnt even have a conversation with my lady etc the food was crap then to top it off she had the nerve to bring out a bill with a tip already factored into the total oh hell naw i crossed out the tip and paid what it should have been and left one penny on the table 
so yesterday my friends and i spent the day at canadas wonderland in toronto there is this one ride called the leviathan which is the newest roller coaster at the park and extremely popular there are trains and when one train takes off another one is done its track so anyways as my train is finished its course we pull up into the station behind the other train however some jarhead with a spraytan is giving the employees a hard time he has an arm cast and is not allowed to ride but will not leave the train because he already went on the ride earlier no matter how many times the workers told him about legalities and the danger they would be in he continued to swear and holler at the workers with little kids around no less at this point the workers eventually begin to pull him and his friend out but not before the guy spat on every open seat on the roller coaster at this point he had held up the ride for about minutes and theres nothing worse than impatient canadian ride warriors best part while he was getting up his phone dropped out of his pocket onto the floor of the coaster nearly tipping off the edge of the train now my buddy and i who were both front seat in our train and front seat in the action yelled at the employee that his phone was right there the worker went and picked it up held it up for everyone to see and he whole queue line just cheered and laughed at this dope the worker even pretended to drop kick the phone out of the station the worker then went to put it in the lost and found and when our spray tanned amigo came storming back for his brand new s every single person acted like they didnt know what happened of course security comes at this point and escorts the two out of the park i highly doubt they had a chance to check the lost and found before they left edit since this is starting to take off i feel i should post the onride from that ride aswell yes thats me on the left
this happened years ago and i just stumbled on this subreddit so i figured i would add a story of mine i used to work at a french bakery where each pasty was in the range this woman came in one night and was being an insufferable b she was being rude complaining about the price making me take each pastry out for her to inspect to make sure it was to her standards i boxed everything up and went to the register she was cents shorti cant remember exactly since it was like yrs ago she told me to just take it from my tip jar since it was such a small amount i looked at her and asked which pastry she wanted me to put back she stared at me and didnt say anything i think she was shocked that i wasnt willing to let it slide she told me to put a croissant back i did she paid i bid her goodnight i couldnt stop smiling the rest of the night 
i took my twoyearold daughter to an indoor inflatable park today padded floors lots of those giant inflatable bouncehouses and slides lots of fun to be had there are two areas one specifically for ages and under and the other for all ages we were pretty overwhelmed by the number of kids at the allages side so we went to the toddler area for some slightly calmer bouncy fun there are only two small bounce houses in the toddler area and when we walked in there were three young women late teensearly twenties laying in one of them taking up nearly half of the bouncing area staring at their phones and generally being in the way being mostly nonconfrontational i stayed my tongue as my daughter bounced around oblivious to the douchery as she played in the unoccupied half of the inflatable then the most glorious thing happened in order to make use of the entire area that was available she decided to just bounce on these inconsiderate bitches she was happily jumping all around them on top of them grabbing their faces for support all those things that toddlers like to do she let them know that they were in her bouncing zone and if they didnt like it fuck it she was bouncing anyway i said nothing only smiled as all three of them moved to the chairs that are available for adults tldr three adults acting like toddlers park themselves in a toddler area used for bouncing get bounced on move
i live in a gated community the kind where some of the residents think that because they live in a gated community theyre entitled to everything last week on the way home from work i was in the left hand turn lane waiting on an suv to turn right so i could complete my turn this lady slowed way way down and took her jolly time making the turn of course oncoming traffic has the right of way so i waited for her to turn in now for the revenge when she got to the gate she stopped and waited for me to get my clicker out to open it for her so i just stopped behind her through her mirrors amp windows i saw her scowl and then pick up her purse and start digging through it as soon as i saw her arm to come up to open the gate i used my remote and opened it for her take that
my gf decided to pick on me during family brunch to make me react instead once we watched a movie together i changed the volume from time to time to odd numbers x x x x when the sound became too loud or too soft so she doesnt get the satisfaction of round and even numbers she complained about the odd number every time i did it take that
in my old workplace we didnt technically have assigned seats but it was an unwritten rule that you stayed in the same place when your job is as mundane as being told to fuck off and die by strangers a day its the little things that get you through yknow so when some fucker comes in and steals my seat like he owns the fucking place and then very cheekily refuses to move this pissed me off theres two types of headsets in a call centre ones with sponge ear pads and ones with fauxleather ear pads he had the latter so while the call centre when on break i stayed behind and took my blue permanent marker and proceeded to colour in the ears of his headset now because of the fauxleather the ink takes a minute to dry especially as id really saturated it on there seatstealing asshole returns from his break and dons his headset unwittingly smurfing himself in the process the beautiful part is that he only found out about his blue ears when he went to the work cafeteria and the server informed him and called for her colleagues to come have a look at the blueear fella this was also doublewhammy revenge i had gotten so much ink on his headset that even after he thought it was clean he ended up with blue ears the next day too tl dr some guy took my seat in work so i gave him blue ears
last night i took my ex girlfriend to the hospital for the fourth time in weeks every time we have missed her appointment because she took so long to get ready she made us late we were fussing on the ride back and i decided i had enough of her bullshit after she pushed my last button i pulled over and told her that she needed to gtfo of my car i hopped out put her groceries and junk food onto the pavement of the driveway i had pulled into and hopped back in she dumped her entire soda on the floor board of my car as she exited trying to be a massive bitch in response i carefully backed up to make sure i would run over the bag filled with snack cakes and chips and yelled for her to go fuck herself as i pulled out and drove off edit because people are confused about our relationship status for some reason
i got married a couple of years ago and we booked a night stay at a great resort in jamaica for our honeymoon we flew out of st louis the day after the wedding change planes in atlanta and then on to jamaica or at least that was what was supposed to happen the beginning for some reason delta airlines was entirely unable to figure out how to get an airplane from st louis to atlanta there were three or four flights that afternoon and every single one of them was delayed all for mechanical reasons by the time we got to atlanta the last flight to jamaica for the day had already left so we had to spend the first night of our honeymoon in a best western instead of the all inclusive resort i had shelled out for the complaint since were on our honeymoon we decide that wed like to sit down and have an actual meal in the airport instead of just grabbing a sandwich so we went to the only actual sitdown restaurant in the unsecured area of the airport it was one of those tgi fridaysapplebees knock offs we get a table and then i actually take a good look at the meal vouchers the airline gave us two vouchers each worth for a total of for the two of us the cheapest thing on the menu at the restaurant was so i was mad instead of being on a tropical beach with my new bride i was stuck in the airport in atlanta and the airline wouldnt even buy us a decent meal so i went back to the ticket counter to complain i wasnt rude i wasnt obnoxious but i was forceful i told the attendant that the vouchers werent even worth enough to buy a plate of nachos and asked him what they could do about it the attendant looked sympathetic and told me he would go talk to his supervisor to see what he could do victory so i waited he was gone for almost minutes i was starting to think that he had either forgotten about me or was avoiding dealing with me when he came back with something in his hand first he gave me two travel vouchers worth each for future delta flights then he handed me a whole stack of meal vouchers of them each worth i thanked the man profusely for his help and returned to the restaurant feeling victorious victory meanwhile my wife had been chatting with the waiter in the restaurant and told him about the delay in our travels and how disappointed she was she had never left the us before so flying to jamaica was a pretty big deal even without the honeymoon i returned we ordered and ate and then gave the vouchers to the waiter to settle the check when he returned he told us that in addition to the food he had gone ahead and put our drinks on the vouchers as well which he wasnt really supposed to do so the entire meal plus drinks was free i gave him a really good tip cash of course not vouchers the revenge so at some point i started reading the vouchers carefully im not a lawyer but i am pretty good at understanding legalese and i made two discoveries first the vouchers expired in three days so if we didnt use them before we took off in the morning we wouldnt be able to use them at all second nowhere on the vouchers did it say nontransferable when we got to the airport in the morning we got ourselves some coffee and muffins after we ate we still had or of the vouchers left so i started handing them out id go up to people ask them if theyd had anything to eat yet today and if they said no i handed them a voucher and told them to go buy breakfast deltas paying if they had kids i gave them i kept at it until i was out of vouchers post script on the way back to the us from jamaica i attempted to use the travel vouchers to upgrade us to first class the woman at the counter had to call the airline office in order to redeem the vouchers but she was unable to get through to them she upgraded us anyway because we had attempted to pay for it and let us keep the vouchers tldr you get a muffin and you get a muffin and you get a muffin edit to the haters yeah after many unhelpful employees i found one guy who actually treated me like a human being i took advantage of his generosity and used of a large corporations immense capital to make several other people happy im a horrible person

this morning i was put on road guard basically i stand at the entrance to the road and prevent cars from running over soldiers conducting physical fitness training this is somewhat problematic because there are a few industrial buildings along this road where civilians have to check in to work during physical training time normally we just redirect the traffic to a safer route today there was a guy who just couldnt listen ol boy pulled up at my intersection and i asked him where he was going fuel farm he says sorry sir youll have to flip a u turn and get there by duncan street actually if you cut through that parking lot back there but i take this road every day sorry sir this is friday not every day and the road is closed to all vehicles youll have to turn around hell no he says im going this way i got a little angry go that way sir and ill call the effing mps military police call the mps then i dont care at this he stomped on his accelerator drove onto the closed road and sped off narrowly avoiding several soldiers now i like to be known as a man of my word since he told me where he worked i drove up there after physical training hours and snapped a pic of his plates i called the mps and theyre on their way to take my statement with any luck at all hell be heavily ticketed and possibly banned from ever driving on fort bliss again update mps took my statement and the statements of a few of the soldiers almost struck and suspended homeboys fort driving clearance he cant drive it on base anymore edit removed insensitive comment that wasnt relevant to the story

so i used to work at a wellknown coffee chain inside a grocery store and we had a new practice put in place if you dont receive a receipt from us you get your money back yeah this is a thing since lots of people just dont want a receipt from a purchase i got into the habit of placing all receipts on the counter customer could take it if they wanted it and if not id toss it so one day this lady comes in orders a medium hot coffee and a coffee roll i ring her up and she immediately starts complaining about the price i tell her sorry coffee rolls cost more than donuts and i dont make the prices i put the change in her hand and the receipt on the counter but make note of the fact that shes reading our little receipt or your money back sign about minutes later im in the way back of the store and my coworker pages me back i come rushing thinking theres a huge line of people but its just that lady from earlier claiming she didnt get a receipt and she wants her refund well i knew for a fact that i laid it on the counter my coworker has already gone through all of our trash bins and couldnt find it on a hunch i went to a nearby trash bin at the stores pharmacy i dig through some papers halfdrank coffees and halfeaten donuts and find the receipt which shed clearly taken and thrown out herself and hold it out for her to take thats not my receipt maam i remember your order you ordered a medium coffee and a coffee roll which i remember because you didnt like the price of the coffee roll we got coffee rolls today plain frosted i know this because ive been here since this morning when i unpacked them myself we now have plain frosted this is your receipt which somehow migrated to the trash on your side of the counter despite your never having received it im sure it was just an oversight have a nice day and i handed her that filthy coffeestained receipt and walked away like a cowboy riding into the sunset tldr woman didnt like our prices tried to get an undeserved refund proved her wrong and handed her her disgusting receipt

when i was in high school i worked part time at hobby lobby in my small texas town we had an egregious amount of madeinchina inventory with a markup of therefore we were always having some ridiculous sell off wool yarn or off wooden picture frames the sale items were usually so unique that the savings didnt amount to a lot and during the week our customer basis consisted of bored coupon hoarding stayathomewives so its a typical saturday and ive got the evening shift the store is jam packed with westendwandas wanting to spend their money on cheap frivolous house decorations and craft supplies im on the cashier when i have the pleasure of checking out this woman whom we shall refer to as cuntasaurus so cuntasaurus starts placing all her disgusting walmartesc decorations down on my conveyor i begin inputting the prices one by one we didnt have scanners as i proceed to bag them she hastily roars i want them all wrapped they neeeeed to be wrapped fine ill wrap your wooden crosses and plastic bird cages no big deal i get these type of cunts in my line all the motherfuckingtime i continue ringing up the rest of her items as i finish she presents me with about stupid coupons for off this and off that no surprise that this impolite beast is a penny pincher she eyes me suspiciously as i apply them one by one i total up her order and politely ask her debit or credit when she practically has a meltdown this cannnnnt be right did you enter all the coupons i dont think you rang up all the coupons maam this is correct i rang up all the coupons cuntasaurus takes a moment of poutyangry silence before i intervene would you like for me to ring them up again yes she whines while practically stomping her feet with frustration this is where the petty revenge comes in you see when i was ringing up her items the first time around i accidentally bagged one of items before ringing it up and out of pure laziness i didnt bother trying to find the item unwrap it and ring it up which would have saved her around but no she had to be a cunt so i rerang everything packed it in the little brown paper just like she specified carefully entered all of her coupons and told her the new amount upon seeing the new much higher total she gave me a confused look and i gleefully announced oh my gosh i guess i originally hadnt included your set of porcelain easter eggs good thing we rerang everything back up her expression fell in an instant and i could see the regret flash across her face hope it was worth the dollars you were trying to save tldr i forgot to ring something up after i bagged it and was too lazy to get it out of the bag to ring it up lady gets cunty about the final price of her transaction saying its too high she insists i didnt properly enter her coupons and makes me rering her entire order the new and correct price is higher thanks to my original laziness i smile as regret flashes across her face upon realizing what just happened edit so many errors 
so about a week ago this car came out of nowhere and cut me off i was pretty annoyed but figured they would speed up in front of me i guess they got upset i was riding their assmaybe secs you just cut me off and hit their brakes causing me to slam on mine i was so angry i actually looked up their personalized license plate and found the owners name through an online forum special car i found out where they worked and considered writing a letter to leave on their car so maybe they would get a little freaked out harmless but i didnt follow through with it fast forward to today and imagine my surprise when i find their car parked in my private lot i couldnt help myself and called the tow truck company to have it towed its a small world dont drive like an asshole especially when you have such a recognizable car
when i lived in college i rented a tiny house behind a larger house they had a large parking area that could fit cars next to the driveway the only way for me to drive back to my house was a shared driveway the front house was occupied by some frat brothers who loved to have people over which was fine except instead of asking people to park on the streetor down the street depending on party size they would park in the driveway blocking my access sometimes id just park in the street and walk back to my house which just stoked my irritation but most annoying was when i would wake up to being blocked in id have to bang on their door for several minutes to get someone to answer and move the offending vehicle typically making me late to class one night i get home late around am and there are three cars in the driveway and i have had enough there was just enough room for me to squeeze into the driveway inches from the back bumper of the last truck this meant i was blocking in those three cars as well as all but one in the parking area and the one that wasnt blocked would have to do some serious maneuvering to get out i took the long walk back to my house planning what snide and ugly thing i might say the next day picturing the next day when theyd be forced to schlep back to my house and ask me to unblock them i intended to take my sweet time answering the door i woke up the next day about pm and no one had come they had maneuvered all those cars around no telling how long it took leaving only my car in the driveway rather than come get me that was even more satisfying to me than if theyd come to get me for the next six months i lived there they never once blocked me in again 
so my apartment complex parking lot is a lawless land where people park in each others spots semi regularly and so every once in a while someone parks in my spot i used to just leave a note that said we pay for this spot please dont park here but im sick and tired of that shit so ive taken to just punishing them by putting random gross stuff on their windshields today almost every single spot in the whole lot was empty besides mine which had a white camry in it and i do not own a white camry i snap call walk back into my apartment and pick up my bottle of pancake syrup and my ashtray and cover that assholes windshield not two hours later im getting back home and i see a woman cleaning the windshield so i just waved and said hello and the woman says hello back then i say hey thats my spot by the way and she gets this ghastly look on her face oh sorry thats fine i turn around and walk into my apartment i like to think she still doesnt know whether i did it or not 
was just reminded of this and thought it belonged here so a while ago im working at the front desk of a hotel its a couple hours before checkin but people check in early all the time if we happen to have a clean room well get you in there if not we get all your info take your luggage and give you a call as soon as your room is ready so on this day we had a convention in convention people generally get in early drop off their luggage go to the convention and grab the keys for their room when the day ends around not this woman shed tried to check in at am got annoyed that her room wasnt ready and then proceeded to check back once or twice an hour each time she asked myself or my coworker would tell her well call you when its ready she comes up again her th or so visit to the front desk says there has to be one clean room by now and at this point i was willing to bend my dont reward bad behavior policy and upgrade her into whatever room was available just to get her out of my face we had oversold the convention rate rooms by a few rooms anyway low floor views blocked by other buildings usually not as quiet because of street noises so we were going to have to upgrade a couple of people anyway so i thought fuck it shes huffing and puffing about how long shes waited and surely there is a clean room by now and i check the computer there is fabulous corner room a bit bigger with massive windows on two side on a high floor with a spectacular view its one of our coveted rooms but its available and ill turn an unhappy guest into a happy one and everyone wins so i tell her actually youre right we do have an available room and before i can finish she throws her purse on the counter my room is ready i have been waiting here for hours why didnt anyone call me you said you would call and i say well yes we did say we would call but but nothing do you know how long i have been waiting i have checked back and you people said you would call but maam let me explain callllllllll you said you would callllll it went like this for a bit me trying to tell her what happened but she would not let me explain she kept chanting you said you would callll over and over now i was pissed that i had even tried to help this woman out i just wanted her to shut up and leave so i pull a trick ive used before maam we did try to call you is your phone number i tell her a number that is one number off of her real number they usually say oh ok simple mistake my real number is i apologize for the mix up buy them a round of drinks at the bar and everyone is happy not this woman yes thats my number i never got a call i was confused did she mishear me so i repeat the wrong number again being sure to emphasize each number so she could see what had not really happened again she claimed loudly that that was her number and this time she said her room should be free because we are idiots who made her wait for hours because we couldnt make a simple phone call my manager is peeking around the corner actually laughing at me and i am now flummoxed she wants free stuff and is not going to back down she called my bluff suddenly it dawns on me maam do you have your phone on you could the ringer be off she said its on is still screaming so i say and the number is right we let me just call it and see what the issue is now her face freezes as she realizes that she just painted herself into a corner i call the fake number and not shockingly her phone doesnt ring as im still on the phone i say sweetly is it ringing its ringing on my end could you check it maybe you have some missed calls she doesnt answer just picks up her purse and asks icily for her room key this is the first time since i told her her room was ready that she hasnt yelled but now im pissed and i am not about to let her have this room instead i find one of the dreaded rooms these are rooms that we never give out unless we are sold out they are right next to the elevator they are tiny they have no desk and they dont even have closets just little armoires theyre being eliminated during the next renovation too so they still have all of the old tvs alarm clocks and outdated bathrooms because no one uses them they are usually clean so i book her into this room smile brightly as i hand her the key and wish her a happy stay postscript of course she called down ten minutes later irate again and i let my manager take the call he told her that if shed like to move she could certainly do that but she would have to wait until after checkin and he would see what we had available then she never bothered calling back 
just discovered this wholly awesome sub and figured this story was worth reposting i had originally told this tale in a comment on another sub a few weeks back when i was i worked at a local video rental place it was privately owned and was bootleg as hell pretty sure the owner used it as a front for something shady but thats neither here nor there the boss was too cheap to pay more than one person per shift so i had the slow wedthurs night shifts all to myself we were in this wiiicked rich yuppy town concord ma and of our business consisted of local soccer moms bringing their kids in for a movie night most of these women were terrible people overlords to their spoiled flock who would throw credit cards around without thinking twice and would condescend everyone they deemed beneath them we had a very basic computer system at the time and there was a builtin function that wouldnt allow someone to rent another movie if they had over of late fees on their account the employees had the ability to overwrite this at their discretion or to lower the fees if they thought it appropriate generally speaking i was the guy who would waive any amp all late fees reason being that my boss was a cheap fuck and i didnt worry at all about making money for him if the customer was nice to me id waive their fees no questions asked anyway one day this woman comes in with a bunch of kids if i remember correctly it was roughly year old boys the kids were running around pulling things off the shelves making lots of noise punching each other pissing off other customers and pissing me off as well the woman didnt do shit about it she sat there gossiping on her cellphone not caring about the scene her kids were causing being a fairly timid amp nonconfrontational person by nature i didnt say anything and just figured id clean up the mess when they left so the woman finally comes up to the counter with like different movies a few video games and a bunch of candy shes standing there on the phone still shoves the stuff at me across the counter and doesnt even acknowledge my presence so i look up her account boom worth of late fees and four titles rented for months and still not returned so i tried getting her attention saying something like excuse me maammaam while her back is turned she gestures me off so i stand there and do nothing waiting she finally hangs up a minute or so later turns to me and says something snarky like well whats taking so long so i explain maam you have a very outstanding fee on your account and i cant let you rent any more movies until this is paid and the missing movies are returned she flips a shit starts ranting that her daughter rents things in her name never returns anything doesnt pay fees and that she herself has done no wrong and the fees should be cleared and she should be able to rent etc etc i nod but say this account still owes and i cant allow you to rent until its paid company policy maam im sorry but i dont make the rules she starts going off again saying ridiculous things like i know the owner hell wipe out the debt in a heartbeat youd better let me rent or ill complain to him about how terrible his employees are and youll be fired etc etc i tell her hes out of the country which was true and cant be reached not true and she still owes getting truer by the second she bitches some more and finally pulls out the card we had this ancient machine that for reasons unknown to me would only read a magnetic strip correctly if you wrapped the card in a plastic grocery bag i couldnt explain to you why but it was the only way the damn thing worked so as you can probably guess i ran the card with no plastic wrap denied tried it again just for looks denied i printed out a receipt and asked if she had cash she didnt and she was ripshit about the card i showed her the receipt saying card not accepted and feigned indifference she asked er violently demanded that she speak to a manager i happily informed her that i was the manager on duty and was indeed the only employee in the store she stormed out and walked across the street to the bank came back a few minutes later with the money and practically threw it at me i took the payment and said now about those overdue movies i dont suppose your daughter would like to return them for you so you can rent these movies i got the worst death glare i think ive ever received and my mother can practically shoot lasers from her eyes and the woman abandoned her stack of movies and stomped out not sure if we ever saw her again but at the time year old me was so proud of myself for staying cool under pressure and fucking with this woman and seriously fuck overpriviledged soccer moms tldr worked at a video rental store got revenge on a rude soccer momrichbitch with outstanding late fees and overdue movies edit broke it into paragraphs for ease of reading

our cafeteria has a few microwaves which is obviously nice when multiple people need to warm something up at the same time but usually there is still a small line of people waiting for the next available microwave while i was waiting my turn for a microwave a classmate comes and ignores the line and tries to take the next microwave before the person in front of me he gets talked down and convinced to wait like everyone else as my turn comes and my food is warming up i notice that the classmate is the next in line and my microwave will be available before the others so having learned of the mute button on the microwave just a few days previously i turned the beeps off as i casually remove my food i sit close enough to see my classmate put his food in the microwave and then pull out his phone while he waits and waits and waits he was so absorbed in his phone that he didnt notice that his microwave had stopped almost minutes ago by the time he noticed and tested his food it was already lukewarm and had to nuke it a little longer i didnt think it would work because i figured he would notice the hum of the microwave stopping even without the beep guess not so a really petty story but it made me smile tldr impatient classmate tries to use microwave has to wait instead gets a mute microwave and his food gets cold 
during college i worked nights at a general convenience store there was a pharmacy toiletries snacks etc basically everything but groceries we also sent out a periodical flyer replete with coupons notifying people of current sales and whatnot an elderly woman used to come in and buy worth of things on sale then come back a week later with those deals now defunct and return them only to claim that she no longer had the receipt without the receipt we have to give her the full price so in short she would spend on sale items then return them at full price a week later to get it was store credit and not cash but still so after a few months i realize what shes doing she comes in to buy her stuff and i even tell her i know what youre doing dont come back a week from now and return these ok so she nods feigns ignorance and buys all of her stuff a week later she comes back in to return everything she doesnt recognize me and i dont say anything this time i ring up each of her items and instead of completing the transaction and swiping a few hundred dollars onto her gift card i cancel the transaction and give her an empty gift card and a receipt with the canceled items on it upon close examination she might have noticed the details and how the transaction was cancelled but she doesnt instead she comes in a few days later complaining about how her gift card doesnt work this time she does recognize me i smile politely and retrieve my manager telling him how this lady is trying to screw us and how i fucked her shit up he laughed his ass off and kicked her out of the store telling her to never come back edit to those of you who dont believe me i couldnt give a shit to those of you who think i did something illegal youre right i committed petty larceny and she committed return fraud to those of you who think i did something morally reprehensible who cares eye of the beholder ultimately she stole hundreds if not thousands from the store and i took back a few of those hundreds i assure you that the store didnt break even and perhaps i should have made this clear from the get go i personally made no profit from any of these transactions

so this was a long time ago im working at spencer gifts americans will know it so im cruzing thru the store adjusting things looking for shop lifters etc i see this woman who was every so often looking around the store as she shopped classic shoplifter tactic so i hide near some tshorts and watch without fail i see her slip items in her purse then she also takes a few other items and keeps them in her hands so i wait till she moves on and go and grab of each thing she pocketed then i head up to the register as i see she is using another classic tactic of buying some things to throw off the store employees who might think she has taken something i tell the person on register that i will take this one first i ring up each of the items i know she has in her purse and put them down on the floor she smiles hands me her stuffi ring them up and give her a total she looks shocked and says that doesnt seem right this stuff shouldnt cost this much i replied oh it doesnt mam i added the cost of the items in your purse smile she looks me in the eyes for maybe seconds then hands me her credit card pays and leaves i wasnt really worried about getting in trouble as the manager loved me hell i was working there for weeks before they had me fill out a application 
i was on a flight last weekend from portland to chicago i do this all the time for work now and usually i am very nice to the people i am seated around i was given the window seat on the right side of the plane about half way in and had two empty seats next to me up until the doors were almost closed at the last moment this douche knocker sits down in the middle seat and throws his shit onto the empty seat next to him he gets asked to place his stuff above and he does but mumbles the whole time doing it well he goes back to sitting down in the middle not on the aisle and bumps my arm off the arm rest i was taken back by that and was like whatever and just sat there looking out the window well as we take off he leans over me and without even asking tries to shut the shade i smack his hand out of my face and tell him in no way is he closing the shade as he is in the middle seat he got mad at that and huffed a little and even pressed the flight attendant button to ask her to shut it she comes by and asks if i would kindly shut it for him and i say nope i want to enjoy my view she says sorry it is my call since i am in the window seat and walks away to help other people i thought that was going to be the end but sadly it never is with these type of people the flight from portland to chicago is roughly hours nonstop and about half way through he has tried to shut the shade another two times as well as adjust my laptop so he can see the show i was watching attack on titan at this point i was done i am normally the quiet type who just explodes in my head and rants here on reddit but not this time this time i was fed up and i wanted to make an ass outta this guy and embarrass him for the rest of the flight i waited until he once again tried to shut the shade it wasnt even that sunny out and the light was only shining on my seat and me i even had to turn the screen down a little to see it clearly but hell i like having the option to look out the window when i want to so he does the reach thing again and this time i pause my show pop out my ear buds and loudly i wasnt screaming but i was using my angry voice i use to yell at my dog when she does something bad and tell the guy that he is being the world biggest douche knocker and who the hell does he think he is to keep invading my personal space when he has an empty seat right to his left in the aisle people around us got really quiet and he got all red in the face a flight attendant came over and asked what was the problem and again in a not screaming but commanding voice i told her about how much of a douche knocker this man was being and he actually got up to excuse himself to the bathroom people were staring at him the whole way and when he finally came back he very awkwardly sat in the aisle seat and wouldnt even look my way the rest of the flight fucking douche knockers edit i suck at spelling sorry edit my nephew has started saying douche knocker lately and he is so i felt like it was a good childish insult 
prologue im a pizza delivery driver end of prologue set up to the revenge i was delivering a pizza and cinnapie to a customer pretty routine i had delivered there once before earlier that week so i already knew where she lived but also that i wasnt going to get a tip which is shitty because of how far she lived i got there and found her sitting on her front porch with two of her friends and her son i took her order out of my trunk and before i even reached her she loudly exclaimed where is my soda i double checked her receipt and said there was no soda on her order just a pizza and cinnapie she didnt believe me until i showed her the receipt she was still giving me hell well i did order a soda i asked how she ordered and she said by phone well i assumed whoever took her order just accidently forgot the soda or just didnt hear it human error it happens at least she wasnt charged for it i told her i could call the restaurant and get this fixed but she straight up told me not to even bother and that she would do it well she got through to the restaurant and explained the situation in the rudest way possible even referring to me as the pizza boy really im well my manager offered her the same offer i did fix the order and have me drive all the way back to the restaurant and back with her mountain dew which she was all for until she heard how long it could potentially take you see i wasnt going to just go back and come right back with a soda no i would have to wait for my next delivery to be ready before i could leave she wasnt having it up until that point she kept on going on and on about how she cant eat pizza with something to drink in my mind i just thought to myself well why not just go and get your own drink and save me my precious time your not going to give me a tip anyway so this would be a big waste of time and gas on my part thats kinda inconsiderate considering this wasnt my mistake i wasnt mad at the person who made the mistake shit happens but she was so rude to me and my manager who is trying her hardest to make this upset customer happy and to no avail and while all of this is going on her son about or was tugging on my pant leg and pulling on the the pizza bag and all three women just stood there and watched him do it lady get your kid off of me and under control wth i thought to myself finally she just gave up and hung up on my manager while she was still talking saying she would just pay for it as is she commented on how stupid the whole situation was and even said that she could probably do a better job that half the people that work there every little thing she said just irritated me and she wasnt even trying to upset me nope she just continued to treat me like i wasnt even there the revenge her order was on a credit card company policy for all drivers is to check the card and a form of id before handing over the order to ensure this isnt identity theft after all that i asked for her card and id she said its her husbands card and hes at work when i heard that it was like opportunity for petty revenge just manifested itself in a physical form it was too perfect im sorry maam but i need to see the card well i cant show you the card my husband is at work well maam im sorry but i cant let you have this order then oh it was a fury unlike anything i had every seen before she was irate she was yelling at me demanding the order i said that if she could get the card i would let her have the food she told me her husband worked about an hour away there was no way for her to do that i told her this was all i could do and she was furious im gonna report you to your supervisor oh you mean the one you hung up on im sure she will take your side im gonna get you fired all my managers love me good luck with that im never ordering from you again good more time spent on reasonable customers i got back to the restaurant with the order explained myself to the manager and he just smiled and gave me a look that said you magnificent bastard tldr customer was upset over a little mistake on her order was rude and inconsiderate to me and one of my managers denied her the order when she couldnt produce a credit card epilogue told that to my gm the next day got a high five end of story

i just came home with a cake it was not the cake i wanted but the cake i needed let me tell you the tale of how this cake came into my possession i head to the local bakery after a day of failed errands to soothe my evening with sweets there was a very large line that people seem to be respecting i get in line to order my goodies the woman behind me was very important you see there were small groups of people waiting to order ahead of her when the frazzled bakery worker asked who was next she blurted out in broken english i next eight inch orange dream cake a few of the people in front of my verbalized that she was not next she starts getting uppity my time more important than you time the bakery worker was a gem she just went right to the person who was actually next the important lady had to wait there was only one of these cakes in the case the impulse struck me i ordered the orange dream cake cue hysterics from important lady she begins swearing and freaking out telling me it is her cake and she needed it this was a rare moment where i performed well under pressure i replied my cake more important than you cake the guy behind her in line started laughing his ass off and praised the outcome so i come home and begin telling my husband and our roommate what had conspired i didnt even finish before he said is there an orange cake in that box yes i brought home orange petty cake
i saw a post earlier about a coffee shop and it reminded me of another bit of petty revenge i had i too worked at a coffee shop in college our shop brought in a whole slew of people many of them college age i always worked the afternoonclosing shift when we got a lot of college students coming in to study there was this one guy who came in often truth be told he never wronged me however the guy was genuinely an asshole the first time i served him he referred to the people out front as faggots i hate that term and was making derogatory comments about women this guy was very conversational and he went on to tell me about how he was training for a triathlon i believed him as he was fit and rode his bike to the store this guy viewed his latte as his treat in the midafternoon after his workout after listening to this guy be a genuine asshole for a few minutes whilst talking about working out and being healthy i went ahead and made him his latte except i made a breve for those who do not know a breve is a latte espresso and milk made with and cream instead of milk a large breve with flavor is about a thousand calories the guy took a sip and loved it im sure theyre amazing he loved it so much he came in often and would always point me out and say that guy he is making my drink he literally thought my way of making the drink was the difference like i had some weird ability little did the derogatory asshole know i was feeding him liquid fat and sugar i hope his triathlon went amazing 
so i parallel park on a busy street next to a farmers market feed the meter and run into a store for a breakfast sandwich when coming back five minutes later a beat up minivan has parked next to my car blocking it in i start out by looking around the van really quick for person to move the van but nobody around im assuming this jack wagon parked with hazards and ran into the farmers market instead of finding real parking like a decent human being just my luck they left their keys in it so i hop in move it back about feet so i can pull out i hop out of van but then the little voice in my head said do something so i reach into the minivan pull out the keys and toss them on the passengers floor up into the corner where they would be hard to see i then pulled out and left enjoying my bacon ham sausage egg and hashbrown breakfast sandwich edit something i forgot to mention it was also my brothers wedding and i was best man so i was in kind of a hurry and nerves were on edge for the day i wasnt putting up with the parking bs 
she stuck a dead bug from the pool into my bikini when i wasnt looking because she loves me
i moved into a new apartment back in may and for the first two months here we had a gentlemans agreement in the parking lot nobody parks in the space next to the mailboxes it makes it a pain to get out of your car and a pain to get to the mailboxes although the spot is extremely convenient two weeks ago this extremely redneck truck started parking there the dude backs in so that he can actually open his door and get out since i walk by there pretty much every day i started randomly folding the passenger side mirror not every day mind you but at least once a week the icing on the cake was definitely walking back from a friends one afternoon and seeing him leave the parking lot and start driving down the road while trying to reach out the window and unfold the mirror keep parking there buddy i can keep this up forever
this is an old one and i was just an observer but i think some of you will still get a kick out of it many years ago i took a coop job on a construction site as an electricians helper there was a guy on another crew who had one of those nail guns that take a small blank pistol cartridge and fire nails into concrete sorry i dont recall the name of it i dont know what his job was but youd see him from time to time looking over a set of prints then hear that thing going off a few minutes later after the first time or two it just became background noise and nobody really paid any attention to it one day while my crew was taking my lunch break we heard that nail gun firing over and over and over normally youd hear one or two shots and then it would be quiet for a while so this was a bit unusual but nothing that anyone bothered to investigate minutes later there was some yelling and a lot of cursing coming from the same general area the nail gun had been during lunch curiosity finally got the better of me and i made an excuse to head over that way i was greeted by the sight of several guys staring at a tool box in the middle of the floor it turns out the guy with the nail gun had gotten into an argument with his boss and was fired he waited until his boss went off site to lunch and came back he found his bosss newish toolbox opened it up took out all the tools and proceeded to permanently fasten it to the concrete floor before carefully putting everything back in the box i have no idea what the fight was about or who was in the wrong but i cant help but be amused by this even decades later 
ok so fall semester last year just starting the final year of my undergrad im in a level computer graphics course the professor is the department chair is a great teacher and is overall a great guy during one of the first lectures he asks the class one question how do you draw a circle without using the sin and cos functions the fact is that trig functions take a computer a pretty long time to do compared to simpler operations the easy answer which uses trig functions is to start with an angle at draw a point at cos x sin x increment the angle by a small amount and stop once the angles at the other students mostly grad students kinda just sat and braved the awkward silence that suggested that nobody actually knew how to do it i thought about it for a bit then raised my hand i explained to the professor that since a circle is the set of all points the same distance from a center you could just use the distance formula with a set radius slowly increment the x calculate the y and draw a point at x y the professor thought about it for maybe half a second then simply stated no thats wrong cue mild embarrassment i was slightly judged by my classmates and professor as somebody who didnt know what he was talking about it was a mild inconvenience but an inconvenience nonetheless and i needed to show him that he was wrong well he happened to assign us a project that included drawing a bunch of circles guess how i drew them i made sure to note the technique i was using i got an a on the assignment he saw my code and realized he was slightly wrong justice served edit i realize that the method i used was not the most efficient way and that there are tons of ways to do it faster edit i love how this has turned into a giant mathematical discussion
one of my students is the biggest jerk ive ever had the misfortune of meeting seriously hes a cancer in my classroom but i cant compromise his education even if he couldnt give two shits about learning i treat him like i would any of my other students i do my job but to get back at him for being such an asshole whenever i hand out notes or quizzestests i make sure to give him the ones that are messed up in some way streaky from the photocopier holepunched in a way so that it doesnt fit properly in a binder stapled improperly you name it those are all set aside just for him theyre not messed up to the point that theyre unusable or anything but just enough that one might find it annoying i dont care that it probably doesnt bother him it gives me satisfaction have a good summer asshat
i am female and this happened years ago when i was about my best friend angie and i lived in a small town growing up it was summer and since we couldnt yet drive we spent most of our days running around town on our bikes our main thing was to get pop from the vending maching in front of the grocery store then go across the street and sit in the gazebo on the courthouse lawn and drink it then we would go to the city park and play on the teeter totters because we were cool like that one day we decided to switch it up and go to the playground of the elementary school in town we were making ourselves sick on the merrygoround when two younger boys maybe showed up on their bikes they started harassing us calling us names and stupid crap like that i couldnt even tell you for sure what they said but surely something beyond forgiveness and we were pissed we said some rude things back and went to play on one of the swingsets they continued yelling rude things to us from across the playground then they threw sand on the merrygoround and peed on it so we couldnt play on it anymore we were steaming they were very proud of themselves then for whatever reason they took their tshirts off it was hot i guess and ran around the playground being little assholes and then i had a plan i whispered it quickly to angie who nervously laughed then we shot across the playground to the merrygoround the boys had wandered off somewhere out of our sight we each picked up a shirt and rubbed it in the sand and pee the boys so generously left for us we were giggling like idiots the whole time hurry angie hissed when we were done and we grabbed our bikes and took off i remember us laughing hysterically the whole way home one of my fondest memories tldr two little assholes peed on our merrygoround and we rubbed their tshirts in it edit tshirts in tdlr not tshorts my bad 
i work in a coffee shop about hours a week while i attend a university i love my job and have been working pretty much the same shifts every semester so far this includes every saturday morning there is a group of older women who come in every single saturday morning at am sharp these women are the most needy rude customers ive ever dealt with every saturday they order the same drink one of them is especially horrible she tells the other workers exactly what scone she wants and if you are new you cant make her drink naturally i always make it because ive been there for years well for two years she has ordered a nonfat late with sugar free vanilla well shes the worst so i give her milk i am drunk with power edit for everyone freaking out i can guarantee you when you walk into a coffee shop and you order a drink the barista will grab whatever milk is already steamed and ready to go even if you specify i have worked in coffee shops all in different states every single barista does it calm yourself new edit okay im sorry for generalising i would also like to clarify that i would never leave milk sitting for more than minutes also i would never give someone caffeine if they asked for decaf i would also never ever give someone dairy who asked for soy thats just not right 
hey guys first off wanted to say i love this sub all the stories are great i have regularly participated in martial arts for the past years started in high school got me through college and now im still at it in the professional world i love every class and would recommend everyone try it at some point regardless of style anyway i digress i would often attend a lunch class held at the school this was a great class because it was smaller so i would get more on help this is where i was driving to at the beginning of my story enter douchbag d i was on a two lane parkway about to exit to the road where my school is located out of nowhere d cuts me off from the left lane to make the exit he almost clipped me as i laid into my horn d shot me the finger and brake checked me pretty bad i had an older car at the time and had to swerve off to avoid hitting him anyway i brushed the incident off and continued to make my way to the class but that is when i saw d in front of me he seemed to be making the same turns i was it wasnt until he pulled into the parking lot and got out that it occurred to me hes in my class and must be new didnt recognize him as i got out of the car a few cars away d gave me the look of you wanna go that was until he saw me completely get out you see before you reach black belt at my school you have a white uniform like the one he was wearing when you reach black belt you may also wear a black one well i was a nd degree at the the time and my uniform was a nicely faded grey a sign i had been there a while d noticed my uniform and the greatest oh shit face descended upon him i just laughed and went past him into the school now i know what youre thinking i kicked his ass right well no i didnt but he did puke from doing bag work with me and i threw him around like a rag doll during sparring the only part of the guy that was hurt during class was his pride and i loved every minute of it
for work i have a parking garage i am assigned to normally most people are pretty good about parking and the spots are a decent size so i dont have a problem i normally get in around right at shift change and usually get a good spot lower level close to the door today i had a meeting so needed to be parked and in much earlier i assumed i would probably have to park higher up because so few people would be leaving when i get in so i pull in the garage fully prepared to start my day in a lessthanideal spot but what is this what do i see is that a spot right near the elevators on the first level glorious morning as i get closer i see why the spot is empty the car next to it is parked over the line making it near impossible for a normal sized car to get ini mean this is a bad parking job jerk i can understand why no one parked next to you almost no car would safely fit but me i drive a subcompact i gracefully swoop in initially aiming to be about equidistant from the cars on either side of me which puts me over my line of parking space as well as i am getting ready to grab my bags my very very petty revenge takes form i pull back out and pull as close to the poorly parked car as i can this takes several minutes to get within inches of the car until it would be near impossible for a human to get in the other cars driver door i realize my car is at risk for having a door banged into it hell my car is a with plenty of battle scars already i doubt this person will muck up their car unless they are as petty as me so im not worried about a new scrape or scratch as i exit my vehicle i see i am well within the lines of my spot it is just that the dick next to me is over his lines enjoy climbing over the passenger seat to get into your vehicle yah inconsiderate jerk tldr parking space reserved for inch waist only
on saturday night i went to a halloween party at a friends place there were familiar faces there as well as a few i hadnt met one of them was a roommate of someone i already knew lets call him jackass we talked a bit during the night and he seemed like a decent guy at this point i should mention that my friend and i had gone as a couple of dead whores nothing too bad i wore a dress but it was loose enough for me to wear shorts underneath as the night progressed he became more drunk at about i claim the only couch in the house that doesnt fold out into a bed there are couches in the house as well as beds a half hour later jackass asks if i mind sharing the couch with him i say sure because i figured that the rest of the couches and beds had been taken over at this point i dont mind sharing just as long as i can get some sleep ten minutes goes by in beautiful silence and then he says hey whore can you give me a back massage i tell him no i want to sleep five minutes later he asks the same and i reply with fuck off i need to sleep apparently he doesnt like this because he grabs my wrist and tries to pull me over to his side of the couch we had our heads on opposite ends of the couch saying dont worry ill repay you ill give you a back massage too i had to kick jackass inner thigh with my heel because he wasnt getting go thankfully that was the end of that for the moment he kept grabbing my ass claiming he was looking for his phone bullshit at this point i was tired pissed and really in need of some space but then he asks me to cuddle with him and tell him no youre drunk and youve already gotten on my last nerve jackass oh thats right youre not into dudes you dyke thats when i lost it im not a lesbian but i do have complete and utter respect for everyones sexual orientation this was just incredibly disrespectful i couldnt stand to be around this guy anymore so i kicked him off the couch to make sure he didnt try forget back on the couch i got a friend to take the other side the next morning just before i was leaving i went back to the couch to make sure i didnt leave anything behind i spot a wallet on the floor and what do you know it belongs to jackass who moved to one of the futons after i kicked him off the couch he was still asleep so i dropped his wallet behind the couch i hope it took forever for him to find it his drivers licence was how i knew the wallet was his and i know for a fact he drove to the party hands off and fuck off asswipe
backstory i had a nightmarish housemate my junior year of college who we shall refer to as nh she was passive aggressive bitchy postit notes all over the house asked other housemates to bring up problems ah had with me so she wouldnt look like the bad guy and seemed to think that because she had moved into the house the year before i was more like a longterm guest than a real housemate nh was a senior and would always leave a mess saying youll understand when you get to senior year there just isnt time to clean up right away but would insist i had to do my dishes the moment id stopped eating we shared a bathroom that was connected to her room but had another door to the outside hall if i did something wrong like forget to turn off the fan after my shower or wash my toothpaste spit out of the sink completely nh would punish me by locking the outside door to the bathroom from the inside then leave for class locking her bedroom door so there was no way i could use the shower i had to keep all my toiletries and toothbrush and towels in my room so i could use the other bathroom which other girls were sharing story towards the end the fall semester i was throwing a dinner party for the people who were going to be in the spring play with me i like to cook curry from scratch which can use a lot of pots and pans and chopping boards id set my chicken in marinade and gone out to get the ingredients for raita i guess nh didnt like the fact that i had set up my clean work station ahead of time because i returned home to find everything gone all the pots pans and chopping boards were missing my guests were set to arrive in minutes and i was now having to macgyver chopping boards out of cardboard and clean paper i found a note that said if you cant take care of my stuff bullshit all of it came with the house then maybe you dont get to use it love nh i managed to make do with borrowing a neighbours pots and pans but was furious when i found out shed hidden all of ours under her bed and locked herself in her room listening to me freak out revenge depending on how many credits youve completed youre given a very strict time slot for registration people who live on campus are forced to use the campus internet which is stupid slow and crashes a lot which forcequits all of your class selection as offcampus people we were safe from that well i was nh wasnt i found out what time her registration slot was then with one minute to go i unplugged the router i heard nh screech then i plugged it back in minutes later i did the same thing and scampered off this time she came stomping out and i heard her smacking the router around we played this game for about ten minutes before i heard her run out the door and start her car presumably driving to campus to register she ended up getting waitlisted for almost every class i regret nothing tldr if you hide shared property ill hide the shared internet edit for spelling its been a long morning
i was getting into the boarding line at dubai airport for a seven hour flight to dublin two lines were merging and all of a sudden some absolute cunt came and roughly pushed in front of me and said that will teach you to bunk in front of someone two times your size i am quite short he was tall and muscular he was the kind of guy who must have been a douche in highschool and carried on that role into his mid thirties anyway i got on the plane and found my seat the bastard was putting his stuff in the overhead locker and setting stuff on his seat behind me we locked eyes and i smiled he broke the contact almost immediately and shuffled to the furthest aisle seat he could it was a packed flight so very quickly a man told him he was in the wrong seat the cunt said fuck sake they are just seats find another the man went to the flight attendant and moved cunty mccuntcunt to his correct seat directly behind me and beside a fat arabic man as soon as the fasten seatbelt sign was off i fully reclined my chair and went to sleep when the meal arrived i ate mine quickly and reclined glad to hear him say for fuck sake i must say i did enjoy my petty revenge and it made me feel much better 
when my mum was a kid money was tight not quite paychecktopaycheck but not far off when my mother was in primary school about or years old she was invited to a birthday party for one of the kids in her year while she was there this perfectprincess richandobnoxious girl from her school who was already on the path to becoming a total bitch decided it was a good idea to inform my mother that the party dress she was wearing was hideously ugly because it had been handmade by my grandmother rather than having been bought from a store like hers she continued to rub my mums nose in her comparative poverty and insult my grandmas work at length before eventually getting bored and deciding to go find someone else to be a bitch to as you can imagine my mother was furious she loved that dress because my grandma had taken the trouble to make it for her and decided she would have her revenge now the girl in question had long blonde ringlets that she was obsessively proud of my mum had been eating a toffee when bitchchild came up to her and as she turned to walk away my mother very quickly and carefully took the toffee out of her mouth and stuck it dead centre in this girls hair the toffee wasnt spotted by anyone for a while by which time it was completely stuck snobgirl ended up having to have that piece of hair cut off which in turn required all her hair to be cut short to match she cried my mother gloated and no one ever knew it was her tldr rich snobby girl makes fun of my mother for having a homemade dress my mother causes her to have all her hair cut off
background so im in my final year at university preparing for end of year exams slightly stressful under any circumstances add in three housemates who are on placement year who come home from work blare music all night and play fifa nonstop and shout at every goal near miss foul throwin you get the picture theyre so loud that the neighbors have complained on multiple occasions but they dont seem to give a shit when theyre off work its time to have fun fuck everyone else i honestly wouldnt mind if it was like a couple of games a night but they play for like a solid hours each night of which almost all is filled with the sounds of screams and shouting im like a week away from starting my final year exams and have asked them to just keep the shouting down as its quite hard to concentrate with people screaming at the top of their lungs every five minutes when i ask i get told yeah sure no problem but within mins it normally starts going downstairs and asking them again is just greeted with huge sighs and making me feel like im the one being inconsiderate to them followed by it starting up again within mins of me going back upstairs petty revenge well i had enough of their shit and unfortunately for them i know my way around a router even worse news for them is that when you are disconnected from an online game it automatically counts as a loss even if you were ahead so recently i have taken enormous pleasure from disconnecting them from games which sound to be extra intense i know the rough length of a fifa match so know the perfect timings to go into the router settings and briefly ban and unban the playstation so they mysteriously disconnect at times i will even go downstairs into the kitchen and do it on my phone so they dont get suspicious and think its me on my computer my crowning moment was when i heard an extra loud roar from downstairs followed shortly by a oh for fucks sake no not again going downstairs i learnt they had come back from being down to be winning it took all my self control to suppress the immense joy and laughter building inside what is even better is it has meant they have been getting so angry at losing their games and receiving bad stats that they have almost given up on playing ahaha tldr housemates give shits im trying to revise for my final year exams and make noise playing fifa all night every night so i have been taking my revenge by secretly disconnecting their online games resulting in them getting bad stats and not playing it anymore out of anger 
i used to work doing training for a software company often i travelled to carry out the training at the customers site once i did this for a company in holland clue their factory is in the shape of a giant egg now when you travel abroad you get a per diem to cover any extra costs if you get your food paid for by the customer you should deduct a certain amount for breakfast lunch or dinner this client made me work through the lunch hour supplying shitty slices of pizza as lunch no choice i refused to deduct that part of my per diem and a week later my boss tells me their manager had gone through our expenses for the training and demanded that they be refunded the part of the per diem they paid for my lunch since they had supplied food they also rang up my hotel and found out that breakfast was included and wanted that back too were talking maybe euros here this was then deducted from my next months salary sooooo a month later they need more training for new people i could easily have flown there but instead said that i had a personal thing and they would have to fly to our hq probably cost them an extra dollars compared to me flying there soooooo satisfying
ive always liked to fish no one else in my family cares for it but i started with a pocket fisherman i got for xmas when i was about i moved up to a larger pole with a closed faced reel and using lures several years later i learned through trial and error how to tie knots cast etc i have an older brother that has always been a dick hes about years older than me and i have many scars from his accidents though the years my family got an invitation to go to a cookout at another familys large farm pond the old farmer that owned the place assured me that there were big bass in the pond and if i waited until just before it got dark fishing would be good about pm everyone had eaten and were done swimming jack the old farmer gave me a big jitterbug lure and acted suitably impressed as he watched me tie it on i went over away from the people and cast along the shoreline near some cattails first cast bam big old bass took the lure and started fighting i yelled out big mistake and started trying to reel it in my yell brought my brother running over and despite telling him to leave me alone he ran to the edge of the water grabbed my line and tried to yank the fish out of the water breaking the line and losing the borrowed lure while he was still bent over and holding the line i hit him with the fishing pole using my long pent up rage it left a lightly bleeding welt across his back which took quite a while to disappear he ran screaming and crying to mom who was furious jack lit his pipe and told my mom id have done it too dont mess with a fisherman he turned and winked at me and i didnt get into anymore trouble

background i oversee an intership program for high school students with learning disabilities one of our job sites is a large grocery store where they bag reshop and front shelves story most of the customers are great with the students they realize that they are teenagers learning a job not the witch she is an older woman with pure white hair and a horrible attitude i first encountered her when one of my students nate was reshopping nate has autism so needs coaching on social interaction witch was standing with her cart in front of the canned goods didnt appear to be looking at the cans i think she was checking her listnate needed to put back a couple cans of peas and her cart was just barely blocking them i whispered to nate to say excuse me and he politely says excuse me i need to put these back she reacted like he had asked her to run a marathon barefoot she snarled at me im standing here he can wait he doesnt need to do this aisle while im in it i apologize and take nate to an aisle as far away as possible now part of nates autism is he has certain routines getting yelled at and breaking his routine threw him off the rest of the day about a month later she is back in the store i try to keep nate in different aisles we are finishing up the soup section when i see her come down the aisle nate only has one can left but of course she parks her cart and walks in front of the one section he is working on she again looks at me not acknowledging him and says im going to be shopping here gestures at entire section of shelf i calmly say he just has the one can to put back it goes right there and point to the spot in the upper left of the shelf a good feet from her she rudely barks out he can do it later im looking at this section by this time he is standing right where it needs to go she can still see the entire shelf i nod to him to put it back he does and we go to another aisle without making eye contact with her nate looks a little upset she was mean again a few weeks later she is back luckily my students are bagging on the front end so they avoid her its about minutes until my students bus comes when she gets in que i wait until she is next in line then go up and tell my student who is working there that she can stop when she is done with the current order i then pull the other three students off of there lines about minutes earlier than usual as my students waited for their bus i got to watch her bag half her own groceries the replacement bagger got there just as she finished
background my office is on a quiet street with a painted yellow curb out front when i say quiet street i mean its half a standard city block with a dead end so we dont get a lot of traffic our parkades are all over the place so when someone forgets something at the office rather than reparking in a parkade they park their car out front for a few minutes to run in and grab whatever it was this usually isnt a big deal quiet street remember but the bylaw officers disagree and many of my coworkers have been ticketed for illegal parking at a yellow curb the setup one day i left for lunch and saw a city parking enforcement car parked smack in the middle of the yellow curb it was actually blocking the wheelchair dip shame i couldnt see the bylaw officer around you know ticketing cars or something so i took a picture of the car and went out for lunch when i came back an hour later the car was still illegally parked and again no bylaw officer to be found took another picture of the car and continued into my building i have no idea where that person was but i can guarantee you they were not doling out parking tickets were blocks away from a major metered shopping street with plenty of legal and much more convenient places to park i suspect they were off eating lunch or something the revenge since i love a little schadenfreude after lunch with a healthy side of petty revenge i get back to my desk and email the citys parking enforcement department i detail that one of their officers has parked illegally for over an hour and this sets a poor example when so many of us have been ticketed yeah i laid it on thick i included all said pictures of course the result a week later i heard back from parking enforcement they confirmed that the bylaw officer had indeed parked illegally and explained that illegal parking is allowed if the bylaw officer was in the midst of their duties since the officer apparently wasnt in the midst of their duties the office also confirmed that they had been reprimanded for their actions they also apologized bonus that was years ago havent seen parking enforcement around since peace was thus restored to the land tldr parking enforcement officer parks illegally gets reprimanded hasnt been seen since
i used to manage a convenience store and we hired this woman lets call her evil whore or ew for short ew looked good on paper but she was not a nice person ew worked mornings with a lady i will call ann anns son john worked afternoons with me one day john told his mom something rather surprising and his mom shocked confided in ew by the end of the week ew had outed john to the rest of the staff and embellished how ann found out to include her walking in on john and another guy fortunately the staff loved john and rallied around him but what a nasty thing to do in addition to being a bitch ew was also an alcoholic one time she brought her sixyearold son to work where he spent the balance of the day whining that he wanted a lemon drop finally a coworker a sweet girl who liked to make people happy bought a bag of lemon drops for the kid who informed her that she must be stupid because a lemon drop is vodka lemon juice and sugar anyway although things started out alright eventually it got to the point where if we scheduled ew to work on a monday morning she failed to show up a full of the time it had been about months since we hired her which coincidentally was how long she needed to work before being eligible for unemployment benefits again when we stopped scheduling her for the shift on mondays we gave her the instead which obviously resulted in her losing some hours ew did not like that it was about at night and i was at home when my phone rang it was ew drunk and yelling at me about her hours she called me a stupid bitch a few times and kept repeating a simple mantra fire me fire me fire me so i eventually hung up and i called my boss and told her what had happened we talked a bit and decided ew was more trouble than she was worth so i called her back and said ive thought it over ew and i have decided to take your advice and fire you goodbye but that isnt the revenge bit the revenge is when she filed for unemployment i know a bit about how bureaucrats work so i decided she wouldnt be getting unemployment benefits this time around we contested her claim and gave the unemployment office my contact information when they called they asked me why i had let her go it went something like this unemployment guy ew says you cut her hours can you explain why that happened me well ew does a good job when shes there but unfortunately i think he has an alcohol problem she hasnt been dependable on monday mornings so we decided to let her sleep in ug but she was a good employee other than that me yes and no shes good at the work but she outed a gay coworker to the whole company last month and the last straw was when she called me at home and started swearing at me she called me a bitch while i was in my own home i dont have to put up with that i was in my living room and shes yelling at me saying fire me you stupid bitch and i am not going to be called a bitch in my own home ug wait she asked you to fire her me yeah while calling me a bitch in my own home no less ug but she said the words fire me me over and over again but i seriously dont need to be called a bitch in my own home ug but she asked to be fired okay i think youve answered my questions thank you i hung up with a huge grin on my face it was a week or two before the letter from unemployment came ew was denied and would have to get a job boo fucking hoo tldr pickled bitch has to get a job edited to break up the wall of text and typos
ive had to live next to these two dickheads and their awful children since when they moved into the ugly mansion towards the end of the street thats so big it borders two units close to the local park since the start theyve been so rude obnoxious loud and aggressive i have to listen to the parents screaming at the children because the two children were screaming homophobic slurs at each other or being uncooperative no wonder they try to pickle their livers every night anyway since day the brats have been chucking various balls over the fence like footballs aussie rules style soccer balls rugby balls tennis balls cricket balls i kept joking about giving the shit to charity and now im doing it for real a red sherrin just smacked into the window and nearly broke it so im taking it to work with me at the op shop and it can be resold or donated to a local primary school for the sports shed i rushed out to get the ball and bring it inside now its in a big garbage bag and i cant stop laughing like a cartoon villain
the door to my room doesnt close all the way cause the door hinge broke during one of our parties this has tempted my roommate to try and catch me during my happy time hell quietly walk into the house after work or school creep up the steps and jump in screaming i gotcha luckily im under the covers so he doesnt see anything but its still pretty annoying he has succeeded times in the past months and yesterday i figured enough is enough i get everything ready and timed his arrival from work i saw him pull in and i run to my room and get into position i dont hear a thing which is normal so i know what hes gonna do the poor bastard barges in screaming gotcha bitch to his surprise catches me masterbating without the cover with a shit ton of lotion on my hand and penis i make eye contact with him the whole time and continue to masterbate staring into his soul he immediately yells wtf in his sort of crouching surprise stance and freezes for a second then immediately runs out into the hallway yelling thats fucking disgusting man he went into his room and i didnt see him till this morning when i did all i said was it is i who got you bitch and continue to eat my pop tarts
does it count as petty revenge if the target didnt specifically do anything to me personally a few years ago i went back to school to get another ba because the first time around my gpa could be charitably called aggressively mediocre and i really wanted to go to grad school my wife had a full time job at the time so i didnt need to get a part time job or anything but i get bored easily i applied for a campus security job because it fit my schedule and wasnt particularly demanding work it was a pretty easy gig involving mostly sitting around in the lobbies of various dorms on weekends and checking ids of incoming individuals to make sure everyone coming into the dorms was a resident or guest it was part of the campus safety initiative most of the time i just sat there and studied since most of the excitement was just after last callthis is in canada so its pretty normal for freshmen to be legal drinking age occasionally i was asked to patrol around campus and ticket cars that were improperly parked i didnt mind the walking but ticketing students never sat well with mewho has money for that shitso this was not my favorite part of the job as an aside i tended to not give out tickets unless the person parking was actually blocking something important or their parking job caused a hazard fuck the man anyway one day in the late fallstill above freezing but not by muchi was outside the engineering building and i saw a newish bmw seriesor maybe it was an m i dont recall so im just going to say it was an m for brevityparked in the handicap spot and it did not have handicapped tags as usual i approach the car slowly like im sneaking up on it i discovered that people who are about to get a ticket tend towards the loud and aggressive ive found that no one actually likes the meter nazi and a loud blustery car owner tends to attract an unsympathetic crowd its better to sneak up on the car confirm that it is in fact illegally parked or has an expired pass walk away write the ticket and then casually return and slip the ticket under the wiper gtbe me meter nazi gtuse stealthy ticket gtit is very effective i wrote out the ticket stuck it under the wiper and walked off i did another walk around the rear parking lot and then because it was near the end of my shift i returned to that same building because there was a tims inside and i wanted to grab lunch and a coffee i go inside get my coffee and sandwich then go back outside to have a smoke im standing by the smoking dont actually know what these things are calleddrink in one hand sandwich tucked in my jacket pocket smoke in the other hand and just zone out next thing i know theres some guy in my line of sight swearing loudly i zone back in and realize it must be the owner of the m hes this skinny dude wearing a puffy and hes got fancy hair i figure hes probably or tops hes got the yellow envelope in one hand and hes all fucking shit fuck fuck dick cunt shit fuck motherfucker etc while hes swearing and having a bit of a spaz hes also looking around presumably to see if the meter nazi is still around so he can give him a piece of his mind oh wait im the meter nazi and im like feet away still smoking sandwich in my pocket coffee in the other hand parking ticket printer slung across my chest well shit gtbe me gtbe at the end of your shift gtexpect to be yelled at by puffy vest fancy hair i steel myself for the eventual tirade policy is we have to be all beta about confrontations our interactions should consist of yes sirmaam no sirmaam i understand sirmaam but overall being firm about why they received a ticket he swings his vision around several times but doesnt seem to spot me im not wearing anything distinct other than the mandatory blue campus security jacket and a ticket printer he keeps looking around left right left right i take another drag for whatever reason he doesnt see me he angrily throws the ticket and yellow envelope into his car bleeps the car with his remote and heads back into the building so im still standing by the smoking sandwich in my pocket halffull medium doubledoublethe old medium not the new upsized mediumwith one drag left on my smoke so i finish my smoke feed the pawn and sit down at the nearby bench to have my sandwich im sitting on the bench eating my sandwich drinking my coffee and staring at this m that is still parked in the handicap space im gonna finish my sandwich drink my doubledouble have another smoke and then im going to give him another ticket says i to myself its a trap replies my brain making a very good point i dunno man this is too good of an opportunity to pass up im just saying how could it be a trap what he has a gang of puffy vested bros in there just waiting to challenge me to a dance do whatever you want just no concussions my brain made a valid point this would be an excellent trap i pop the last of my sandwich into my mouth wash it down with my now lukewarm doubledouble and light up another smokedu maurier light kings with the droopy cigarette impotence warning no doubtand stare at the entrance to the engineering building no sign of puffy vest fancy hair with one hand i start typing out the ticket on the printer but dont press the print button yetif i hit the button it saves the data and theres no way to undo it once that happens i wasnt yet ready to commit to this course of action i finish my second cigarette pull out a yellow envelope take a breath and hit print as i start walking toward the car the thermal printer quickly spits out the ticket and i quickly insert the ticket into the envelope and sling it under the wiper nothing happens no ambush no screaming no puffy vest fancy hair all that buildup for nothing i check my phoneif i recall correctly it was a motorola flip phone of some varietyand shift ended a few minutes ago im not technically in any hurry to get back to the office we have lots of ticket printers for the next shift so im not preventing anyone from starting their shift by dillydallying i use the camera phonewith a whopping x resolutionto take a photo of the ticket sitting on his passenger seat and a photo of the ticket under his wiper then i walk into the engineering building get another coffee and plant myself back in the designated smoking area and i hope that this kid isnt in a three hour class im now here for a show im going to get yelled at itll be a huge scene ill have to be all professional about it but seeing puffy vest fancy hair have another spaz is totally worth it youre an idiot says my brain i let my coffee cool just for a bit before i take a swig of course i forgot to check where the paper cup seam was and dribbled coffee down my chin son of a bitch i put my coffee down and awkwardly wipe the coffee dribble from my chin just as i hear another stream of cunt fuck motherfucker what the fucking fuck erupts from the vicinity of the m who the fuck did this what the fuck theres puffy vest fancy hair sack of fast food in one hand jumbo fountain drink in the otherah to have the metabolism of a yearold againhes whirling around trying to find the meter nazi again while swearing up a storm hes now making enough of a scene that people are actually staring at him as they walk by for some reason he still hasnt spotted me im standing a mere feet from where he is spazzing i am right beside the smoking pawn wearing a blue jacket that says campus security on it i have a printer slung over my shoulder and across my chest for some reason his gaze never lingers on me at all after a few more seconds of spazzing he gets in his car throws the other ticket onto his seat and speeds away why he didnt see me is inexplicable the only hypothesis i have is that he was expecting the parking enforcement officer to be wearing something else maybe a high visibility or maybe something like i dunno i dont recall how much those tickets run a few hundred i think but that kid had one expensive day my boss did tell me that the kids father called in pretty pissed about the tickets i had emailed my boss the camera phone photos that afternoon because i figured hed probably ask my why i wrote two tickets to the same guy on the same day my boss explained to the kids father that because campus security had witnessed the driver return to his vehicle remove the ticket and leave it counted as a separate parking incident thus two tickets were warranted tldr guy in puffy vest gets a double shot of karma for parking in handicap zone
disclaimer i posted this as a comment to someone elses post and it was suggested to make it a new post here you go people parking in my private parking space used to happen to me all the time at an apartment complex i lived in heres a pic for reference my spot was the second spot on the left side of the lot where that red car is next to the empty space on the right end the right end space was a coworker which plays into the story my spot even had a sign that said resident parking only all others towed except the manager never towed any cars even though i asked her multiple times but she was nice to me so that was good at the time i drove a chevy c pickup long bed which was a really big truck it looked pretty much like this but primer gray because broke college student fuck you very much and i was an idiot and why did i drive that there was no guest parking and there was never enough space for me to park on the street as it was always packed and my truck really didnt fit into normal spaces anyway id have to park a mile away or start yelling for whoever it was to move their car so yeah at least once a week you could find me standing out in the parking lot yelling at the top of my lungs about some asshole and their car and move it and i am sure people laughed at my weekly meltdown and sometimes nobody would come out to claim their car of course this always happened when i had come home from school and had to get changed to go to work i didnt have time for this one night i got home from work and someone was in my spot i was tired of this shit so i simply parked my truck directly behind the asshole in my space and my coworker see yellow highlighted area in first pic my coworker was also home so the asshole could not get out going forward was a drop and while i dreamed about pushing cars off the edge i never did about an hour yes an hour later someone comes knocking on my door i did not open and asked what they wanted they said i was blocking them in i was pissed that someone told them where i lived and i told them they were in my spot and there was a sign and they fucked up and to go away a few minutes later they came back and i was even more mad and yelled at them and told them i would be gone tomorrow morning at am and they could get their car then and to go the fuck away my coworker didnt mind as i checked with them beforehand and she just said she could just pull forward to get out of her space if she needed to she said she decided to leave her car there though because it was awesome they left defeated i was worried id get towed but nothing happened this happened again a few times with the exact same outcome no one knocked on my door though after about two weeks all the other residents started doing the same thing youd hear people yelling dont park there youll get blocked in when their friends would come over after a month it never happened again success edit clarification edit my follow up post with video 
in my junior year at college i had two or three incidents of being woken up in the middle of the night by phone calls from the same drunken student every dorm had a digit phone extension and i assume when he was drunk he would consistently misdial or incorrectly remember someones number and enter mine instead i would answer he would be almost totally incoherent i would hang up and go back to sleep the way the phone system worked at the college there was no caller id from intradorm calls within the system unless it went to voicemail and the person left a message in that case it would actually tell you what digit extension the call came from so the last time it happened i let it go to voicemail and he was drunk enough to leave a babbling message i recorded the extension on a post it on my desk for the remainder of that semester probably months i made it a point to dial this extension at am every monday and thursday because i had to be up extra early those days for an insectbreeding research project i was doing id wait for him to pick up to make sure id woken him and then hang up and continue with getting showered and dressed
