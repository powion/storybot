not me, but a guy i worked with 10 years ago. i guess it counts as a revenge. i worked with a guy who really stuck it to his ex wife. when i met him he was working in a sporting goods store making 8 dollars an hour. he was not really like the other retail monkeys. he was older, well groomed, well spoken, clearly educated etc. one night after work he gets into his car, and i couldn't help but notice that it was a very very nice newish jaguar. i asked him how he could afford it and he explained it to me: he had been an svp at a well known fortune 50 company (which i will not mention the name of!), pulling in 300k with bonuses and stock options. he was married but the marriage fell apart and in the divorce, she demanded that she get the house and 40% of his wages. he and his lawyer somehow managed to get her to agree to let him keep the house in exchange for 75% of his pay..no dollar figure or employer specified lol. as soon as she took the settlement he quit his job and looked for a minimum wage job. he said to me that "she gets 75% of nearly nothing now". he had other money stashed away, so he didn't even need the job and he had the house and it's equity as well. also, no kids, so there was no child support. just alimony. she was furious of course, and tried to re-sue him but failed at least once and when she claimed that the settlement was not keeping her in the life style she was accustomed to, he simply told the judge that the divorce was traumatic to him and he could no longer do his old job as a result. at least at that time, she did not manage to get out of the deal. not sure how it all ended. but i thought it was fucking brilliant if not crazy-level spiteful. he was a good employee too...good with customers, showed up on time, no bullshit absenteeism or anything like that. he claimed he loved each payday because it reminded him how little she was getting. this story begins almost a year ago. i received a call from an unknown number on my cell phone. it was an automated message to call a 888 number in regards to serving me papers. i knew right away this may have been a collection agency. googled the number and confirmed it. now i have to disclose i did have identity theft almost 20 years ago. to this day i occasionally get calls from collection agencies trying to collect on some debt from 20+ years ago that was cleared. now most of the time when i get these calls, i ask for their address to send in a dispute letter including the accompanying data for proof that i had identity theft. granted they should not be calling me, but they apologize and i don't get another call. plus they usually mail me back and said they closed the account. well, i go to call this person and i got to say the call was interesting. this woman answered and i gave her my information. she started rattling off a debt that was back in 1995. i let her finish and i told her that i had no knowledge and there was identity theft. and as soon as i said that, she freaked out. she kept saying she knew the debt was mine and i'm going to pay. i kept telling her that i wanted to mail a letter. but she flat out refused. when i told her i knew my rights, she said that i had the right to pay the debt. she then said that she is going to put a lien on my "huge pretty house" (her words) and she was describing the house to the letter. she also said she is going to put a lien on my lexus that she "sees" in the drive way. and she said that my gate in the front won't stop the repossession. she then hung up. now i knew better. all she did was get my info from public records and then saw my house on google street view. my guess is that she tried to push this intimidation on other people that know better. so far it appeared to be a very disreputable company. i also had phone recordings when i called in. and they were legal as i asked her if phone calls can be recorded for quality control purposes. she said of course. and i said "thank you, i'll take that as my consent". i would of just let this go and just say this lady was crazy. but i kept getting the automated phone calls and i couldn't block them as they were unknown. i googled the company and i thought they were in ohio. a couple of flags that led me to believe this was that the person who owned this company in ohio was being indicted with charges whom was an attorney. i placed a complaint with the ohio attorney general. they couldn't find any information on what i was submitting. they did call the phone number i gave them and the attorney general told me they would stop from calling me. but that is all the attorney general could do. i also complained to the federal consumer finance bureau whom is supposed to be looking into these issues. but they blew my off. well three months later, i called this number. i had an idea of maybe pressing buttons when i called in to see if i could get more information about the company through the ivr. well that paid off. as soon as i pressed 0, i got a different company name. i googled that company and got tons of complaints. this lead me to the company existing in ny. i complained to the attorney general of ny with all of my info. i done quite a bit of research over the next couple of weeks and found out a whole bunch of information such as the owner . found out that the address where the company no longer received mail was at the owner's address, their facebook account, etc.. i then got another one of those unknown phone calls. but this time, it's a different company. i'm sure you get what i am getting at. the company just keeps changing the name, but the parent company still calls. i finally had enough of this. i get a private investigator involved and they were quite satisfied with all the information i got so far. so i let him do his business. well he calls me back saying that this company isn't even registered and it's ran by this one lady. i find out the rude lady whom i am talking to is the supposed owner, but not running a legitimate business. i got a process server to file a claim in ny. granted i think i could have done it where i was at. but i was heading up to that area in ny anyway as i had some family reasonably close. problem was she was not able to be served. the house which she owned, she was not able to be served at. either she was not there or was staying somewhere else. well my private investigator started sending out friend requests to her and the people in her friends lists. well her friends and then she accepted the facebook request. my private investigator found out that she cheated on her boyfriend about a month ago since she posted that crap. the private investigator gave me an idea of trying to reach her boyfriend and if he can lead us to serve her, i will give him $500. well we did that and sure enough we were finally able to serve this lady at her parents house about 20 miles from where she was at. i fly up to ny and since it's small claims it's just me and this lady. for some reason her mother is there too, but she is not representing. i give the judge all of my info i had over the months and how she broke the law. she broke debt collection laws and threats over the phone. after the judge heard all the trouble i had with these calls and how she hid her identity purposely, the judge gave me the maximum amount of $3000. in ny, small towns and villages are limited to $3000. after the case, i heard her mother loudly whispering (but i heard it,) "you better hope he doesn't take your house" "your great grand-father built this with his own bare hands" i was thinking. "hmmm, it would be sweet revenge if i could actually put a lien on the house" well lo and behold, i found out the house had a second mortgage attached to it. with the property value of the house and if it sold, i wouldn't end up getting the lien money since the secondary mortgage was almost as much as the house. i was then contemplating how i was going to get the money from this lady. my private investigator calls me five months later and said her house is going into foreclosure. i get a proxy to bid for me. but as in most foreclosure actions, the bank buys it back as an reo. i decided to send in a low ball offer to buy the house a couple of months later. the bank accepted my offer. my guess is that it's a small town and trying to get the right market was an issue. you may be wondering why i even bought this house? well here's why. this bitch threatened to put a lien on my house with no merit. well guess what, i fucking took her house! it was completely worth it. it didn't cost me too much and i had the money. the house is actually in decent shape, just a little small. plus it will be a nice summer home when i go to visit my relatives. oh and i decided to rub in salt to the wound. i sent a letter to her parent's address letting them know i took the house. i told them that if her daughter wouldn't be in the business of scamming people, they may not have lost the house. i also go to find out that the attorney general of ny is now investigating this lady. i hope they throw the book at her! not going to mention the collection agency, but if you stopped getting phone calls from them, you're welcome! edit: fixed some minor grammar since a couple of people were harping on me. happy? update: i'm surprised this post got so much attention. first of all, for the people who gave gold. thank you! i know that some people are calling bull shit to my story. all i can say is that this is 100% true. i tried to give as much detail as possible. i just want to address all the people giving me a hard time over the grammar. i didn't intend this to be a newspaper article. everything was typed out free form as i wanted to get the entire story out there. i apologize if that really detracted you from enjoying the story.apparently other people did enjoy it. i considered going through and re-writing for the grammar mistakes. however, i am sure these same people would find something else to be negative about. having said that, i do not have any ill feelings towards the negative people or the skeptics. this is the internet and my feelings aren't hurt. i love you people as much as the people who enjoyed the article. i wish i could say this is my story, but it's not. this one is courtesy one of my closest friends. for reference i'll be referring to him as "bp". slightly not safe for work, i suppose...i'd rather tag it and it not be, than not tag it and have someone's boss walk up and read it :d also, names and tiny details are changed or omitted, but the overall story is legit. a few years ago, bp was dating this girl. he really dug her and did everything he could to please her. he was a reasonably funny dude, not bad looking,and he sung for a band, so he had his choice of a few ladies, but chose this one because he was really fond of her. bent over backwards for her, so to speak. after the relationship goes on for awhile, he finds out she's been cheating on him. and it didn't just start, she's been cheating on him since they were courting. apparently, his love for her wasn't mutual, and she just refused to give up other guys, even after their own relationship seemed to get serious. bp was furious, but he wasn't the type to shit in her cereal, beat up the other guys, etc. but he wanted to get back at her somehow, some way. a few days later, we're all out drinking, hanging out, hitting the bar circuit, having a good time when who else but his ex's mom actually shows up. ex's mom gets liquored up with us when bp actually saw his opportunity for revenge. so he sweet talks the mother to the point where she ends up bringing him back home with her, and then...you guessed it. he had sex with his ex's mother. but the story gets better. post-coitus, he decides to get up and go to the kitchen to get a drink. not putting anything on but a t-shirt, he walks into the kitchen and opens the fridge. at this point, his ex, who was out herself, comes in and runs into him, naked from the torso down, in her fridge. she screams at him, "what the fuck are you doing here?" nonchalantly, he replies, "getting some orange juice." **tl;dr, good friend's long term girlfriend cheats on him, gets revenge by sleeping with her mom, gets caught in the kitchen by his ex and says "getting some orange juice."** edit: holy crap, front page! thanks, guys! edit 2 (5/7/13) somehow, this made "best of", so this post made front page twice. since today is my birthday, i find it an amusing present in a weird sort of way. however, i do wish whoever posted it to bestof had clarified the title a little bit- seems people think i'm delivering about the safe. i don't know anything about the safe beyond what you guys know... and i imagine, if that op finally delivers, it'll stay on the front page for awhile...the year was 2008 and i was 9 years into operating a landscape company. i had done moderately well for myself being able to purchase a home, pay off student loans and start a family. i employed 4 people during the what i call work season, which for us is march through november. december through february we lay off our workers and go on hiatus for the most part. side note, our company focused mainly on maintenance, and in the pacific north west once all the leafs are picked up from the autumn there really isn't much maintenance to be done. i had that year developed a relationship with a home builder who hired me to care for his personal home and very much liked our work. he asked us to start bidding on installing the landscapes to the homes he built. sounds easy right? well remember, we focused mainly on maintenance so my crew didn't have a ton of experience in the install detail of landscape, and, the homes this guy built were not "track homes" or your cookie cutter type neighbors you find in the suburbs. no, a small home for him was 3500 sq ft on a 25k sq ft lot, and an average size he developed was 8500 to 10k sq ft home with all the bells and whistles. he was more generous in his landscape budgets than many of the contractors i'd met and we were off to what i had hoped would be great partnership. we finished the first 4 projects he handed us and it was now the beginning of december when my maintenance side of things drops off. this home builder came to me and asked if i would like to keep my maintenance crew working for the winter working for him. i knew his next home project wasn't set to break ground till late january so i asked what he had in mind. he told me that he and his son had been experimenting with spray foam insulation in their homes and had decided to invest into purchasing equipment to start there own company. to purchase the equipment on this level was about 100k. i said i would talk to the crew and get back to him. the next week we signed a contract to work with him for three months at a specified pay rate for five of us. he was confident he had enough work to keep us busy for the next three months. first job was insulating this incredible house for this plastic surgeon who spared no expense for the gadgets and material that he put into his home. next was government buildings on fort lewis. next was new apartment complexes. etc etc.. now, this builder who i was friends with was not my day to day boss while insulating, it was his son, who is younger than i and a bit of a jerk. but we got along fine and all seemed well. the father owned the insulation company, but had very little to do with it on a day to day basis. hardly saw him for three months. now, being a contractor myself i was used to not getting paychecks every two weeks like most working folks. i would get paid once a month from my maintenance accounts for the previous month of service and it didn't all come in at once. " sometimes people forget to pay on time ". my crew though was used to getting paid in a timely manner. and after the first month of work and receiving no check from my new boss i inquired when to expect a check. he assured me that once the checks started rolling in that we would see our money- i totally get how that works, especially for a new company trying to get off the ground. so i paid my guys to keep the peace on my end and my boss and i worked out an agreement that i would keep track of everything paid and that he would cut me a check once he was able to. i also had an outstanding landscape invoice out with the father of over 10k that i wasn't really worried about because he was not always super quick about payment- not that i had to hound him about it, but you understand. now we are at the end of february of 2009 and it was time to gear up for the new season of landscape maintenance and put my crew back to work outside. still no payment from insulation or last landscape project. things got ugly real fast as i started daily phone calls to the son now that we didn't see each other as often. i called the father who more or less ignored me. the son stopped answering my calls/texts etc. the father never had a straight answer for me. now mid april of 2009. most communication has stopped on their end. i filed a contractors lien on the landscape project to be paid out before the house sold. which prompted a call from the father to invite me to his home for lunch and talk. i accepted thinking he was going to offer me a deal of some kind, based on my past history with him. he basically told me that he had been over the years screwed out of money by different people and that it was something that i was going to have to learn to live with. my response " i've been screwed out of money that people owe me as well, just not by anyone i considered a friend". i left his house determined to stick it to him. may 5 2009 i started a spray foam insulation company with the same level of equipment that he had but about a year less experience than he had. may 7th i get a call from the father asking a landscape question ( acting as if we were on normal terms ). my response was " oh, i don't landscape anymore, i spray foam". what are you talking about? he asked. when i explained to him that i was operating a spray foam insulation company he ended the phone call rather quickly. i then receive a phone call from his son 5 min later ( who had ignored my calls for the last many weeks ) threatening me that he would destroy my hopes of making it as an insulator and that no "little landscaper" could/would make it in this community. side note, with my newly formed company there was now approximately 4-5 companies in the pacific north west performing this kind of service. it is a small circle of people in the insulation world and the word gets around pretty quick who does what etc. our very first job was handed to us by our material supplier which happened to be "his" supplier and that job was a "fix". apparently that very first job we had worked on ( that plastic surgeons house ) was insulated incorrectly and poor workmanship. luckily my only involvement on that house was prep work and clean up. we ended up removing all of the insulation and re-installing it. about a 65k job which the owner of the house turned around and sued my old boss for and won. we then acquired the government contract at fort lewis that he had because of poor communication on his part. anyway, we systematically took apart his company by being better and honest with people. the story spread ( in the spray foam insulation world ) and we became somewhat hero like in this region because they had screwed so many people over. oh, and at that time if you might remember, the housing market took a giant dump and guess who had 4 very large houses sitting out there that couldn't sell. yep the father, who ended up going bankrupt by mid 09. the son on the other hand kept his head above water somehow a bit longer. but in oct of 09 i got a call from a repo man asking if i new the " son " and where to find his spray foam equipment. my father in law happen to be an retired cop and pi and i put him on the case to find said equipment. two days later he called with the address and specific location of the equipment which was behind a barn on an island with the tires aired down. i made the call to the repo man and two hours later he called me from his lot as he was pulling in with a very large trailer behind his truck asking where he could send the bounty check. i kept the insulation business for about 3 years before being bought out by another company. i also kept the landscape company and still run it to this day. moral to the story, landscapers may work in the dirt and seem simple, but piss one off and they will ruin you. our lovely hoa has decided that should you choose to decorate your exterior for the winter holiday season, your lighting may not have 2 consecutive bulbs that are the same color, unless all of your lights are the same color. last year, i hung my usual blue lighting and intentionally swapped in one red bulb, just to piss off our hoa cc&amp;r enforcement "officer." it took 2 days before i had a friendly phone call, another 3 days until i received a certified letter, and an additional 5 days until a $50 violation fine showed up. the holidays passed, and i continued to fight the fine. i refused to pay it. late fees started to build, and eventually i was summoned to an association meeting. i compiled a list of some of the most insane hoa regulations i could find, to compare to the insanity i was dealing with. i admitted that i changed the bulb intentionally, and plead with the hoa board to have a little reason. it turns out that while a majority vote was needed to pass a new regulation, a unanimous vote is needed to change or repeal a regulation. all of the hoa board members, with the exception of one- who just so happened to be the old woman who cited me for the violation to begin with, agreed that the rule was unnecessary. this old hag proceeded to argue that even though she didn't live on my street, my lighting had ruined her christmas, and presumably the christmas of everyone on my street. finally, someone on the board pointed out that while they needed a unanimous vote to change the regulation, they only needed a majority vote to remove another member of the board. an immediate vote was taken, and the lighting nazi was removed from the board. a motion was made to re-vote on my case, and it was immediately dismissed. i used to work as medic in the canadian oil patch, good job for the most part as it pays more and is less stressful than ground ambulance. i did a few years responding to 911 calls then took some time off to live in new zealand. when i came back to canada i was strapped for cash and looking to get back to work quickly so i took a job with the first company that called me back. interview goes well, i get a start date, a daily wage rate and for the time couldn't be happier. doing this job was apiece of cake, basically it involves sitting in a truck with a mtc ( mobile treatment center) stuffed in the box, think pick up truck with camper. mostly the reason medical staff is required has to do with ohs legislation. if you are x amount of time from hospital and doing "high risk" work you need dedicated ems . i spent 20 days away from home at this remote work site where they were fracking gas wells and by the 20th day couldn't wait to get home, i was excited to get my first real pay check in nearly a year and planning on first paying off some bills and then getting blackout drunk. this is where shit went sideways on me - i tore open the mail box like a child on christmas morning, grabbing my check i headed down to the bank. opening the letter i froze, wtf? i'm missing over 1,000 $ - a cursory glance at my attached paystub revealed i was getting paid 75$ per day less than i expected. "okay" i think to myself "must be a mistake, i'm sure they'll rectify it for me". the next day i went down to the office and met with asshat manager and a few other office people. we sat down and talked it over and i asked if it was a mistake and when could i be expecting the rest of my pay. am looked at me squarely and said " you won't be getting that extra money, i have discussed it with the rest of management and we have agreed no one told you that you would be getting 400 $ / day. we only pay 325$ to start" "well i'm not saying you all told me i would start at 400$. you am told me i would get 400 the day you hired me" he always had this creepy little smirk on his face and i began to understand the underlying reason( kinda looked like the " pedo smile") smirking at me he began " why would i start you at the top wage? we'd have no where to go, you wouldn't ever be able to get a raise and that wouldn't be fair now would it? " i replied " that doesn't bother me, besides you told me i would get 400$" with that smirk still plastered across his face he said " i don't remember that, did you get it in writing? " at this point i knew he got one over on me and while internally livid i tried not to betray any emotion. " no i guess i didn't " am- " well there you go, so let's get this settled while you are here, you'll get 325$ as a day rate and we're all in agreement. is that okay? can you live on that? " i agreed without too much fanfare and left wordlessley cursing him and his progeny down the generations. i start looking for jobs immediately as i'm not about to continue working for that asshole if i don't have to but remembering at the same time i'm not suited for unemployment. 3 days into my scheduled 10 off i get a call from am " hi astakask, can you work tomorrow? i've got a job and our medic is sick, it's really important, they're doing a large gas frac in the morning" "sure" i says. "great, you'll have to come by tonight and grab a truck, i won't be there so i'l give you the gate code to the yard and leave the keys in the gas cap". " you need to drive out to site tonight and be there for the 6am start" "you bet boss" i said barely keeping my voice even. at this point i decided to say "fuck it unemployment isn't all that bad" fast forward to 7am the next day. the phone call i was expecting from am arrives " where the fuck are you!??" " what do you mean? " "you needed to be at the jobsite for 6am! i just got a call from the oil company! where the fuck are you!!? " " i'm at home " " what!? you were going on this job, we talked last night!! " " hmmm, i don't remember this.... did you get it in writing? " i promptly hung up and then turned my phone off. now they couldn't start that job and it was my company's fault. if you know anything about fracking it's hella expensive and they ended up having to pay for all the labor costs during the delay. i got threats of legal action and such so i know it cost them thousands. i hope it was worth it. i don't burn my bridges, i take off and nuke them from orbit... it's the only way to make sure. it's been almost 8 years, that company eventually folded and nothing ever came of their saber rattling . i still get a good chuckle when i imagine that asshole going red in the face. tldr ; company didn't pay me what i deserved and it ended costing them thousands more. this happened a couple of years back. i'll try to keep it as short as i can with as much detail as i can. i was married for 12 years. my wife was a wonderful person. we had many laughs together and many great times as well. she also happened to be full of shit. between the years of 2004-2007, she had multiple affairs including: * my daughters 1st grade teacher * the security guard in the building where she worked * the son of one of her friends this went on for 3 years behind my back. i had no clue she was a cheating bitch. during the summer of 2007 i discovered the affairs. i confronted her with it and she didn't deny it. but instead of, you know, taking responsibility for it she told me she was running away to be with some dude she met on the internet. i thought she was joking and didn't take it seriously. the next morning she was gone. neither me nor my daughter saw her for a year and a half. it hurt her a lot because she really looked up to her mom. finally i got sick of hoping she would come back and i filed for divorce on the grounds of abandonment. she eventually came back and tried to act like nothing happened. didn't matter because i got full custody. she also tried to sue me for alimony but that failed miserably as well. the revenge? letting her fuck herself over. she lost all of her friends, is in a shit ton of debt and her parents hate her. she works as a waitress at a restaurant and is living with random people off of cl. but what i know hurts her the most is my daughter, who's now 17, wants absolutely nothing to do with her. she got her visitation rights terminated by the courts, so she can't see her either. the most pro revenge anyone could take is letting someone fuck themselves over. it's priceless. edit: thank you whoever gave me the gold!!!!when i was in the 3rd grade, there were a bunch of notorious bullies. a bunch of 6th grade girls who thought they were hot shit. they were always pushing the little kids in elementary around, shoving them out of their way and generally making their lives miserable. remember that girls tend to be quite a bit bigger than boys at that age, so when you're a shrimpy 8 yr old boy who's about 4 ft 2' tall, a 5 ft 2" girl's one handed shove might as well been a mountain giant swatting a flea. one day after being unceremoniously shoved sprawling out of the way in the halls of the school, i had enough. i stood up and told the girls that we were all sick of them and if they wanted to fight they would get one. this resulted in spontaneous fits of laughter. i told them we'd meet at the end of lunch behind the hill by the playground where the teachers couldn't see and we'd fight. but not just me and the shover. i told her to bring all her bully friends because they were all going to get it! me and my friends versus her and her friends. they scoffed, said i was a dead man and walked away talking about the ridiculous beating they were going to dish out on us "wimps". first recess, i talk to my male classmate friends. they agreed they were sick of being bullied and would all fight. but we knew we didn't stand a chance unless we got more help. so we hatched a plan. not just my friends, not just all the boys in my class, or even in my grade. *every boy in the school in grade 3 or lower*. we split into 2 groups and started recruiting. word started getting around there was going to be a big fight. lunch rolls around and we are scouring the playground. japanese kid practicing high kicks? come practice on the grade 6 girls! bunch of kids playing red rover? more fun if you throw yourselves into a bunch of bullies! these girls had earned a lot of animosity throughout the year and we had no problem getting everyone into our cloud of kids. by the time all my friends had met up, it felt like we had a monstrous unstoppable army. in reality it was prolly close to 60-70 kids. some, who didn't even want to fight but was just coming to see what the fuss was all about. when i got to the top of that hill, it was like aegon the conqueror, blazing his standard. our swarm crested that hill causing those 8 girls to just blanch. turn white, and freeze in place. we didn't even give them a chance to surrender and just charged down that hill at full speed. some of them screamed as they were being bounced around like ping pong balls by the stream of little bodies throwing themselves at them. all of them were knocked down. standing over a screeching girl who i had just bowled over. hearing her screech while she was getting pummelled by tiny fists and feet, i felt a great glory wash over me. i surveyed the chaos with pride as the girls started getting up and fleeing in tears. **aftermath** all the boys in our class were called into the principal's office. afterwards 8 of us were given weeklong after school detentions and our parent's were called. teacher was sympathetic, as she knew of the bullying and the detention was just free play with my close pals who pulled this off. **tl:dr** bunch of grade 6 girl bullies expect to beat up a few little kids and swept away by a sea of em instead. **edit** for clarity and grammar.in the music industry, certainly the 'production' side of things, we've all done shitty gigs. the sort of gig s that you know from the moment you get booked that it's not going to be fun. being female in this industry this sometimes works in my favour, sometimes not. so i get a call from a promoter who wants to put on a show locally and i got recommended to supply all the sound (i run a small pa rental company). i ask him the usual questions, "what's the load in/out time?" "what's the technical spec of the band?" "what's your budget?" etc etc. we agree a fee after 30minutes of telephone negotiating. we are both happy with this fee, it was £1,500 gbp, which is very reasonable for the personnel and equipment being provided. the only thing i always insist on when i'm working for somebody i don't know / have never worked with before is that i require *'cleared funds upon arrival at event location'*, a phrase that i rattle off many times a year and i never have any issues. me or my crew will bring £50k worth of gear, to your event, we will sometimes even start setting it up. but as soon as possible, you need to pay us. so this promoter showed us where to load in to this theatre/concert hall type venue. while my guys were walking around the venue checking the usual things like mains outlets, pa flying points etc i took the promoter to one side and produced my printed invoice and said my usual spiel... me: "i know you are real busy, we need to start setting up so if you can sort payment now then i don't need to bother you again." he did the whole 'looking guilty at his shoes routine', promoter: "umm i don't have all of you money right now, im waiting for my business partner he has your money. he has it all. can you wait for him to arrive?" me: "ok, its not a problem, what time is he due to arrive?" promoter: "around an hour or two before the doors open, he has to set up the bar, so he won't be later than this." me: "look i've not worked with you but in the spirit of future business relations i will take payment in full anytime before the start of the show." promoter: "thanks, he has the money it won't be a problem." me: "lol i know, if i don't have the money before the start of the show then i'm not turning the pa on." said jokingly, but with a stern face. so my guys setup everything, we work efficiently for the next few hours, the band arrive and we all get on well together. they are friends of the promoter and don't seem as bothered about the money as we do. i mentioned that this was the first show with this promoter and the drummer, who was the informal leader of the band, said the promoter has a different sound co. every time they gig. this gives me and the two crew guys cause to look at each other uneasily. we finish soundcheck and as the band head to their dressing room we sit around stageleft watching the audience spilling in. **showtime is t-minus 1hour...** i see the promoter hanging around stageright so i pop over to see him. me: "hey promoter, everything ok so far? happy with everything?" promoter: "yes very happy, everything's perfect, band say soundcheck went well, looking forward to the show..." me: "thats good, lets get payment out the way and i can leave you alone to enjoy the show." promoter: "errr listen, ticketsales have been slow for this show, can i pay you afterwards?" me: "i thought you had sold 1200? at £20 a head minimum, that makes at least £24000 you should have more than enough to pay?" i'm being kind, but very firm. "im sorry but you need to sort out payment before the show, we've trucked £50k worth of this gear here, we've even set it all up and so far you've had all this for free... sorry but i can't do the show without payment upfront. once we've done a few shows together and we've built up a trust then i can help you out, but this is our first show and i have rules, sorry." promoter: "ok let me see what i can do..." **t-minus 10mins to showtime...** my team is ready to go, but we are anxious by now about the 'dodgy promoter'. the band are with us stageleft and ready to go onstage. they know the situation. they know we've not been paid yet but they don't seem that bothered. they are friends with the promoter and seem to side with him. i'm almost thinking about starting the show and getting the money afterwards but i stop myself. 'don't break your rule' i tell myself. **showtime t-minus 1 minute...** the promoter comes over to stage left and tells the band to go onstage, he will intro them on. my team are all in position behind the mixing desks etc ready to go on my say so. i tug the promoters shirt by his elbow and look quizzical at him, "where's payment?" i ask. promoter: "yeah yeah [smiling] lets get the band onstage and i nip and get it for you while they are on. me: "but... [as promoter walks onto stage] woaahh!" i call after him, almost shouting. i am furious, i know that it is impossible to kill the audio mid-show and that riot may well break out if i did this. much easier to not put myself in the position to start with... i glance over at the front of house engineer who is looking at me for guidance... i did the classic 'flat hand draw across the throat' signal for 'kill it!' both my audio guys hit the global mutes on their desks and the promoter walks over to the centre of the stage and speaks into a microphone... but nothing and i mean nothing comes out... utter fucking silence.... the crowd boos, they cheer, then they boo again... the promoter looks over at me angrily sidestage, i gesture to him, rubbing my fingers together in the other internationally recognised gesture of 'pay me my fucking money!' things are about to get heated so i grab a mic we have setup sidestage but out of sight of the audience (we call them 'voice of god' mics, or emergency mics. "ladies and gentlemen, sorry but due to a foreseeable hitch this show will be delayed by 5minutes" cue audience chanting and lots of tension building up... a lot of sweat dripping from the promoter instantly for fear of his reputation. no word of a lie, i had full payment, in cash, in my hand within 3minutes. the show went ahead and i went on to do several other shows with this promoter, he never tried to screw me again. i was asked to submit this comment as a post, about one of my college buddies' pro revenge on his cheating girlfriend of 2 years. he found out that she was cheating on him and he was literally crying in his car for a few days -- he was planning on marriage and kids and the white picket fence with her. he didn't tell her he knew, he told her that he was going to his parents house for a few days to help them with some repairs. instead he hung out with us and cried, literally cried in front of his buddies, for a couple of days, we helped him get out of it. he sobered up and told us how he was going to destroy her and i didn't even understand it at the time. but he was headed to a famous law school and was thinking way ahead of us. he drove to his girlfriend's mothers house, over an hour outside of town, with her items from his apartment nicely boxed up, and said he wanted to leave them with her for [gf]. gf's mom and him had met several times, he had gone to their thanksgiving, etc. gf's mom was like, ok, but why? not suspecting anything was wrong. and he said something brief like, "i don't think we'll be seeing each other again, but i needed to get this box back to her. but thank you for everything you've done for me. i'm sorry it didn't work out." gf's mom is stunned and tries to ask why and what and everything but my friend just starts crying (i don't think intentionally) and runs off and drives away. he never broke up with the gf -- never even contacted her -- she heard about it from her mom, who called her immediately, and he received confused and angry texts from the now-ex on his drive home. a little while later (at least a couple of weeks) he gets an email from the gf's mom, i don't remember the specifics, but it was not "i apologize for my daughter" but more like "i hope you find a woman who loves you unconditionally" or something to that effect. he responded with something like "thanks, your note means a lot to me" -- nothing negative. dude is now a up-and-coming lawyer, and still gets texts from the ex saying that she constantly hears from her mom how she ruined it with the one good guy she had and how she doesn't deserve to be happy. friend has never responded to one text, and blocked her from fb. of course, this was all 100% planned - my friend wanted the hurt to come from someone who would stay in his ex's life, not from someone who would be quickly forgotten. he deliberately created a rift in the closest relationship that two women can have. and all in a friendly 60-second conversation with no harsh words or accusations. edit: my friend said he would join this thread a little later today!well, this story starts out like quite a few others have. i, being in the u.s. army, become attracted to a woman whom i end up marrying. at first, she's all i could ever ask for in a woman. sweet, caring, one hell of a cuddler. doesn't really like video games like i do, but makes an effort to get into them so we can spend time together doing something we both enjoy. &amp;nbsp; let's call her thundercunt, or tc for short, for reasons you will soon know. &amp;nbsp; i met tc through one of the other soldiers i worked with, who we will call bb (battle buddy), since he was not at fault in this. it was in the middle of the week, and i had just gotten a work order finished up and was taking a quick break for a drink of water. i heard bb asking a few other soldiers if they were open for a date for this coming weekend. now, i knew from a few other friends that bb was straight, so i was curious as to why he was asking. &amp;nbsp; long story short, bb had a female friend who was looking for a date for a movie that coming weekend. i offered to go with his friend (**big** mistake), and she and i hit it off rather well, and continued to see each other. months pass, it hasn't been enough time for me to consider marriage yet, but she has some spontaneous ailments (seizues, and they were legit) spring up out of nowhere. since these only seemed to happen in her sleep, and my command wouldn't let me stay off-post with her without being married... &amp;nbsp; **lightbulb** &amp;nbsp; we got a courtroom wedding 2 weeks later. the added bonus? not only could i stay with her while she slept to be ready in case of another episode, but my tricare would fully cover her medical costs. i was happy, she was happy, i got to tell my command "now you can't stop me from staying with her.", and we all lived happily ever after. &amp;nbsp; except we didn't. things went well for a while, as i described at the beginning of the post, but after a bit, i started noticing things. things like her needing to take her mother to the doctor's office quite frequently (her mother was sickly, so i didn't think much of it at first), or needing to head to the walmart 1 town over because the one in our town didn't have what she needed in stock. &amp;nbsp; things like the car i bought and let her use seen parked in a lot next to several different trailer parks in a month. &amp;nbsp; well, as luck would have it, right as i started to get suspicious, i came down on orders to pcs to korea. so, sidelining the investigation until i was able to continue, i packed, kissed my wife goodbye, and let the army send me where they wanted me. i spent a year in korea, then came down on orders for texas. i went there. it was there that i found out exactly what was going on, courtesy of her mom, brother, and her aunt and uncle. &amp;nbsp; this woman was sleeping with 60 (not even kidding in the slightest) different men, most of them soldiers. her excuse to her family was "frizzmaster is gay, and doesn't want to come out. so, he's pointing out the men i can sleep with, since he knows that they're clean." &amp;nbsp; so, basically, this woman is using me as a paycheck and meal ticket, and screwing everything with a pulse that happens to be male. the icing on the cake is that 2 weeks after i get the good news, she calls me and confesses to cheating on me....**once**. the only reason she confessed? she was pregnant, there was no way i could be the father, given that i was in a different state at the time....and the father was african american. &amp;nbsp; i am very much **not** african american, having been called "neon white" on more than one occasion due to my irish ancestry. so, there was no possible way this child would look like me, at all. so, my wife felt the need to break the news to me before she had the baby, because she could no longer hide it. &amp;nbsp; well, things happened, i went back home (without her knowing) and removed my belongings from the house i bought, to keep her from selling them once she realized what i was about to do, and started divorce proceedings. &amp;nbsp; this is revenge #1. i saw her **boyfriend** (not the baby's father, new guy entirely) driving my car. so, i enlisted the help of her aunt and uncle to get my car back. they pulled up behind him in a parking lot, got out and talked to him normally, at which time i waked up from the other side of the parking lot. her uncle asked to see the keys, and upon receiving them, began taking the car key off of the ring, and waved me forward. &amp;nbsp; i walked up, took the car key from him, looked at the guy, and said "hi, my name is frizzmaster, and this is my car. i'm taking it now." i waved him over to the sidewalk, removed everything from the car that didn't have my name on it, left the items with him, then got in my car and drove off. &amp;nbsp; i found out later that day that he had packed everything and left her. apparently, he had been living in my house, eating my food, sleeping in my bed, and **wearing my clothes**. plus, she had been using the money i sent her every month to pay for his court costs and child support costs. &amp;nbsp; well, months went by, our court date came up, and my lawyer recommended that i file for sole use of the vehicle and the property, since it was obvious that she had committed adultery and didn't have a leg to stand on. we go to court, she counter-files for the exact same, and since she refused to release the results of a paternity test, i get stonewalled. the exact words used by the judge were "i'm sorry, but without proof of paternity of the child, i cannot, in good conscience, approve either of these motions. &amp;nbsp; so, we set a new date for a private hearing with the judge, and we wait. nearly 3 months go by, and the court date was finally near. i walked into the courthouse, met up with my lawyer (who had a demonic glint in his eye at the time, and i was about to find out why), went into the courtroom, and waited. 20 minutes later, she walked in, shot me a dirty look (which i did my best to ignore), and sat down. &amp;nbsp; the judge came in 5 minutes later, the court was called to order, and the divorce trial commenced. here, i found out just what had given my lawyer the twinkle in his eye earlier on. he proceeded to ask tc a series of questions, including: &amp;nbsp; "is my client the father of your child?" &amp;nbsp; when was the child conceived?" &amp;nbsp; "where was my client during the time at which your child was conceived?" &amp;nbsp; "do you know who the father of your child is?" &amp;nbsp; "have you received child support from the father of your child?" &amp;nbsp; basically, he questioned her into a legal corner in which she either had to answer truthfully, or lie and suffer the legal ramifications of perjury in the face of easily provable evidence. she answered truthfully (lucky for her), and the court case continued. she presented her argument, littered with dirt she was trying to throw on me, insults to my person, questions about my sexual orientation, and claims that i was having a relationship with her 18 year old cousin. &amp;nbsp; i, falling back on my military training, simply sat up straight, folded my hands in front of me on the table, and stared at a spot on the wall slightly above the judges' left shoulder. i answered every question asked of me, offered no personal opinions, threw no dirt, and refused to sink to her level and question her sexuality. subsequently, she had a more and more confused look on her face as i refrained from bad-mouthing her like she was doing me, and the divorce trial went by rather fast. &amp;nbsp; at the conclusion of the trial, the judge looked over the paperwork submitted one last time, then looked to the both of us. "are there any closing remarks or claims that need to be made?" tc made one last parting swipe about me currently living with her aunt and uncle (i had rented my own apartment months ago, after finishing my military time and going back home), and i merely shook my head and resumed staring at the wall. the judge took one last look over the papers, set them down, and spoke the greatest words i have ever heard in my life. &amp;nbsp; "well, looking over the evidence and testimonies presented, there really is only one decision i can come to. mr. frizzmaster, i am approving your motions for exclusive use of the vehicle and property, upon undeniable evidence of adultery. mrs. frizzmaster, the only one of your motions i am granting today is your request for a no-contact order, and that is more for mr. frizzmaster's benefit than your own. you seemed very combative and willing to cause him legal damage that he was not due, and your repeated attempts to over-talk me while i was reviewing the paperwork did not speak well of you. you no longer have a claim to either the property or the vehicle, and will not contact mr. frizzmaster unless it is to have him clarify which items do not belong to you." &amp;nbsp; tc had the audacity to work up a sniffle and ask the judge "b..b.but where do i go? what do i do for a place to live?" &amp;nbsp; the judge looked back at her and replied "well, mrs. frizzmaster, you have 30 days to figure that out, after which you will not set foot on that property again, or else you will be held in contempt of court." **tl;dr: horrible wife uses me for a meal ticket while she indulges in a very active social life, and i respond by giving her a legal piledriver.**was told you guys would get a kick out of this, i had originally posted it to another topic but it was suggested i'd share it with you. so here it is! gather round boy and girls because its time for the story of my cheating ex-wife and how i fucked her. now bare with me as this is a bit of a long one but fuck it. so i had a feeling she was cheating as she set off a lot of red flags. constantly laughing and smiling when texting, saying it was just her mother when i asked. needing to stay late every night after work. when i'd call in her co-workers said she left hours ago. when i asked her what was going on she'd laugh it off and say it was just something they did to each other at the office all the time. the last straw to where i knew something was definitely up was when she went out "to get milk" at 11:30 at night and didn't come back till 2 in the morning. now if there is any words of wisdom i can pass on to others in all my years of experience, its if you think your significant other is cheating, hire a fucking private investigator. they're goddamn good at what they do and they will get some evidence that really helps in the later divorce. fast track to her birthday, several months down the road. now i know what you're thinking, why the hell did i wait months before i confronted her and did it really need to be on her birthday? the answer to the first question is i wanted as much evidence as possible to hand off to my lawyer as well as make arrangements to find a new place to live, etc. answer to your second question is of course it had to be on her birthday. you see after asking her what she wanted to do on her birthday this year she was rather insisted on me going out of town with my friends as she just had to work anyways and didn't want to be reminded she was ageing. so i know something is up and after finding a bottle of champagne and two glasses hidden in my closest something in my snaps. so i do what any sensible man would have done. i leave and go to my friends house pretending like i am going out of town. while there i call up her mother, father, sister and several of her friends. i tell them how i want to give her a big surprise by sneaking into her room with party streamers, kazoos and a big cake with candles. sounds fun right?! well boy was it. its 8:30 in the morning and i have everyone met just outside our apartment. we all pile in the elevator (about 8 of us in total), her mother holding the cake and me reminding everyone to be as quiet as they can be. my put my key in and unlock the door, we all sneak in and make our way down the hall towards the bedroom. each hold a kazoo and mom holding the cake grinning from ear to ear. well as i throw open the door and we all yell surprise. but the surprise was on us and there was my wife, bent over in doggy style position with her lover staring at us wide eyed mid thrust. mom drops the cake, sister screams, father begins to shout. i pretend like i'm horrified to which her friends try to push everyone out while yelling at her. wife, excuse me, ex-wife is sobbing and screaming how could i while the lover is desperately trying to put his pants on while running out of the place. needless to say, it was one of the best birthday presents i have ever given. tl;dr: gave ex-wife a kick ass birthday present. edit: broke up text so easier to read. edit 2: posted a response to try and answer most your questions. let me know if there is anything else you wanted to know.i was walking home after staying at work really late. walking through the bar scene, i saw a cab and was so tired i decided to take it home, the first time i'd ever decided to do so. short, aggressive ride where he's tailgating, honking, swearing, and aggro as fuck despite it being a sleepy city. fare: $6.40. i give him $20 and ask for $12 back. cabbie gives me $10 from a giant wad of money and says sorry, he doesn't have any ones. ok, dude thinks i'm drunk because he picked me up outside of a bar, and he thinks he deserves a better tip even though the ride was like 3 minutes. i say, what do you mean you don't have any ones, you're a cabbie, and i just saw your giant wad of cash. he persists. i say no, you're driving me down the street to that pizza shop and we're getting change. he says he won't. when i ask, he refuses to give me his name, and then gives me a menacing "get the fuck out of my cab," looking like he's going to punch me in the face. dude's definitely a tough guy and pretty scary (think short, stocky henchman type with buzzed silver hair and a leather jacket), so i leave, but not before catching his cab number as he speeds off. ok, it's the principle of the matter. this guy's doing this to drunk kids all night, and probably making a lot of money by intimidating and victimizing these customers of a public service. fuck that. i call the cab company and get my full $10 back, but it takes a bunch of harassment and several months to finally get it. fuck that. i call the cab company's director, who couldn't care less and who flat out told me he believed the cabbie's story over mine-- so not only is this shit happening, but it's being enabled and the complaints aren't being registered. fuck that especially. i tell him that if he doesn't take any course of action whatsoever then i'd be forced to take it up with the city's transportation oversight commission that oversees all this stuff. he basically dares me to do so. ok, so i enter into this ridiculously arduous process, where after reading up on the local laws i write a major complaint to the public commission and request they be fined under certain articles. a couple months later i get a response letter: cab company hires this sleazy ass lawyer who claims i'm lying about everything and had all this malicious intent. claims i demanded ones, and the cabbie didn't immediately procure them but then did seconds later, and at that point i was so fuming mad that i wanted to exact revenge. calls my character and credibility into question completely. the letter was so amateur and there were so many transparent lies in it that it was both laughable and sad. so i go to my "preliminary hearing," which i took to mean was just like filling out paperwork, or at most a private deposition or something. nope, everyone's there, including the cabbie, the bedraggled secretary who sent my refund, the cab company's director, the sleazy lawyer, a court reporter, and a judge. ridiculous cheap suits all around for the cab entourage. the in-person sleaziness of the lawyer did not disappoint-- think bad pinstripe suit and pink tie, slicked back hair, and pencil moustache, all resting on a sweaty and anxious fat man whose only apparent mode in trial is a combination of snideness and faux-suspicion. the cabbie's giving me threatening looks during the whole thing, and i'm frankly a little scared he's going to kick my ass afterward. as a bonus, the judge is relatively young, extremely polite, thoughtful, level-headed, and patient. we give our stories. cabbie gives this reeeeally terribly acted story of how i intimidated him into getting more ones, become furious, etc., but he can't even keep his facts together and keeps stumbling over his obviously rehearsed lines. sleazy lawyer tries to poke holes in my very simple and coherent story like it's a hardy boys novel (it was dark, you couldn't have seen the denominations of his money!). it's the cheesiest fucking thing you've ever seen. meanwhile i'm trying to cross examine him, while basically learning on the job how to be a hack lawyer at a shitty municipal hearing, and i even take a few jabs at the cabbie for lying on the stand that were met with various objections. you could cut the tension between me and this cabbie with a knife, and i made a lot of awkward mistakes because of that, but overall it went pretty well. a funny mistake i remember is that the lawyer made some objection, and i butted in and said "that's not even a good point," and the judge cracked a smile in agreement and then told me me i could not be subjective during the hearing. judge makes a ruling a few months later, noting that the cabbie was clearly not credible, and orders cab company to pay a $1500 civil penalty to the city for various infractions (fraud, not providing "reasonable service," and not identifying himself, if i recall). sweet, i think. but then, months later, lawyer issues an "exception" to this ruling, which i didn't know could occur, at around 9 pm the night it's due. the exception brings up all these reasons that they shouldn't be fined (e.g., there was precedent for this fine before) and also attacks my credibility once again regarding details of the story, basically threatening to undue the ruling if i didn't respond.. i get notice of this filing via email and frantically write up an official "response to exceptions," which was required to address these issues, and i submit it just under midnight. months later (i think a total of ~1.5 years since the incident after several filings and correspondences), judge examines the new material and rules that the $1500 fine stands. got any ones now, asshole? tl;dr: a cabbie wouldn't give me $2.00 in change so i went out of my way to make his cab company pay $1500 in civil fines. a couple years back i moved into this real exclusive apartment building in the miami beach area. i had no clue at the time my landlord was a fascist dictator. after she took my deposit and we moved in the problems started . she had all sorts of crazy rules like shirts on for men at the pool , no talking on cell phones in the hallway, no overnight visitors and a whole list of shit she literally made up and applied whenever she wanted. i knew she was fucked off in the head and we generally tolerated it until one day she decided kids were not allowed to play in the courtyard. she started harassing my son on a regular basis telling him he was not allowed to play in the courtyard. however i had an ace up my sleeve. see i took a real estate course a few years back and i knew that discrimination against kids in any way shape or form was against federal law. revenge time. i told my son to ignore her and play as much as he wants as late as he wants , granted he did his home work and his room was clean. one day she had enough and snapped even going as far as to scream at all the kids in the courtyard. she then knocked on every door who had a kid and informed them that playing in the courtyard by kids was not allowed. when she came to me i simply asked her to hand it to me in writing. she did. needless to say , i hired an attorney and won. 6 figure sum of which 30% went to my sons trust in his name. the owner of the building stood by her side the entire time and so rightfully the suit cost him the building. he was forced to sell the building. the new owner hired me as the building manager. i was the resident manager for over two years. pro revenge. one of my ex girlfriends had a mother who was a high school teacher. she was the sweetest thing, although was also a total pushover. for this story's sake, we'll call her margaret jones. when i'd visit my ex, this woman almost wouldn't leave me alone, constantly "can i get you something to eat?", "we had dinner earlier, can i warm something up for you", "oh! i remember you like this hot sauce, so i picked some up for you and it's in the cupboard - here, i'll show you where so you can use it when you would like!". total sweetheart. now, i can't particularly vouch for how she was as a science teacher, but i can only imagine she was probably overrun by shitty high school students who made her life hell. she probably had a hard time controlling the class in many situations. she just wasn't all that assertive. one day my ex calls me "holy fuck, you have to see this facebook group!", and sends me the link. it's titled "mrs. jones is a cunt hahaha" and has somewhere around 60 members, all high school students talking shit about this poor women, how they make her life hell and what they've done / said to her, etc. of course, my ex is deeply saddened because her mom is being slagged online. at this same time my ex was completing her masters in university majoring in psychology. her thesis was on bullying among teens. how ironic. my ex insists she contact facebook to get it taken down. i told her no. let me see what i can do first. this caused a bit of a fight between her and i as i'm one for teaching people a lesson, while she wanted to sweep it under the rug so her mom wouldn't find out and it'd just go away. further, she didn't like "eye for an eye" mentality. first, i screenshot every conversation, every comment, every photo - just in case it went away somehow. i then wrote down every name, made a nice little excel file with them all and began my quest. seeing as i knew where all these kids lived (well, the general region) i began to search out phone numbers or the kids who were stupid enough to link their parents on their fb accounts. i found numbers (or profiles) for almost everyone - in many cases, multiples. next up i compiled all the screen grabs into a nice little 1 page webpage highlighting the worst comments. people's full names as listed on fb, essentially nothing that wasn't already public information. i just aggregated it together into a cute little package. of course, this included phone numbers as well. links to the fb group and the comments were below every photo. now the fun starts. i begin calling the home phones of these kids one by one. a typical conversation went as follows with little deviation. "hi, is mr or mrs ___ available". "hello" "hi there, do you have a son/daughter named ____ " "yes, who is this".. "well, i'm a concerned internet user who's come across some very disturbing comments your child posted about their high school teacher" "oh, what?" "well, if you go to _______, i've put them all together with some links for you" * parent views page * "i.. uhh... i'm so sorry." "well, so you're aware, i'm calling every parent with this same call. when i'm done, i'm submitting this to both the school board head office and the administration of the school" "i'm so sorry my child did this.... *screams name of child - get in here now* " "thanks, try and have a good evening" i didn't get to find out the end details, but her mother obviously ended up finding out about the group, and the only info i got was that a "good handful" of the kids ended up getting suspended for between 1-5 days depending on what they said. that was great and all, but i'm sure the wrath the parents laid out was far worse. i smirked to myself throughout the entire thing knowing i was probably ruining these kids' spring breaks (as it was the week before). **tl;dr:** - found a hate group on fb against my ex's mom. got a ton of kids suspended and told all their parents, which was really the most satisfying part of it all.years ago, i worked in a 24 hour call center. it wasn't a bad job, but i was always getting pushed to the night shift. on the other side of the call center was a claims department that only worked the m-f, 9-5 shift and i jumped at the chance when a spot opened there. what a mistake. turned out the manager was this older female, emotional vampire (ev) who did nothing all day long, but try to get you to tell her the worst things that happened to you, in order to play dr. phil. she fed off of/craved these stories and the 3 other girls that worked there played into it. all day long there was nothing but drama and it was annoying, but i dealt with it by ignoring it as best i could. but that wasn't good enough for ev, she wanted my stories, wanted me to sit with them and hand wring and cry with them all day. (i nearly bought stock in kleenex). i refused to play along, drama bores me. so ev started this campaign of trying to get me to quit, in order to hire someone more sympathetic to their little circle. suddenly all of my work was sub par, i was always late or leaving early (i wasn't), she was bad mouthing me to everyone she could think of. she also got her 3 little baby vampires to harass me as well. nasty comments all day, stuff getting spilled on my desk at my bathroom breaks, my lunches going missing (being found in the trash). i'd finally had enough when she screwed me out of my raise on my bi-yearly review. i began secretly taking pictures of my desk before and after bathroom breaks, printing out the less than professional e-mails i was getting from her, kept an actual note on my desk that said "we don't want you here anymore". i took it all to my friend in hr along with my notice. (i'd found a better paying job anyway.) hr friend said she would look into it and was sorry to see me go. on my last day ev just smirked at me as i walked out the door, thinking that she'd won. but her smile wasn't nearly as big as mine when an it friend who worked there, sent me a framed copy of ev's "terminated for cause" letter a month later as my birthday present. i called my friend in hr asking how things were going. apparently ev tried the same drama routine on my replacement, who didn't play along either, and tried the same "get them to quit" tactics, not realizing that hr had sent a plant as my replacement, to verify my story.for a bit of background, this happened a few years back. smartphones we just starting to get cool and htc released the first android phone, the g1. i got one for myself and one for my wife for our anniversary, it was her first non-flipphone and she loved the keyboard. we worked together at a clinical lab running people's blood work and such, this is actually how we came to know each other. i called in sick one day and my wife went to work without me. while i was crashed out on the couch feeling miserable i get a email from her phone. i had installed a app that reports home with all kinds of useful information when the sim card gets switched out. later when my wife got home she asked me if i had seen her phone, thinking she had forgotten it at home when it was actually stolen from her purse at work. a few days later i am over my illness and back at work. knowing the phone was stolen, most likely by a co-worker, i decided to play dumb and talk very openly about how forgetful my wife is. saying things like "this is the third phone she has lost", i struck up a conversation with a girl that had been rumored to have sticky fingers. other ladies at the lab suspected her of taking money from their purses but nothing could be proven. if had gotten so bad they had to install lockers forum everyone. so after a friendly conversation with her she offered to lend me/my wife her old sidekick as she had recently gotten a new phone and wasn't using it. i thanked her for her kindness and asked if we could talk more over text. she gave me her number and i checked the email the lost phone had sent days previous. of course the number associated with the sim card that was put into my wife's phone matched the suspected co-worker's. i continued to play dumb and let her "kindly" loan me the sidekick to replace my wife's lost phone. she even offered to to sell it to me for cheap because we are "friends". i let it sit for a few days and when she began asking for money for the phone she had given me i laid it all out over text message. i informed her that i had proof of her taking the phone and i would go to hr if she did not return it. of course she denied the theft at first but agreed to all my demands and eventually admitted to having the phone, which she would return on condition of my silence. once my wife's phone was back in my possession i presented all the transcripts and relevant emails to the lady in hr that i was most acquainted with. after getting my email summing up the events she asked me out to lunch so i could give her the whole story, she was very excited to get to be a part of it. well a few weeks went by and nothing. then one morning (actually more like noon as i work 2nd shift) i wake to an interesting text. "how could you do this to me? i got fired today because of you. i though we had worked out a deal". i smiled to myself, got up and poured a cup of coffee. then i replied "dance with the devil..." and blocked her number. this just happened. i am flying out of seattle on an early morning flight. there is a long line at the security check in area. so long that it is overflowing out of the designated area. the airport has provided a person with an "end of the line" sign to keep things from getting out of hand. so i get in line and 20 minutes go by. there are about 30 people behind me. suddenly out of nowhere there is a new person in front of me. now, i am not sure about you but people who cut in line are second to serial killers for me. but maybe he is just mistaken so i tap him and tell him that the end of the line is way back there. this mofo turns around and says to me "no, the new line started right here". what the fresh fuuuck? the gall, the brazen shamelessness made my teeth gnash. and i can tell that other people in line agree with me. but this is seattle so everyone just silently seeths. meanwhile, a tsa agent standing nearby witnessed this entire scene. he comes over to me and asks "did that man cut?" and i answered in the affirmative. to this he replied "people like that never actually get ahead". little did i know his prediction would manifest itself soon thereafter. as we head to the conveyor belt where bags are x-rayed, this troglodyte is still in front of me. he puts his bags on the belt but they don't appear on the other end. finally it dawns on him, all his bags have been commandeered for " hand check". when the other passengers realize what happened there is audible celebration and jeering. somewhere out there there is a tsa agent who is judge, jury and executioner.years ago, i was quite involved in an active online community of analog audio hobbyists. people would occasionally put hardware and music up for sale on the message board we used. i'd been looking for a specific piece of hardware for several years to no avail. it was extremely rare and had never been sold in the us, so any examples would've been imported from japan. one of these machines 'popped up' for sale from someone in the community and i jumped on it. the guy offering it wasn't new but wasn't terribly active. somehow he'd obtained pics that weren't on the 'net and/or not easily searchable and ginned up a fake japanese bill of sale. in hindsight, he may have seen one for sale and stolen the images from that. regardless, it all seemed legitimate enough to induce me to go through with the transaction. so, paypal sent and he says it'll ship in about a week. then, the excuses begin. from he's been busy to out of town to his 'assistant' shipped it but didn't send the tracking number to providing a fake tracking number. then, he just quit responding to calls or emails. turns out the number he'd given me was a forwarding service that he subsequently disconnected. he also disappeared from the forum. he had, however, used his real name and a real paypal account. i filed a paypal claim, and of course they denied the claim on some technicality. i'm sure he was counting on this occurring. this is where the revenge begins with an unintended bonus. all i wanted was to make sure the guy knew i'd find him and get to him. i'd called the police and reported matters but they couldn't have given less of a damn. i decided to find him myself, and found an old wedding announcement that'd been posted on the 'net. i searched his wife's name and found mention of her being out on leave to give birth to their first child on her work website. bingo! i had a small gift sent to her workplace with my name on it, and called her work to say that i'm an old friend and don't have their contact info but wanted to wish them congratulations on the new child, and that i'd come see 'em soon. i had visions of his wife saying how nice it is that someone sent a gift to her work, etc and asking who i was. this apparently spooked him, because a cashier's check showed up for the full amount. now, what he hadn't counted on, and i didn't tell him, was that i'd filed a charge-back with american express after paypal denied the claim. my conundrum was this; the amex investigation was ongoing, and i had no idea if they'd overturn the chargeback or not. i also had no idea if the cashier's check was legit; i've heard of counterfeit checks being returned up to 45 days later. so i truly didn't intend to profit off this. but i did. the amex chargeback was resolved in my favor, which paypal clawed back from his account, shortly after the check was proven good. the kicker is; the guy had the gall to email and threaten to try to have me charged with fraud for the chargeback when he'd already sent the check! i simply responded and said "hey! great to finally hear from you! glad you're doing well, how's the baby? listen, i'm sure there's just been a mix-up and i'll be happy to pay everything just as soon i get the machine. i'm sure you understand why i want to receive it before i pay at this point. of course, if you do want to call the police, you're welcome to explain to them how you attempted to defraud me by selling something you never possessed in the first place. your call." never heard another word. i just hope his kid didn't have to go without diapers. tl;dr: scammer temporarily got one over on me. i got that one back and ended up with a bonus.on june 18th, i was rear-ended by a gray dodge ram. i caught it on my dash cam, and the man who hit me appears on the video twice. i got a picture of his insurance card, damage done on both vehicles, and license plates. he told me he would like to take care of this out of pocket, as he didn't want his insurance rates to rise. i was okay with this, i've done it before with no issues. the next week, i sent my truck in for an estimate. up until this, we had been texting back and forth with no issues. i emailed him a copy of the estimate....and communication stopped. after hearing nothing from him for 3 days, i called his insurance and filed a claim, because i'm not about to be jerked around. they came back in the same day, telling me he had stopped paying back in march, and so his insurance had been cancelled. they could not honor the claim. i was furious. i called and texted him relentlessly, with no response. he was not going to pay, and neither was his insurance, despite his insurance card saying it expired july 1. i called my insurance, and even though i was at no fault, i have to pay $500 for repairs (deductible). i immediately went to the denver county court, and filed paperwork for small claims, then on to the sheriff's department to serve him paperwork. the police were no help (shocker). the address he provided on his insurance was falsified, and after telling the deputy 4 times to run his license plates, he finally did. the same address was used to register his vehicle. there was no other way we could find him, and so i was hopeless. i was going to pay for this dickhead's damage, and he was going to get away with it. until this morning, i decided to do a few google searches for "his name, denver". a "ripoff" review popped up - a man with the same name had redone a patio, and did a shitty job at it, fortunately for me. i thought i'd go ahead and call the company. i asked the receptionist for an estimate/consultation to do some yard work, and specifically requested (name of dick face), as "i heard he was great at this stuff". she said he was great at landscaping, so i asked "he's the one who drives the gray dodge truck, right?". she said "yes". my heart stopped. that was all i needed. i called the deputy who was attempting to serve him, and they're currently on their way to serve the paperwork at his company. i fucking found you, you piece of shit, and i'm going to make sure you pay me. the court date is august 12th. i'll see you then. tl;dr - got rear-ended, the dick face was evading payment, and i was better than the police at finding him. also - everyone should own a dash cam. seriously. dash cam footage for you all - there was a woman, lets call her stacy. stacy owned a bar, stacy has a great personality, knows how to make drinks, and successfully ran a bar. stacy is a young, attractive, ambitious woman. unfortunately for stacy after she built up her bar her husband emptied her bank account and ran off with all the money. this devastated stacy and she didn't have the funds/will power to move forward. so she sold the bar and started to live off the sale of the bar. stacy improved herself a lot, stacy and i were friends, not best friends but we knew each other. i knew stacy was starting to run out of money (because she had mentioned this several times in facebook postings). well i'm friends with quite a few business people and over the course of the last several months i recommended businesses to her to go apply for a job, after the first recommendation she thanked me, applied and got the job. she quit that job (thats fine) i recommend her another job some time later. she thanked me, things didn't work out with that interview/hiring. life right? 2 weeks ago a bar starts looking for a manager. their offer is really competitive, high salary, profit sharing, etc. i tell stacy about this bar, and this is copied and pasted (only edited parts are the names) "club a is looking to hire a bar manager, they want experience, offer a good salary plus profit sharing go to their facebook page for more info" thats it, our messages for the past several months only had to about jobs, all very short, all very to the point. 3 days later she responds "i'm sick and tired of you stalking me, i'm not into you, stop messaging me" i qualify this that she meant this for me, and not someone else. she confirms its about me "stalking her" and how much of a pervert i am apparently. i stop responding. did i mention i'm good friends with bar owner from club a? i asked him if stacy had applied, he said she had and its between her and another guy. i said "let me show you our fb conversation and maybe that will help you make up your mind" so i hand him my phone, after reading it he says "i don't think i want a woman like this working for me" she did not get the job. she did not get the job. * fyi stacy has a boyfriend, has had the same boyfriend for quite some time. he's a good dude.i'm a student at a local community college because the gen ed classes are much cheaper. i had a heart transplant when i was younger but it was too late and now i suffer from chronic nerve pain that only gets worse the more active i am. so i have a handicap parking pass. one thing to note is that at this college with 5000+ students there's roughly 20-30 handicap spaces. on an average day there's more unused faculty spaces than handicap spaces total. fast forward to my third semester. i had gotten into the habit of arriving 1 1/2 to 2 hours early to make sure i got a handicap spot because the next closest spaces are about 1200 feet away and you had to climb a hill to get to the main building. i'd kill time by doing homework with my friends or playing d&amp;d. first day of the semester i park and as i'm getting my laptop out of my car i notice that another car had pulled up behind mine. the driver(older woman hereby refered to as eb, short for english bitch) asked if i was parking there, i of course answered "yes, i have a placard?" she scoffs and says out loud "who's is it? your grandmothers?" and drives away. at the time i didn't think too much of it. i'm young and don't have a wooden leg or anything so it's happened before. the next day i arrive like i always do and notice that all the handicap spots are full and that the same car from yesterday is parked there. this time i recognize the woman in it. she's an english professor. one of my friends has her for 18th century literature. i find this odd because the faculty spots are really close by. eb sees me and smirks. whatever i suck it up and park. that day me and my friends are playing d&amp;d in a room we found. eb walks by and sees me and my friends and tells us that we're not allowed to be there and we need to leave "this second!" now i'm really pissed. she's only doing this to be a bitch. we weren't hurting anyone and her class next door doesn't even start for almost an hour. but she still sits in that room and reads a novel. she does the same thing every chance she gets for weeks. so i've been thinking of a way to solve this problem for most of the semester. talking to the english department head(my literature of science fiction teacher) i find out that she doesn't even have a placard. the one she hung from her mirror is her grown sons. now i know what to do. here's what i did, reserved the room she had her class in until 5 minutes before her class for "dungeons and dragons club" with a sign and everything. then i alerted campus police that several people were using other people handicap tags. for those unaware you get paperwork when you get one validating that it's yours, in my state using one that's not yours is a towable offence and a automatic fine. so campus police start asking for peoples paperwork. that day starts like most others that semester, get there she's in a handicap spot. i go to play dungeons and dragons. but when she comes to kick us out of "her room" but she can't because i've reserved it. after i inform her of this she storms off mumbling about seeing the dean. she comes back for her class but by that time i'm on my way out. after my class i go out to the lot and notice that her car is missing. next day i arrive and ebs car isn't in one of the spots. it was towed. best feeling of my life that day. my friend tells me later that she arrived to class 10 minutes late that day and covered in sweat. she biked there for the rest of the semester. never had a problem with her for the rest of that semester.my mom has been a nurse for almost a decade now. 8 of those years she worked at the same hospital on one of the most busy floors to work on until she finally had enough of the piss-poor management. before she left, though, she exacted an amazing feat of revenge that got the hospital into a lot of trouble. as i said, mom worked on what was probably the busiest floor in the whole hospital. this particular floor is severely understaffed and many times there were only three or four nurses working, each one having to care for 10 or 11 patients each (sometimes even more). lots of times it would be pretty much impossible to get everything done in a 12-hour shift when you have to pass meds, tend to, and chart for that many patients. my mom is a great nurse. she is extremely smart, a hard worker, and she really does love her job. usually she would be the first nurse to get done with all of her work and then help other nurses with their workload so everyone could leave on time. her co-workers there loved her like no one's business. this kind of work ethic landed her a position as a charge nurse. as a charge nurse, it was her job to see to it that all (or most) of the paperwork is done properly and faxed, that nurses were getting their charts in on time and passing meds when need be. it was her job to interact with the doctors and fill orders and direct in case of an emergency. now, at this particular hospital there are a lot of residents who are fresh from med-school and have very little experience in a real hospital setting. sometimes they would give orders that were unnecessary or not the best solution for the health of a patient. mom - being so respected - would often times coax the doctors into changing their orders to something more suitable as she has a lot of real work-experience. but then, some doctors would disagree and tell the nurses to go on ahead with his instruction. then, when something goes wrong the blame would go on mom and there was really nothing she could do about it. she finally had enough when a doctor ordered a heart catheter on a patient who was extremely drunk and in no state of mind to make decisions for himself. my mom tried everything to get the doctor to not go through with it because the man really didn't need to have a heart catheter at all! this doctor was all the time ordering ridiculous treatments for patients because that is how he makes his money. he convinces this drunk man to sign the surgery papers and sends him to or where he was basically receiving an unauthorized surgery seeing as his decision making was impaired. after that, my mom decided to start applying for jobs at other hospitals because she couldn't stand to see any more patients being abused and mistreated by the place that is supposed to have their health in best interest. when she finally landed another rn position, she gave her notice and worked to the end of her term. after she recieved her last check they tried to tell her she was overpaid and she would have to pay back some of the money. obviously she didn't, and was appalled at the way they were treating her after 8+ years of loyalty to this hospital. so, she started plotting her revenge. before quitting, she contacted jcaho (joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations) and told them about the unauthorized surgery. this is a big no-no. it is something that can make a hospital lose their accreditation and be closed down permanently. she gave them the name of the patient, the file number, the case number, the name of the doctor and the name of all other parties involved in the surgery. she was very thorough. the day after she quit, a close friend of hers that worked the same floor said that a jcaho rep came and did some investigating almost entirely unannounced (they do warn the hospital before they come, but never give them enough of a notice to change anything beforehand). about a week after their initial investigation (one or two people had gone and interviewed staff and look at medical records), they came back again. this time they came with a lot of people. they pulled every single file to review and see if any other sketchy practices had been preformed under the radar. for every breach of hipaa and osha protocol, they were fined thousands of dollars. the doctor and all staff involved in the cardiac catheter incident were fired, and the doctor lost his license and can never get it back. they threatened to close the hospital if the fines weren't paid, which added up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. of course the family of the man found out about the surgery and sued the hospital (spoiler: he won) and had to pay him off, too. to this day jcaho visits the hospital frequently to make sure no more unethical practices happen again. don't treat your nurses like shit, and don't treat your patients like shit or it will come back and bite you in the ass. edit: word clean-uporiginally posted on from redditer /u/izzeo -- let's go back to january 2014 - we design a full working website. 15 pages, one of the best pages in our client's immediate area - by far, and that's not because it was our work. he literally had shit competitors. we finish the website, try to get a hold of him and he's traveling for business to find partners and vendors. he asks us to send it live since he'll be meeting a few people and once he makes it back home, he'll send out the invoice. january 20th, we still haven't heard anything back. we e-mail him, nothing. we call him, nothing. we spoof our phone number, instant pickup and he gives us a bs excuse that he's been up to his neck with work but has us on his schedule. february 20th, nothing from said client, we decided to pull down his website after sending him 10 e-mails, calling him 5 times, and sending him 3 warnings. february 20th 9:00 pm, he calls me pissed of that he's in the middle of a conference and hasn't been able to checked his e-mails or phone but a client told him that his website was down - keep in mind we're hosting his website as well. march 15th, we again tried to call him, etc. nothing comes out of it. for this particular client, march to april was the busiest time of year. his website was getting 100+ visitors per day and people were actually using a lead generation form. we again decided to shut it down and he immediatley called us back. "due to the fact that you have disrupted my business multiple times, we're not going to pay. you need to have our website transferred away from your servers and into our servers or we will pursue damages." march 16th, we contact our attorney (a few companies and i partnered up to have an attorney on retainer. $120 per month for free legal services when we need them? not bad at all). the attorney tells us to fuck him, our contract protects us and to simply bring down the site. march 17th, we shut down the website and put a for-sale advertisement on the site. we start to advertise the website on facebook and contact several of his competitors. march 17th, client calls us and tells us that he's getting an attorney and that i'm not authorize to sell his domain name or website "generic-city-keyword.com" that we were going to sell to him, but he never paid. march 18th, competitor in desperate need of clients calls up. he doesn't really have the money up front but he will meet us with a cashier's check for $1,500 and $500 in cash if we can sell it to him. he'll pay us $500 per month for the next 5 months for the rest. march 19th, we transfer the site, and our new client instantly gets a call from a new vendor and he pays us the rest of the money that same day. march 21th, we get a law suit from an attorney. march 27th, we counter sue and go to court. --- attorney business. april 20th, we go to court, ex-client loses. he pays for all our damages and attorney fees and pays us $700 for loss time. present: client has a website tonight page, 0 seo ranking and he has lost a lot of business. his company was one that lived or died through seo services. he lost 4 employees that ended up getting hired by the guy who bought the website. we saw our new client at a chamber event and he couldn't be happier. he was about 8 months from going broke, and now he has a business that is expanding. he does lawn care, christmas light installs, flower shop, pumpkin sales, and christmas tree sales. every season he has something else going on. the website has a page for each of the services and seasons and gets him a bunch of traffic during those times.met a man a few years ago. we became good friends. after awhile i got a promotion at work and had to move. i was looking for someone to take over my lease, he without me asking said "i'll take over your lease, what are the details" i explained the terms of the lease, asked him if he was cool with that. he said "yea" so we agreed he'd pay me the deposit, we'd sign over the lease to him, when he moves out landlord will give him my deposit. boom everything is cool. day to sign the lease comes up, he's a no show. he's dropped off the face of the earth. he blocked my number and stopped talking to me. this end up costing me $800 (i had to pay a month worth of rent as i looked for someone to take over the lease) it really pissed me off, cause you see he approached me saying he wanted to do it. he committed to me that he would deliver and then he drops off the face of the earth. he never came to me and gave me an apology, or an excuse. i get it shit happens. about a month after this all went down i get a random message basically saying "do you know where justin is?" i go "no who is this" responds this "this is justins girlfriend, i'm looking for him" we get to talking, turns out this girl loaned justin $5,000 and he just straight up told her he can't pay her back and wouldn't speak to her in person. i shared my story on how he fucked me over too right around the same time. i suggested we meet up. she agreed and a few nights later we met up for some dinner and drinks. now justin has given this girl the raw end of the deal and she was sick of it. he had sold some of her jewelry, cheated on her, not paid back the loan, and all around was a real dick to her. she then said "i just wish i could get back at him for some of the shit he did" i jokingly said "you could fuck me, i was one of his friends" she then looked at me, and said "think that'd piss him off?" i reminded her he was always the jealous type. he was, and that her sleeping with one of his friends would piss him off to no end. so we ended up going to a hotel and fucked like dogs, all in the spite of the justin. afterwards she snapped a picture of us together in the hotel each one of us holding our underwear with the message "just had the best sex ever" he was super pissed he responded immediately. she pushed him telling him how my dick was bigger then his, how i was a way better lay, and so on and so on. and ladies and gentlemen that is how i met my now fiancée and future wife. thanks justin! i lost $800, but i got an awesome woman in return.back when i was in college, i used to wait tables to pay the bills. i worked at a high-end restaurant in the "downtown" area serving both lunch and dinner but dinner service was where the bulk of my income came from. because most of the hostesses for were in high school, the managers asked servers to volunteer to host for lunch service which i volunteered to do one day a week. the shift was always shown on our server schedule. one day i came home in the afternoon and had messages on my answering machine from my frantic 19 year old manager asking where i was and saying i was scheduled to hostess. i was surprised because i swore i wasn't scheduled and since it was after lunch service i went in for my dinner shift as scheduled. when i got there, i confirmed i didn’t have a shift marked on the regular schedule but someone pointed out since it was summer and high school was out, the manager created a separate schedule for hostesses and i was scheduled there. i talked to a manager and explained what happened but they sent me home from working my dinner shift anyhow. angry that i was punished something i didn’t feel was my fault and because i was actually volunteering to help out, i took a note to the office the next day saying that since i was not hired to work as a hostess and it was now affecting my income as a server, i did not agree to work anymore hostess shifts. well, turned out, they had me scheduled on a second hostess shift that week which again, i did not know about and didn’t show up for. sure enough they fired me and it was only a couple weeks before i was about to leave on a long summer trip overseas. since i had heard from people in town that the tip out policy for the restaurant requiring us to tip 5% of our tips to the kitchen staff was illegal; i did some research, found out it was, and made a trip to the labor board with a copy of an employee hand book and filed a complaint. took them awhile to go in and investigate but about a year later, i got a check for $2k they had to reimburse me for those tip-outs and found out it cost them a total of over $500k to reimburse all the restaurants' employees (they have to go back 2 years from the time they go in and investigate) and paid a ton of fines. the bonus on top of it all was it turned out they had underage migrants washing dishes when the investigators went in so they got hit with additional violations for that. tl; dr – wrongfully fired so i filed a complaint with the labor board over violations that cost the owner over half a million dollars. edit: since a few people have asked about what state this occurred in etc, i found the following [fact sheet]( from the u.s. department of labor. therefore, it appears this is applicable in all states. &gt; tip pool: the requirement that an employee must retain all tips does not preclude a valid tip pooling or sharing arrangement among employees who customarily and regularly receive tips, such as waiters, waitresses, bellhops, counter personnel (who serve customers), bussers, and service bartenders. a valid tip pool may not include employees who do not customarily and regularly received tips, such as dishwashers, cooks, chefs, and janitors. throwaway because i don't know if i could get in trouble for posting this or not. so, the other day my strict manager was in a particularly good mood and told us this story and i thought it belonged here. a week or two ago it was dinner time on a friday, so, like plenty of other restaurants, we were really busy with a long wait. a former employee from a different location comes in to apply for a job. because of how busy we are the manager asks the cashier for basic information and her resume so he can look her up in our system. he finds out that she can't be rehired (per company policy) so he has the cashier tell her that the restaurant is too busy for a manager to interview her. despite not getting an interview the girl and her friend decide to eat dinner. and not pay. my manager looks over the tapes and sees the girl applying for the job walk around through the store section of our restaurant, go to the bathroom, and leave. a few minutes later, her friend does the same thing. luckily, he has all of her personal information on the resume she left, as well as information on her car from security cameras. what does my manager do? he calls her back up and apologizes for being so busy, maybe she could come back in for an interview with him. she wants to know when, so my boss lies and says that he's leaving on vacation for a few weeks and it would be best if she came back in as soon as possible. an hour later, he sees her car pull into the parking lot and calls the police. he sits down with her and conducts an interview like any other. he excuses himself to "go get some availability paperwork" and comes back with the receipts and confronts her about not paying. she immediately starts freaking out, saying her friend told her she would pay for her meal and talking about how her friend was always stealing from her, and she shouldn't trust her friend anymore. she offers to pay for her meal, but says she won't pay for her friend's. my manager tells her that she'll pay for both, or he'll bring in the police that he's already called. she pays for both meals and leaves a nice $5-$6 tip. then she asked my manager, "wait, you didn't just bring me in here to have me pay, did you?" my manager tells her of course not, but that she should come in tomorrow and ask for theresa (our general manager) so she can interview her. sure enough, she comes in the next day and asks for our gm. theresa tells her that not only will she never work at one of our restaurants again, but she is not welcomed back at our location. a lot to go through for a dine and dash, but still amusing if you ask me.i stumbled over this subreddit and immediately knew that i had a story to tell that fits perfectly in here. &amp;nbsp; this was about a year ago. i had just moved into my new flat because the previous one was quite uncomfortable, as the owner and other flatmates were generally dicks. lots of clashes with them and lots of leassons learned on how not to deal with people. your usual college experience stuff, you know? &amp;nbsp; now i had a job and money: time to live on my own! &amp;nbsp; i move in and all is fine for a month. but i am exposed to loud gaming noises. i'm a gamer myself, so naturally i am not too annoyed about this. but these game noises would normally not stop until 1am/2am. which is kinda shitty for my sleep-cycle and the enjoyment of weekends. trying to do the civil thing i ask the neighbour to turn it down. turns out my neighbour is from new zealand and doesnt speak german. (hint, this is all taking place in germany) my english is good enough to have some chitchat and i try to build a friendly "bond" by idenitfying that he is either aussie or nz. he's amazed by my english and confirms to be a kiwi. he concludes with saying that it is no problem to game quietly; says he can do that definitely. &amp;nbsp; however: no noticeable change in volume. rinse and repeat the same over the following week with very short convos about the noise and nothing else. i get a bit more annoyed on a thursday at 00:30, explaining that i have a job in the morning and i'd like to be on time and well rested, etc. to that i simply get a "fuck off, you've been annoying me already enough. suck it up like a man", and he closes the door. further attempts from me to just figure out wtf just happened by ringing the doorbell and knocking are ignored. his dog goes apeshit at the same time. &amp;nbsp; i am short tempered. &amp;nbsp; fuck this guy. i take some ducttape and tape his doorbell button so it constantly rings. gotta be efficient about this; it's germany, it's the law to be efficient. also, gotta be smart about this. i pull my fuses for the entrance hall that supply the light and doorbell. all in preparation of that piece of tape clinging to my doorbell. &amp;nbsp; i try to go to sleep, deducing that the idiot is trying to ignore the doorbell for a good 5 minutes before i hear it stop. i guess he figured out it was just a tape. the next morning i see the tape on my doorbell. can't get me with my own weapons, sucker... &amp;nbsp; fast fwd two days. gaming noises at 23:00, same annoying volume. i am pissed off and knock on his door. no answer. by now the neighbour on the other side has come to the hallway and asks what is going on. i tell him about the noise issues and he just confirms that its quite normal for that guy but he can't do anything permanent about it. but he offers to call the cops, as he has done that before many times. &amp;nbsp; i go back inside and notice the gaming volume has massively increased. what a spiteful sucker... i can also make out that he's gaming on xbox from the notification sounds that pop up every now and then. knowning that i have a potential ally calling the cops, who is already openly in hostility with this guy i wait for the cops to arrive and find his extremely loud gaming. &amp;nbsp; coppers basically tell both of them to respect the rules of being quiet after 10 and to not be dicks about it. i fight the urge to enter the hallway and openly reveal myself to the asshat neighbour as being involved with the cop call. a lesson i learned from previous flatsharing: fuck em without implicating yourself as the origin of the trouble. it makes you less of a target and hides that you have a motive for possibly grey-area stuff. i heed this advice very closely. &amp;nbsp; and that would've been the end of it if my beloved fucktard neighbour had stuck to the copper's advice. basically the second the coppers left in their car i am back to experiencing him losing at whatever shitty game he plays. &amp;nbsp; i immeditately complain to my flat owner via phone about how to solve this and that i am super unhappy with the noise and i ask what can be done about it. my landlord tells me that the flat next door is not owned by her, but by someone else named fritz (name obviously changed for this story), and that therefore she cannot do much about it other than complaining to them. after some digging by checking door labels and postboxes (and basement storages) i find out that the collosal dickbag neighbour is living with the daughter of the flat owner lady fritz. &amp;nbsp; shit. &amp;nbsp; i know that the landlord-kicks-teneant-out angle is now impossible or very unlikely... however i have never seen that girl walk in or out of his apartment, or seen her any other way. also, he plays loud console games until 2am. i'd like to meet a woman that would live with me and let me do that. i doubt they exist. from this i assume the girl isnt even living with him, or not anymore, or something shady is going on... &amp;nbsp; i had many nights awake that i could have called the cops, filed complains, tried to get restraining orders and whatnot. but i literally have no time or knowledge about this stuff, and i asked my landlord to pursue the legal route for me. which was not really yielding anything. i doubt she did anything. &amp;nbsp; meanwhile i spent the occasional sleepless night planning and plotting. this guy will go down. &amp;nbsp; i take the latest house-mail informing us about "chimney cleaning and lift maintainance" and create a lookalike. (i work with photoshop and indesgin a lot, so this was easy). purposefully and to stay on the legal side of this i replicate a lookalike logo, different header and footer, but same font and fontsize for the body. &amp;nbsp; half an our later a super nice letter is made, detailling how this building we are living in has decided collectively that garbage separation is a scam and therefore no longer a thing that applies to us. (in germany, afaik, by law a requirement to save the environment: so all your organic waste cannot go into the same bin as your plastic or paper shit goes. we separate plastics, organics and paper. heck even bottles into white, brown and green glass). &amp;nbsp; queue evil grin. &amp;nbsp; i put this notice folded correctly in the retarded way our building association folds their stuff and put it into his mailbox. &amp;nbsp; he always keeps his trashbags in front of the door on the hallway until he feels like carrying them down to the trashbins two or three days laters. (which annoyed me as well). it used to be two bags: the classic "yellow bag" which we use for plastic trash, and a regular bag for food waste and similar stuff. &amp;nbsp; now it is just the yellow bag with all shit in it. i have my confirmation. that dickbag is an idiot who can't tell legit from fake. plus he's in for a fine and citation from the garbage service, as they literally don't take his yellow bags if they can see stuff that doesnt belong in there. (the yellow bags are translucent, google "gelber sack") &amp;nbsp; the citation is just a nice side effect: i have my knowledge now that this guy is not mentally alert enough to properly factcheck stuff. a very bad habit but very important to know. &amp;nbsp; got him fined: ☑ &amp;nbsp; by now, in mid summer, this guy is smoking a lotand gaming less. and if i have my windows open all his shit smoke enters my flat and upsets me even more. boy, this guy is trying hard to annoy me. as soon as i try to communicate with him all i get is rude curses and insults in his accent that i find kinda hilarious. definitely not a pretty reply to "hi there...". i close this window-to-window conversation by thinking to myself "ok, enjoy your cancer...". i think since then he trys to smoke more often out the window just to piss me off. &amp;nbsp; fine by me. i fire up indesign and set up a new letterhead and logo. this time from a well known tobacco company. i write up a letter directly addressed at him. contents are some copy pasted marketing bs from their website which then i conclude with a statement of how the company knows that he is a person making good descisions and knows what is good. to thank him for this the company has included two cigars as complimentory gift. i fix it up in an envelope and use my company's vaccum-package-sealer thingy to make it into these typical gift-letter-thingers. i slap an address onto it send it through proper mail for that extra bit of authentic mail stamp and handling. cost me probably all in all 10€. &amp;nbsp; yes, i am trying to incept this guy. yes, i am literally trying to give this guy cancer. i have a short temper. &amp;nbsp; i admit it wasn't too successful. i hoped he'd switch over to 100% smoking cigars, but i couldn't lace the cigars with crack or some other drug to make him addicted. but still i know that he was buying cigars every now and then and smoking them. &amp;nbsp; as for me. i simply closed my window and that was the end of the problem for me. &amp;nbsp; accelerated his cancer: ☑ &amp;nbsp; back to tackling the flat-owner problem: oh boy... the internet is lovely. i know quite a lot of detail about this guy and his girl thanks to linked in, instagram and facebook. that shit should be illegal seeing how easy it is find out stuff about people. its scary. i locked my stuff away super quick after this. finding out someones email via linkedin is/was also dangerously easy. &amp;nbsp; now i find out how this guy can live there and play until 2am. the girlfriend is not living in germany, but studying in denmark. i assume they visit each other occasionally, or its really just a house-sitting arrangement, but fb tells me they are an item so i rule out the house-sitter theory and alogn with that any hope that this problem will resolve itself once she comes back. &amp;nbsp; my landlord has given me the phone number of the fritz flat owner, who i should call if the problem gets out of hand. i did that few times and it worked barely two times. &amp;nbsp; bless skype sms service. i quickly make a new skype account, get 5€ for skype credit and i get ready to text that lady from an anon-account. (i dont trust the free-sms websites) i send that poor old lady a text in german saying that i suspect asshat guy is having an affair with someone, but that i am unable to reach said daughter directly. singed with generic german girls name. &amp;nbsp; the back and forth annoying continues for a while until the end of september when the daughter returns to live in the apartment. lo and behold. the gaming at 2am stopped. i am almost happy, had i not set my sights to destroying this asshat idiot. i can't just leave stuff unfinished... &amp;nbsp; that skype acc with credit comes in handy again. i start calling the number that this loud flat had provided in the general neighbour contacts sheet. the one number was a landline number, the other was a mobile number, so i had a 50-50 chance of getting the guy or the girl when i call either line, at first worried about this i decided that was actually favourable. &amp;nbsp; so i start calling their landline (seriously, who the eff has a landline anymore?!) at random times of day, one or twice a week. always when i know the fritz daughter is home. when she picks up and says her name i just hang up super quick. right after that i call the mobile number, which to my luck turned out was the guy's mobile number. he picks up and i give him with distorted voice and heavy german accent (that i assume was good enough to conceal me) some random trash talk about cigars, pretending i was a sales rep from the tobacco company. i keep the convo short and try to ask questions that have him say answers like "yes", "sure" and "don't worry". then i try to go for the kicker: i ask him if he would like to be invited for a tobacco trade festival the next weekend. it would be out about 4h of drive of town, beginning on a saturday at 8pm and running for the entire sunday. &amp;nbsp; i was trying to get him to yell out loud "next weekend, sure!" or "i'll be there!", but he didn't. i spun along some crap details to give him more security and a sense of legitimacy of this. he reassured me he would be there. i asked if xyz was the name that should be on his reservation for one. sadly, due to high popularity, he couldn't bring a spouse. "it's ok, she doesnt smoke anyway.". after saying thanks we hang up. &amp;nbsp; i wish i could've been a mouse in the wall listenting to what fritzdaughter was asking and saying. &amp;nbsp; now here i lose my firm grip of the situation a bit, as i couldn't get 100% exact confirmation that he actually left on saturday midday for the distant city. but it wouldn't matter really. he just needed to come back super late or the next day with an excuse that the entire thing didn't exist and was fabricated. (which i hope the fritzdaughter figured out as well). &amp;nbsp; i bought some new boxers and wrote in my best girly-handwriting a note: "you forgot that, asshole. also, why are you still living with that bitch. it's over!" i put both the boxers and the note into their mailbox and hoped that fritzdaughter would be the one opening it. now there is a problem. the post doesnt deliver on saturdays or sundays here in germany. so i had to get her to check her postbox. &amp;nbsp; i walked over to the fritzflat and rang the bell. fritzdaughter opened and i ask her whether she had also gotten the letter about some excuse for misinformation about garbage separation some months ago and that there is a way to claim damages because of fines that occured due to misinformation. i couldn't quite figure out who to call about this, and was wondering if she had already done this, mentioning that i was relieved that this letter was handed to me today in person. she told me she didn't receive one. "ah, possibly they will mail it to you then", and i said goodbye and left. &amp;nbsp; i went into my flat and waited for the fruit of my subversive labour to be ready. i didn't confirm that she checked the postbox, but i know she did sometime. because the asshat guy came back at around 23:00. how do i know. the walls a thin and a pissed of girlfriend can be super loud and very expressive in her language. i couldn't make out too many details, but i'd like to think that my plan worked out perfectly well, as she kicked him out right there and then, which again could be heard very loudly from the hallway. &amp;nbsp; got him kicked out: ☑ got his gf to dump him: ☑ &amp;nbsp; he left with his dog. which is a shame, as it was als my goal to make him lose ownership of the dog as well. but i guess i can't be too cruel. if i wasn't already seeing someone else, i'd probably would've started courting fritzdaughter as a cherry on top. but ehh... &amp;nbsp; tl;dr neighbour is superfuckinloud, make him get fined, make his gf dump him, get him kicked out and sped up his cancer. gg &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; edit: reddit formatting. it is hard. this is as good as it gets. edit2: thanks for reddit gold. :o i don't know what do with this. does anyone want it?my grandmother got married in 1962, to a young man in the military. for a wedding present, their parents bought them a house in a nice suburb. white picket fence, whole 9 yards. not long after they moved in, the next door neighbor planted a mullberry tree on the side of his property, near my grandparent's driveway. nothing seemed amiss, but if you know mullberry trees, you know that shit is about to get real. about 15 years later, the mullberry tree was obnoxious. the birds would come and eat the berries, and any car parked in the driveway would get shit on, and it would stain the cars and ruin paint jobs. my grandmother, upon realizing the culprit, baked a nice apple pie, walked next door, and asked the neighbor if he'd mind trimming back the branches of the tree that hung over her driveway. he told her not to worry, he'd get to it soon. three days later, my grandmother opened her door to find a half-eaten pie in the plate, crawling with ants, and a note that said "i changed my mind." my grandmother threw out the pie, cursing up a storm, and swearing up and down she'd get him to trim that tree or get him back. city ordinance said she could not trim the tree, as the roots were on his property, so the whole tree was his property. as the years went by, my grandmother repeatedly asked him, ever so nicely, to trim it back. his responses were always along the lines of "no" and "fuck off." finally, in the mid-90s, my grandmother retired, and received a large bonus from her employer for her 35 years of work. she took the money, and bought the empty lot on the other side of the neighbor, then went to a nursery and bought 16 mullberry trees, planting them along her property line, on both sides of his property. about 3 years ago, he became angry at the damage they were doing to his cars, and cut them all back without permission. my grandmother took him to court, and he was forced to reimburse her for the trees at a markup because they'd had 10 years to grow.a certain adviceanimals meme brought this memory to mind. this happened a good ten years ago or so. my dad has a group friends from highschool who all own jeeps and go jeeping together several times a year. they are all old highschool friends from a suburban type town, plus a couple of family members who've since joined the "band wagon." one of those guys, let's call him randy, got some awesome prorevenge. now randy is a nice guy, through and through. he's the kind of guy you feel you could trust with just about everything, and sometimes he gets stepped on because of this, but he keeps on going because he's far above bitter resentment. randy also has a nice red jeep [that looks like such if memory serves]( he takes on the trails with my dad and the rest of his friends. it looks like your standard jeep, but he's put a lot of money into it, fixing it up and modifying it to run the trails they like to go on. turns out someone else decided he had a nice jeep, too. randy wakes up one morning to find his jeep gone. it doesn't take long to realize it's been stolen. they rally a search, call the police; nothing for about a week until they finally find his jeep flipped over and stripped bare in the middle of an orchard. several thousands of dollars and days worth of time - poof - gone to one jerk. but whatever, randy shrugs, hauls it back, and takes his sweet time trying to restore his toy. several months go by. the police have no luck and we're all convinced the guy got away scot-free. i mean, most of the parts were standard stuff. they probably got separated and sold off on ebay. heck, he could be selling them a next swap meet and there'd be nothing we could do about it because how could we prove those parts were randy's? it's a done deal, we realize. nothing to do. we kind of even forget about it all for the most part. then, one day, my cousin in the next town over gets a knock on his door. now my cousin is basically mid age between me and my dad. he has his own jeep, goes on trips with everyone else, and so he thought nothing of it when some random guy knocks on his door telling him, "hey! i saw you had a jeep. i happen to have some jeep parts for sell. are you interested?" "of course!" my cousin says without thinking. "what do you have?" "a whole lot, come on over!" so my cousin goes to this guy's house and sees an array of jeep parts, including a hardtop shell. he thinks to himself and says, "you know, i have all of this, but i have a buddy who's looking for a lot of this stuff. here's his number." the guy, also not thinking, says "yeah! let me do that." so randy gets a call from a guy trying to sell jeep parts in the next town over. why not take a look? he thinks. he calls my dad and they head over in my dad's truck prepared to buy some parts. they start talking with guy, looking at the stuff, realizing he has a lot of the same things randy is looking for. everyone gets happy, seeing that a transaction is about to occur. then randy and my dad start noticing things. that part there? look at that weld. that's not standard. that looks an awful lot like the weld you and i did. oh, look at that. didn't we repair that part just like that, too? wait a second . . . it dawns on randy that he is looking at his own shit, and the guy trying to sell him this stuff is the thief. his mind flashes red, his eyes go wide, but he's not prone to violence and thinks ahead. he wants prorevenge. he realizes instantly he can't prove any of this stuff is his. how could he prove that weld was done by him? you can't. he's only got one saving grace: the hardtop shell still has the original lock. and back home, randy has the original key hanging up in his garage. "you know, i'd really like to buy this stuff," he says to the thief. "let me go get my trailer cause the truck we brought isn't big enough." "absolutely!" says thief. today's his lucky day, he's sure of it! so randy goes home, calls the cops, grabs his old key, and heads back to thief's house. with cops standing by as witnesses, he walks up to the hardshell top and opens it. randy gets every single part he lost back and thief goes to jail. always keep the keys.i am a season ticket holder for my local mlb team. currently in my second year but this happened last year. one lazy saturday afternoon i was planning to use the tickets i had for the day. i have 2. my friend had to bail last second so since i'm not that far away from the park i decided to just go ahead and go by myself. it was too beautiful a day not to. after getting a beer and some nachos, i head down to my section. i see the majority of the row is filled including my seats. this is definitely not the first time this has happened and usually if its kids i just sit somewhere else near by and enjoy the game anyway. last year the team wasn't doing very well and there more than a few open seats. so i end up sitting in the same row about 5 seats away. well about 10 minutes later the rest of the group came back from wherever they were and i was sitting in their seats. one of them says "hey can you move, we were sitting here". before i could respond or even just politely move, their friends who were sitting in my seats chime in and say "yeah we don't who that is, he's just been sitting there like a creep since you guys left" i get up and say to the kid who asked me to move "oh i'm sorry" and walk over to the one who called me a creep and said "get out of my seat." i showed him the ticket and with little protest he moved to the end. then i looked at his friend and said "you, too. these are both mine." for two innings we sat their awkwardly. best part was when i ordered a hot dog and another beer so they would have to pass it down to me. eventually they moved, but i felt pretty good about how i handled the situation. this is not my story it belongs /u/rocknocker he posted it in an ask reddit thread. was working as an expat oil company senior staff geologist (and de facto exploration manager, but without the increase in pay nor authority, just increased stress levels) in the middle east for a southern european construction company's oil and gas concerns. the general manager was a complete cuntwat. full of himself because he worked for one major oil company his whole benighted career as an engineer, so obviously, he knows everything about geology, geophysics, petrophysics, etc. (he didn't and doesn't). his "management style" (if one could grace his screaming and infantile fuming as a 'style') could be described variously as 'inept micromanagement' or 'management by objection'. would berate and degrade the entire staff in meetings with partners (which made everyone terribly uncomfortable to see such a lack of decorum and professionality), scream so the whole office could hear over mundane idiocies such as lack of coffee pods in the kitchen or why 6,000 meters of pipe had never materialized even though the unpaid invoice still nestled on his desk. in a multicultural office, he would rant and rail, at top volume, about "useless fucking arabs", "fucking self-important and entitled expats" and "goddamn fucking jingle-bunnies (those engineers and others from the subcontinent region)". called the firm "the worst fucking oil company in the middle east" (at least, here we agreed). not only a racist, but a sexist, misogynist, general misanthrope and a complete and total waste of carbon. he got in my goodie locker one day after a well was drilled (but yet to be tested or completed) based on my prospect and recommendation, looked somewhat dismal on the logs. truth is, the well came in for over 8,000 bopd, and it was the jake-leg and lowest-bid (from whom he always took kickbacks) loggers that had fucked over the logs, and he absolutely refused my insistence to re-log the pay zones. i was called just about every nasty name in the oil patch handbook, right down to the part where he told me my alma mater were a bunch of 'fucking idiots' for granting me my three petroleum geology degrees. after 26 years in the patch, i decided that no job was worth this and laid plans for a quick, early and entirely unannounced departure. i quietly related the fact that i was doing a "runner" to some of my other expat compatriots over drinks one thursday evening and was greeted with the revelation that several (read : most) of the other expats there were 1. thinking the same thing, and 2. if i left, they were gone as well. we carefully laid our plans. the company 'provided' housing (i.e., paid a ridiculously low monthly fee so we had to live in cheap-ass housing or sucked it up with our families and ponied up additional funds to live in decent villas), so we all gave clandestine notice to our respective landlords about our imminent departure and asked they keep it on the qt. since they were paid by check (12 per year) and were already compensated, they were both delighted that they had already been paid once and that they could rent out our abodes after we left for essentially double rent. cancellation of internet, water and power were token; a quick email, print the automated response and carry it with you if the border guards gave us any shit when we buggered off. since we were all western european, canadian, or american, we decided to book a block of business class tickets (as was our contractual due) to london on the same british airways flight. in fact, with families and all, we booked the entire business class section. we all had been in-country for years and years, so arranging packing and shipping (or storage) of our belongings was a snap. we were all members of the 'move every 18 months to follow the money' crowd, so this was the easiest part of our master plan. no one leaked a word of all this, but some of the locals in the company somehow sensed the change in the decorum of the company's daily activities (when one really doesn't give a shit, the stress levels magically evaporate down to near zero) and wondered aloud what was going on. we confided in a few of them (these were not just colleagues, but personal friends in many cases) with the proviso that they would tell no one, under the pain of bacon sandwiches (they were all muslims, and they thought the threat hilarious. like i said, many were, and are still close, personal friends). the weeks dragged on and school was about to let out for the summer (when most expats bugger off for 1-3 months to escape the stupidly hot and humid middle eastern broiler season), so the usual requests for contractual time off were made (and all roundly rejected by herr mr. dickhead general manager) and life proceeded on its merry way. finally, liberation friday arrived (weekends being friday-saturday at this time in this country). we contracted a local carrier and had a bus rented to pick up everyone and take us all to the airport. luggage tagged and schlepped off to the bowels of bas incomprehensible baggage-handling inner workings; through check-in, customs, and passport control without so much as a sideways glance. we all invaded the english pub after hitting duty free one last time we toasted each other on a job well done and best soon forgotten. sitting in business class waiting on takeoff (quaffing my third double vodka and bitter lemon), i did a quick tally: the company was, in this one instance, losing its sr. staff geologist cum exploration manager, senior geophysicist, sr. petrophysicist, sr. geomodeller, sr. reservoir engineer, drilling engineer, operations geologist, logistics manager, senior surveyor, 3 secretaries (wives of the aforementioned senior crowd), and the hseq manager. a small company (total 50 or so total employees) could withstand the loss of 2 or maybe even 3 of their senior level employees, but not this mass emigration. my good friends whom we left behind regaled us for months regarding the situation in the office come sunday...bloody sunday. once the realization of what had happened, the gm went completely "off the rails", "totally shithoused" and "completely berserk", or variations on that theme. the first glimmer of recognition of the severity of the of rotund bale if jeers about to descend upon him were when all calls to various abodes were answered with "that number is no longer in service. please check blahblahblah...". emails went unanswered however our gsms were still working, although we all blocked herr dickhead's number, though we still allowed text messages. text 1: "where are you? why aren't you at work?" was just the beginning. in the words of khan noonian singh we "let him eat static". text 2: "where the fuck are you? if you don't get you asses in here immediately..." and other such impotent threats. ("yes, please. i'd love another drink.") rising panic ensued: text 3: "this isn't funny. come in and we'll act like this never happened..." we all sat on the plane, anticipating touchdown. by the time we hit london, it was 0700 local time but 1100 back-there time. herr dickhead gm called an emergency meeting of the remnants of his staff (all locals) and demanded to know what they knew about this huge display of insubordination. "dunno", "never heard a word", "why? what happened" and "where is everybody?" were the responses. herr dickhead blows a gasket and immediately sacks everyone left in the office. unfortunately, all that were left were a couple of teaboys (who are always in demand) and a bunch of locals. due to the country's "-ization" plan, it would be easier to fly a fully loaded 747 through the hole of a bagel than it would be to dispose of a local indigenous worker. long story short, he couldn't and was instantly reported to the proper ministry in charge of such matters as one of the secretaries was kin to the minister of employment affairs (it's all wasta (nepotism) in this part of the worlds). final damages: loss of 10+ senior employees. fines of over 5,000 riyals/day due to improper business practices (firing locals). loss of 2 drilling rigs due to lack of personnel and inability to provide work as per contracts; and cessation of drilling of 2 active wells (into the hole, so to speak, about us$3.5mm each) and 10 or 12 field development wells. so long cash flow. loss of a 3-d seismic contract worth approximately us$3mm. adios exploration program. loss of "a-rating", meaning you take a back seat to all who try and tender rigs, seismic crews, etc. good luck sourcing oil country tubular goods, logging or completion services and pretty much all field related activities. loss of face with several ministries (no small item here, huge importance is placed on competence and perceived amiability). au revoir field development plan acceptance or seismic contract approval. loss of 6 locals to the national oil company. figured if expats deserted this amalgamation of idiocy masquerading as an oil company, they should bail as well. ultimate temporary closure of the office, cessation of all field activities, payments of 150-200% on defaulted loans and contracts and loss of several lucrative pipeline right-of-ways and transfer contracts. they had to continue to pay the still employed locals, basically sending them a check for sitting at home playing xbox, and loss of 25% of their acreage due to non-fulfillment of contracts with the government. last i heard, herr gm dickhead is thrashing around south texas trying sell some sort of jumped-up and shady oil deals with companies who have seen their own projects quashed by plummeting oil prices. funny thing is, he keeps running into people, now on the other side of the desk, who both know him, and in one or two cases, actually worked for him. one receives a special gold-plated schadenfreude when you lean ever so slightly forward and tell him to "fuck off" and "don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out, you might suffer brain damage". tl:dr general manager at an oil company treats all his staff like shit. so we work together to cost the company millions of dollars. and cost the gm his job.i know a lot of people have been waiting for this update. **this shit gets better.** if you haven't read the original post, check it out [here]( to clear up a misconception from last time - i *did* call the police at the time of the incident, and they would not come out because it was on private property. when i left you guys last time, the police were about to serve this dude the paperwork. i had found him, and i was awaiting a phone call from the sheriff's department with a confirmation. but their phone call wasn't the best news. they arrived at the defendant's business address, and no one was at the address. the deputy told me he could try again tomorrow, but i was already not a fan of the way the police had acted until this point, so i told him to leave the paperwork at the police station, and i'll take care of it myself. i enlisted a coworker, david to serve this guy instead. i drove david to the place of business - a two story, decrepit business complex with grey stonework and 70's style brown trimming. the defendant's place of business was on the second story, in a dark corner amidst other small businesses. it was extremely quiet, and not one of the offices upstairs were occupied. david knocked on the door, with no answer. however, there was a mail slot in the middle of the door. we looked through it, and saw that the "office" was about the size of a mini cooper, with a solitary desk and a dell pc. nothing was on, and there was no phone. we called the phone number i had tried earlier, and no one answered. so we went downstairs, hoping to speak to another business owner as to the whereabouts of this guy. for some reason, the empty office gave me a really uncomfortable feeling. on the first floor was a phone repair shop, with two sales reps at the counter. david nervously asked one of them if they knew who george g****** was. the man responded - "are you here to serve him?" dave laughed and asked how he knew that. the man told him that they get people in here every week attempting to serve george g******. so this dude has been running from people for quite a while. i need to tell you here that reddit really helped in this investigation. one user, /u/rijnzael, told me about colorado's secretary of state website. i used it and found another business address for the same company. david and i drove there, but the office space was completely empty. those were the only two leads i had. i felt defeated, and without closure. the last resort i had was a user, /u/semyonov, who offered his private investigative services to me on another thread. i messaged him, and within one hour, i was on the phone with him, giving every piece of information i had about the defendant. semyonov (we'll refer to him as "p.i.") told me to give him a few hours, and he'd call me back. sure enough, within an hour, he called and went through the full background on george g******. a hispanic male in his early 40's...who has liens and judgments against him stemming all the way back from 1997. the defendant has been all over colorado since 1997, setting up at least 10-12 small businesses - all with multiple p.o. boxes. the addresses were impossible to find, and the phone numbers were bunk. one address happened to be a prison in my hometown of canon city, co, so we assumed he was a convicted felon. the multiple businesses this man set up was a telltale indicator of money laundering activity. he had filed for bankruptcy twice, but he recently sold a business in 2013 for over $600,000 - so he wasn't exactly poor. unfortunately, despite the full record p.i. pulled up, there was absolutely nothing new for us to go on. after a few back and forth phone calls from other attempts - i told p.i. that he had done his job, and that i had felt a strong sense of peace, knowing that not only have dozens of people attempted this very same thing before to no avail, but that i had exhausted every resource available to me. i went back home and relaxed for the day. 30 minutes later, my phone rings. p.i. called and told me that he tried another database, one that usually doesn't pull up many results. however, this time an address popped up for a home about 15 minutes north of me in commerce city. the home is owned by an asian couple...but the utilities are in the name of the defendant. p.i. told me that he could do surveillance of the home at an hourly fee, but i told him that i would go by and see if i found anything first. i got in my truck and drove to the address. the home was among an absolutely gorgeous neighborhood surrounding a golf course, each of them worth $500k+. i rounded the corner for the address, and two houses down - the grey dodge ram was sitting in the driveway. the license plates matching the photos i took. he was at the fucking house. i drove down to the end of the street and called p.i. i needed him served right here, right now, while we still have a chance. i met up with him at a king soopers (grocery store) about two blocks away, and he went through the game plan - he would park across the street and use his binoculars to spot george. all the p.i. needed was a visual confirmation, and the papers would be served. both the p.i. and me carry concealed, so i parked two houses down and stood on the sidewalk, as p.i. pulled across the street. as p.i.'s brakes quietly squeaked as he stopped, george came outside and started loading his truck. he was getting ready to leave somewhere. p.i. got out of his car and had his cellphone in his shirt pocket, recording the entire exchange. p.i asked "are you mr. george g******?" "no" george replied. "well, does he happen to live here?" "no, no one by that name lives here." "oh really? because i know what you look like, and your plates and vehicle match up to you." "are you profiling me, bro?!" "dude...don't pull that crap with me" george surprisingly answered - "okay" p.i. gave him the documents. we served the douchenozzle. we got him. we had his address. at this point, he has to either move to another residence, or pay the full amount in order to get out of this mess. george and i exchanged looks as he turned to walk back into his house, papers in hand. i gave him a huge smile, and i walked back to my truck. the p.i. and i met around the corner, and i left my truck running while i came up to his car to sign the paperwork and pay him for the services rendered. while i was signing - i heard my phone ring through the truck's bluetooth. i walked back and picked up my phone, with the words "private number" sitting across the screen. my adrenaline shot up, and i could feel my eyes dilate. there was absolutely no one else who would call from a private number at this time, so i picked it up while the p.i. was scrambling to begin recording on his phone. i answered - "hello?" a calm, smooth voice replied - "what's up, cracker?" i answered back with a derogatory expletive that i will not repeat. george threatened - "i'm coming to your house tonight - and i'm gonna come up on you." "oh yeah? how do you know where i live?" (i had intentionally left my address off of his copy of the service notice) "doesn't matter, you better watch your back, you pudgy-ass mother fucker" (i'm not even fat!) as i answered back, the phone hung up. the p.i. wasn't able to record the exchange, but he pointed to my dash cam - the thing that had already been quite the useful tool before - it was running the whole time, with audio to go with it. the p.i. and i parted ways, and on the way back to my house i called 911, hoping i could get him arrested. i reported the threat he had just made. i was shaken, mostly by the tone of voice george had, plus the fact that he had spent time in prison. he had nothing to lose, so why wouldn't he kill me for $1,000? the police officers were...you guessed it...unhelpful. they told me it wasn't a real threat, because he didn't specifically use key words like "gun" or "knife", or even "hurt". so they refused to come out, but i could go in on monday to request a restraining order. it was friday night, and a piece of paper wasn't gonna do much anyway. i was thankful that i was carrying at the time, and that i had more than one weapon at home. i went home and did a quick google search. if you type in my name and zip code, which was on the copy of paperwork george received, my home purchase is public fucking record. the very first result is my address. great. so i started packing my weapons into my truck, set my home video cameras to record, talked to my neighbors, had my roommate go to her friend's house for the weekend, and left. i met up with the p.i., who attempted several times to get the police to come out and at least file a report, to no avail. after waiting for a while, i went to my girlfriend's house and stayed there for the weekend, periodically logging in to my cameras from my tablet and checking on the house. fortunately, he didn't show up, and my neighbors didn't report a grey ram driving around the area. i laid low for the next three weeks. my bumper got fixed, and this morning, i walked into the courtroom with my pages of pertinent documents, videos, and audio recordings, and waited. george didn't show up, and the (surprisingly, very rude) judge ruled in my favor by default, for a total of $1,067.88. my next step is to have p.i. go back and serve him with interrogatories - a piece of paper which has him declare any assets, his banking accounts, etc. if he is served the interrogatories, and he does not comply, a bench warrant is issued for his arrest. throughout this whole time, george hasn't done anything illegal, technically. colorado driving laws state that insurance is not required on private property, which the home depot parking lot is. so i'm hoping to get these papers served, and get a criminal charge against him. if i don't, it's really not a big deal. i got under his skin enough that he had to call and threaten me, and that makes me a happy man. seriously, thank you all for the advice and well wishes. this was a great ride, and it would be awesome if a local newspaper could pick this up. i reached out to 9news and fox 31 denver a few weeks ago, and neither have replied. i highly recommend /u/semyonov's services, he's an incredible p.i. with a ton of patience and understanding, and is very good at walking you through the entire process. any fucking questions?there's a disabled man (cerebral palsy) that lived in my town up until recently who uses his disability to make his living. he sued several local businesses for ada violations, even if he never bothered to enter the some of the stores. some settled their suits and paid him a nuisance settlement with an agreement for him not to come back, other smaller businesses just closed their doors and everyone was out of work. he sued the business i work for, even though it was a new location and completely inspected and certified as ada accessible by the state. we decided to fight him to the bitter end. early on, we counter sued for our costs in the event we prevailed which is a common practice in cases like this. the case got nasty; he'd come in ranting, cursing, and literally screaming at me, all a part of trying to provoke me into saying something that would help his case while he was video recording the encounters. throughout the ordeal, he had an almost sociopathic attitude and we finally trespass warned him from the property. that didn't stop him from coming in and he wound up going to jail twice for trespassing. the case continued and we finally went into depositions where our lawyer ripped his case to shreds. he freely admitted he had sued us wanting a settlement and didn't expect us to fight him. the case continued to progress through time until we finally filed a motion for summary judgement. we won. the case was thrown out and we were awarded a judgement for our costs (which were covered by our insurance) totaling $85,000. the revenge: he moved to a nearby town where he continues suing businesses. i set up a google news alert for his name. he sued another business, the regional paper picked it up in their "legal briefs" column. i got the email and wasted no time calling my attorney and then the defendant involved to offer my help. here's how we worked it: our attorney filed a motion to assume his case using our judgement as a vested interest in the outcome of his case. the court agreed and we took his case over, and then immediately settled it for $10. there wasn't a damn thing he or his shit-house lawyer could do about it. he can expect this 8,499 more times before we quit, and i'm determined to follow through with it. it brings me joy to put effort into ruining his little shit game.so this story is from quite a while ago, in one of those endangered white rhinos of the retail world, a chain video store. my chain store had a lot of management turnover, as well as "franchise turnover" (meaning we were passed between a couple of franchise groups before landing somewhere in limbo). this, along with the fact that all of the employees knew the management login and password meant that we had more power than we should have, and little to no threat of firing or legal repercussions (i remember a kid lifting and selling a bunch of new releases of lotr1 before the official release date). now, being a "family place" (the 2nd biggest national chain), and being the store with the biggest selection in an area of upper-middle-class suburbs/towns, we had a lot of issues with entitled mombies and kids, but this was one of my favorites. there were 2 of us manning the counter, so i stepped out and started asking customers if they needed help finding anything. there was a mother with 4 kids, the youngest being a toddler in diapers, wandering around the video game section. i asked if they needed help, and was given something of a harrumph/sigh in response. lacking a translation for "frumpy groan," i simply said i was around and if they needed help just holler. i noticed the toddler was tugging on his diapers and doing a duck walk, but being 20 and not experienced with kids, i wasn't aware just what that signified. note that she never asked to use the restroom, or indicated that there was an issue. i did the rest of my rounds and returned to the video game aisle, where i noticed what looked like a trail of chocolate covered raisins leading to the toddler. thinking the little shit had helped himself to our treats (which were stupidly in reach of grubbey little shits), i looked for the box, only to see another round one drop from the groin-goblin's leg. i was a bit shocked with that, but then he started pulling at his diaper, dropping more and more while mom is ignoring his whimpers and waiting in line. i walk up behind her, poke her shoulder and ask if she would like some rags, a bag, and cleaner to take care of her little shit monster, and she replies that it isn't her job, and isn't that what we are getting paid for? now, she is 3 spots back in the line, so i tell her that i can help her out on my register. i scan her card, and promptly note on her account that her kid had shit allover the floor, and that their account was permanently disabled. i told her that the system wasn't taking that card, and asked if there was another account for their family (there was one for their teen, and one for the husband.) i got the phone number and looked up the other accounts, repeating the same note to all of them, and using the manager code to mark all of their (quite substantial) late fees as "to be sent to collections." i then smiled, and cut the card up in front of her, and told her that since she can't respect the store or the employees, and since she is unable to control her children, and refused to clean up after them, that she her accounts were locked and that she was banned. she tried to use the other accounts, but i told her they were irreparably locked too, and that her household was flagged so they couldn't get any new cards. she flew off the handle, screaming and shouting, yelling that cleaning the floors there wasn't her job (it is when your panty-stain decides to shit all over it), and that she would call the manager, owner or corporate and report me. i told her to go ahead, nothing would happen to us. she grabbed her kid (still dropping nuggets) and screamed for the rest of her brood, loading them into the van and peeling out of the parking lot with her middle finger raised. she called back that night asking for a manager, and i had a real fun time pretending to be chuck, the territorial manager (not a real person). i told her she and her family were banned from any stores in the district, and that we would be pressing charges if her or any of her family tried to open up a new account. i ended up having to clean up the shit, which sucked, so i called up the other video store in the town and let them know what had happened (or that they were habitual shop lifters, i can't remember) but they ended up banned from there. they tried coming in and renting a few times, even trying to set up new accounts, but each time they were flagged, both because the incident and their late fees (which i guess they couldn't pay off now that the account was locked, and they were sent to collections for them, but i have no sympathy). they ended up getting sent to collections and having a lot of issues due to that, and tried to call and write the store to make impotent legal threats, but i had made sure to put notes up on the desk and the system. they came into another job i was working a year or two later and started yelling at me, asking why i ruined their lives. i told them the truth, it was because their actions in the video store were reprehensible, and that we didn't need customers like that. i also said that if they returned their videos on time they wouldn't have had fees, and then they wouldn't have gone to collections. i suggested that they perhaps learn from this experience, and readdress how they treat retail employees. this just further enraged them (the husband was in my face). they were asked to leave, and "banned" from there as well. seriously though, if she would have even apologized i would have let it go, but having to clean up her kid's shit and deal with her attitude? that (in my mind at least) justified the repercussions. tl;dr: mombie lets loin-goblin shit all over my video store and cops an attitude, and the family gets banned and gets their credit corn-holed as a result.so my wife and i live in an old victorian style house in a college town split into two apartments - our 2 bedroom downstairs, and a 4 bedroom upstairs. the first year it was occupied by nursing students, who were great. they all finished their rotations and moved out, and we got a set of mba students who were douches. at first we thought "oh they're young, we'll politely complain when they don't clean up their dog crap/have a tuesday night kegger/play cod so loud it rattles our windows, they'll figure it out and it will be ok. well, it wasn't. their response to our requests were annoyance and non-compliance, which opened the door up for me to engage is passive - aggressive revenge tactics, and i have many stories from the year they resided above us. one monday morning, after a pretty raging party upstairs i came outside to find my car parked in by the upstairs neighbor my wife had nicknamed cunthammer (ch for short). now in the lease we had exclusive use of the driveway, upstairs were supposed to park on the street - however they often parked behind us when street parking was scarce. so i knocked on the door to get them to move the car so i could go to work. only there's a problem - ch has left that morning on spring break vacation. he won't be back for two weeks. after i had recovered from contemplating exactly how much of a syphilis ridden wanksock of a human being you would have to be to illegally park in your downstairs neighbor and then leave for two weeks, i rang the non emergency police line and explained my situation. they tried to contact ch, to no avail, so my legal recourse was to have the car towed to a legal, vacant spot on the street at my own expense. which, given i had to go to work, was what i would have to do. while i was waiting for the tow truck, i hatched a mature, and a juvenile revenge plan. juvenile plan first, i got a bottle of dot3 brake fluid and a rag out, and utilizing the extent of my artistic abilities, painted a big old cock and balls on the hood, with a pew pew pew of pee going over the roof, and left it to bake in. the mature part of the plan came to fruition when the tow truck arrived. our city has a penchant for street sweeping, and tow cars enthusiastically when doing so. they had just put up signs down one side of our street notifying that they would be sweeping in four days. i reserved a spot that side of the road for ch's car, and had the driver put it there. i let him in on the plan, as he was contracted to tow cars for the city that day. he giggled a lot at my slowly emerging cocknballs artwork, and said he'd try and pick up ch's car early, knowing that if he was away for two weeks, his company would be able to rack up a nice storage fee. the day came, and the tow driver who moved the car came straight to ch's car and towed it. i had dropped a note in ch's letterbox explaining, without being rude, that he had parked me in, and i had to have his car moved, at my expense so i could go to work. cue him coming back and furiously pounding on my door. "where's my fucking car?" he demanded. i explained i had moved it to the other side of the street, into a legal car space because neither the police or i could contact him. the city had swept the street last thursday. they had towed it. he'd need to call the city. he stormed off, furious, only to return a few hours later. apparently the combination of the city's fine, the tow fee and ten days storage totaled over $1,000. and his car had been (hilariously) vandalized at the tow yard. he demanded i pay. i politely declined - suggesting that he might try small claims court if he could demonstrate i'd done anything i was liable for. he never took me up on the offer. the artwork had come out great - the car had been left in the rain so the giant dick on the hood of his beat up civic had rusted in. apparently it even earned him the nickname dickwheels in class. this one dates back a way to the late 1990s. a friend of mine had a small flat as accommodation, partly subsidised by the university he studied at. there were about 20 flats at this location, and they were built in pairs, so everyone shared a wall and roof with their neighbour. my friend's neighbour was a mess of a kid i'll call m who came into second year uni having barely scraped through the first and spent just about all his available time with loud music, smoking, and getting drunk with friends over. the flats were *tiny*, but m still managed to cram in half a dozen people several nights a week, and the stereo jacked up high with bullshit music and bass far too high. my friend's complaints about it fell on deaf ears. he tried talking to m who promised to turn it down, did so for a minute or two, then turned it up again. m stopped answering his door when my friend knocked. he confronted m in the car park and asked again, and m dismissed my friend's complaints with "it's just fuckin' music mate" and went on his way. police said everyone at the campus needed to learn to get along and did nothing but talk, and the university itself was tied up with bureaucracy and nothing ever came of his complaints to housing admin. so we took things into our own hands. the roof cavity shared between the two flats had only one access hole, in my friend's bathroom. we dragged a subwoofer up there and hung it from the rafters over the top of the main room in m's flat, and connected it to my friend's pc with a soundboard app of music with heavy bass. first time round it worked a treat, and we were careful not to go overboard in case m found what we were doing. m would turn the music up, we'd soundboard it with more music on top, and the stereo would go down again while he listened for what was making the extra noise, and it gave a tiny bit of relief. m didn't stop with the music bullshit, but knowing we could really annoy him back was a little victory. then another of our friends suggested something absolutely genius. he helped rig up a microphone epoxied to the ceiling plaster in the cavity directly above m's stereo. the mic fed into the pc, which recorded the sound from m's house, applied a delay, and fed the bass back to the hidden subwoofer. just a couple of seconds did the trick to make the music unbearable. whenever m turned his music up, the sub would kick in and play back a little of m's own music on loop, stop, then listen again for more. the first night we had it going was fine tuning, the second was absolutely perfect. one and a half seconds delay was *killer*. we sat in our friend's flat listening to m's stereo go up and down up and down in the middle of one of his parties until he got so pissed off at it that he and his friends left and took their party elsewhere. two nights later, same thing. m had his music up and we let it run clean, then as soon as more people arrived to his flat, on came the subwoofer and delay and m had a temper tantrum we thought would end them all. a couple weeks later, m was home by himself and had the stereo up again for an afternoon trying to diagnose the problem, and with delay after delay after delay he completely *lost* it. he had an epic temper tantrum to beat the last one and screamed, broke furniture, and smashed up his own walls. one simple report to housing admin that he was physically damaging the place and the bureaucratic cloud lifted, and they came down on him &amp; he was kicked out. from start to finish it took just over four weeks to get rid of him. the next neighbour was a pretty sensible guy with no overbearing insistence that his music was what everyone else had to listen to, and got on well with my friend. mission accomplished, and all that.obligatory long time, first time. please excuse any formatting errors, i am on mobile. this is a tale of elementary school pro revenge. i was in fifth grade, and i will be frank with you, no one liked me. i was chubby and socially inept. this revenge begins with myself and a classmate we will call jimmy. jimmy didn't like me. he made a sport of harassing me, and i being the delicate ten year old flower i was, was naturally distraught on account of his behavior. he would exclude me from activities and lunch groups, but the final straw was on valentine's day. jimmy enacted a diabolical plot, and i did not receive a single valentine in my shoebox. i was crushed. after the valentine snub he made sure he rubbed salt in my wound by asking to see my valentines and then laughing when i said i didn't have any. i wasn't about to take that sort of cruelty lying down, so i hatched a plot. i spent days and days talking up this new candy type breath spray i had. i went on and on about how delicious it was, and how my dad got it abroad and you couldn't get it here. of course jimmy was intrigued and asked to sample it. i declined, and explained that it was so special and rare that i just couldn't spare any. one day before lunch i was talking about how delicious it was and could see the hunger in little jimmy's eyes. i pulled my bottle of glasses cleaner out of my backpack and slipped in my desk all fake sneaky like. i knew he had seen it. it was about ten minutes after this that my plan came to fruition. i was walking down the hall and heard a hullabaloo of sorts, so being a curious young lass, i asked what the fuss was about. turns out jimmy had snuck into my desk and drank my glasses cleaner, and by the time he realized his horrible mistake he had swallowed enough to make himself quite ill. an ambulance was called and that little bastard never bothered me again. as a side note: as an adult, i now realize how dangerous this was. tl;dr- a kid bullied me so i poisoned him.so a few weeks back i sort of got a 2 for 1 deal on revenge, but to explain how i need to give a little backstory. the first asshole i met in college. asshole classmate. he was in my major. he was the laziest asshole ever. our department was lacking students so they allowed him into the program to avoid budget cuts. anyone unfortunate enough to get stuck with asshole classmate on a group project was pretty much doomed to do the whole project themselves. it was a project built for a group of people to complete in a month. being in his group was an automatic c. he never did work, and in my case, managed to lose all of our work after taking it home to copy it. despite contributing literally nothing, he felt entitled to put his name on the project, and display it in his portfolio. if he wasn't allowed to get his way, (we stopped letting him sign his name on our projects, he failed senior and junior year), he badmouthed you and threatened to call all of your future employers. my senior year at that school i got a job in my field. it was honestly just a crappy job that was marginally better than the unpaid externships we're expected to do. i had a crappy boss, asshole boss. he had me do all the dumb office stuff like make him coffee, and complain that i was bad at it (i don't drink coffee). he was the typical spoiled brat son inheriting a company from his dad. he was fond of reminding me that if he knew how to use the software and the tools i did, he could also do my job, and that he was learning how so that he could get rid of my position. to the revenge. i'm out of school, i got a much better job offer, so i politely told him to go eat a dick. of course i got fired for insubordination, but i get that sweet unemployment pay until my next job kicks in. he fired me at an inconvenient time for his company. their biggest company is expecting prototypes from us. four of them. no one knows how to do them aside from me. their customer will be there in three weeks. in a panic, nice supervisor asks if i know anyone that can do job. i check facebook, asshole classmate is still unemployed. i tell him to apply. he thanks me profusely. nice supervisor thanks me profusely. asshole classmate goes to interview with asshole boss, proceeds to badmouth me. claims he carried me the whole way in college. i check his online portfolio, my projects are on there with my watermark still on them. asshole boss hires him. their customer comes in one week from today. nothing has been done. asshole classmate calls in sick too much. nice supervisor calls me to tell me she is quitting because asshole boss is taking out his anger on everyone. asshole classmate complains that no one appreciates him. that customer has been waiting for that prototype for 3 months. he is over 70% of their current business, and is not happy with them. they will possibly go out of business because of this. also, i got my friend who is an attorney to send asshole classmate a cease and desist letter to take my work off of his portfolio. i posted that letter as well as screenshots of him stealing my work on our field's professional network. good luck getting a job now.last year i moved to a new town, partially since me and my brothers obtained a full scholarship for a upper-crusty highschool. we'd never been in a brick and mortar school before (homeschooled) and i wanted to make it work. i transitioned pretty well, but one of my brothers was having some trouble with a grade 11, josh. josh was dumber than a hammer, rippling with apelike muscles, possessing a grand overall of 62% in his courses. he was 5'8, a professional wrestler who was in the nationals, known for being a sadistic motherfucker that would hurt opponents accidentally-on-purpose. looked like he was on steroids, too. anyways, he tried to insult my brother, and he stood up for himself, even though he was in 9th grade. he got thrown headfirst into a locker and put into a chokehold. josh didn't get into much trouble, but he got a stern talking to. turns out that when you're in a private school like that, as long as you pay the tuition they aren't going to do much. i was incredibly pissed off, but i didn't do anything rash. i couldn't take this guy with a knife, plus i'd get in serious trouble, so i waited... 1 year later, when we were in 10th grade, i was talking to one of my best friends. he was a wrestler, and when we were talking he brought up how josh had made a 12 year old girl give him a blowjob, filmed it, and showed it off to the whole wrestling team a year ago. motherfucker smiled to the camera too. josh was 17 at the time... i had found exactly what i needed. josh had graduated a year ago, which meant that he was 18. i convinced my friend to talk to the teachers, so we did. they contacted the police and child services. word had been getting around, so more and more witnesses started to talk about what had happened. it must've been a testament to josh's unpopularity that word hadn't gotten to him. the police searched his house, found his computer and phone. he had cp, i don't know how much but it was more than enough to get him thrown into prison (don't know how long either). they found the girl in the video and she wanted to press charges, too. double whammy. he's now banned from our school, the job offer that he could've had as a coach at our school is gone now, and his former coach talked to every wrestling program in the province about him. his career as a wrestler is completely over, and with a gpa that bad, he certainly isn't getting anywhere in his life now. i know it was all because of me. if i hadn't made my friend talk to someone, him and all the other witnesses who had seen the video would never spoken up. the funny thing is, i don't care that i ruined his life. i'm happy. you don't fuck with my brother and get away with it. enjoy prison, douchebag.**background:** growing up, i lived with my parents in a three bedroom condo unit on the second floor. there was only three condos in a unit so we had only one apartment above us and one below us. the unit is apart of a few blocks worth of condominiums and it's like its own little community. all the neighbors know each other and were always around to offer a helping hand. it was an awesome quiet little nook filled with families in what was otherwise a very busy part of a large city. my parents still live there after 25 years since they bought the place when they first immigrated to america. my parents are for the most part very friendly people, and had good relations with all our neighbors. below us lived a nice eastern european family and above us, a large asian family who despite the sheer amount of people living there, we never heard a peep from them. they were all on friendly terms, but it was very much a situation of 'i won't bother you so don't bother me.' my entire childhood, there was never any bad blood between any of the neighbors and for the most part everyone just did their own thing and lent a helping hand once in awhile. as a side note: my father worked in construction since he was a young kid, and building codes are essentially his bread and butter. within the department of buildings and fire department in my state, he cultivated a reputation over the past 30 years as being one of the foremost experts in understanding building codes and spotting potential issues on any job site instantly. this is important to remember. **now on to the story:** the trouble didn't start until about 12 years after my parents moved in, and the nice large asian family living in the unit above us decided to move out and sold the property. the new owners did a full renovation of the apartment. what they failed to do was properly insulate the floors again. which meant we heard every step, every little noise this family made at all hours of the day. seriously, it was bad, especially when you're trying to sleep in only to be woken what sounds like a rolling bowling ball on the floor at 6am on a sunday. when this problem first occurred, my father went and spoke to the owner. he explained how by not adding insulation was a violation of several building codes and also a direct violation of the condominium contract they signed that stated that insulation in floors and wall is a must. this asshole owner (ao) pretended not to speak english, even though we constantly heard him yelling in english on the phone. my dad was quick to call him out on it, and when ao was caught, he started yelling in asian accented broken english that he couldn't understand him, and that my dad needs to learn english. now, english is not my dad's first language, or even his third. he taught himself when he first came to america and got a job as a bellhop in a fancy hotel by reading newspapers. he has a heavy eastern european accent but you can easily understand him and he's comfortable enough to hold a long conversation with someone in english. to hear this man yelling at him to learn english was not only rude, but downright insulting. ao did this every time my dad tried to approach him about it during the time of his renovation to change the floors. after six months, there were no more contractors coming into the unit, and it was clear that ao had no intention of fixing the floors. my dad tried one more time and got the exact same response from ao, my dad said, "fuck you, i'll see you in court." i don't remember the exact way of how things were done, but i know my dad got a building inspector to see the place, and they were issued at least a few fines for violations but still refused to fix the floors. my dad then took them to court, using a decibel meter to measure how loud the sounds from their apartment were to us. this trial lasted two years before the judge issued them a court order to fix the floors and ordered them to pay a set amount to my dad. again, ao paid the money to my father but after six months, still didn't fix the floor. in fact, in those six months it was louder than ever. it felt like they were purposely walking louder, running, and moving furniture at all hours of the day. i had taken to sleeping with music on to block out the noise. my father had enough. it was then he decided to take things into his own hands. he placed some orders on the phone, and got my uncles together. one morning they came back with huge boxes from the electronics store. they used the money from the court settlement to buy several thousand dollars of those heavy bass speakers you see in clubs and in stadiums. now remember, my father knows his stuff after years and years of both working on construction sites and working as an engineer. for the next three days, my father and my uncles all strategically cut holes in our ceilings, one hole in every room in the house. they would mount a speaker inside, do the wiring, and then strategically insulate it so they could direct the sound. then they patched the holes right up as if there was never a hole there to begin with. that very night they finished all the work, we were relaxing in the living room, watching a movie when the stomping and running starting. my dad casually leaned over to our stereo system and turned it on. i saw him fiddling with it for a moment before he turned the volume up all the way. faintly from our ceiling came the sounds of cotton eye joe. we could just barely hear it with the television on inside, but when you stepped onto the balcony that was directly below the balcony of the people living upstairs, it sounded like they were blasting music from their apartment. my father played that song on repeat for over an hour and well into the night. they stomped angrily on the floor for a good while, but still that song played on. they banged on our door, which my father answered and yelled at him for playing the music. he just opened his door wider so all you heard was a loud tv and my dad said "you guys are the ones making the noise," and closed the door in his face. for the next year, whenever the neighbors were running or stomping around, my dad would blare cotton eye joe on full repeat. they called the cops on us a few times, but my dad would just turn off the music and show the cops the court document that stated it was the neighbors with the noise violations. after about two times the cops never came again. ao moved out after a year and a half enduring "cotton eye joe". the place stood empty for awhile, until my dad found out that ao decided to rent the place out without fixing the floors again. for the next few years, that place must have gone through at least eight different people renting it. my dad always spoke with the renters before they moved in and explained the court order on the apartment on the noise level. whenever they got noisy, my dad had no problem blaring "cotton eye joe" on full blast. a few months ago, the unit went on the market. real estate agents had to disclose that there was a court order on fixing the floors in this apartment. two days ago, my father closed on the upstairs unit, at almost half the cost of the original listing price. tl;dr where did he come from? where did he go? where did he come from, cotton eye joe. **edit:** i just spoke to my sister and she reminded me of how at one point we heard them ripping up the floors to look for the source of the noise. because of they way the insulation was placed they could never find exactly where the speaker was located. i remember they looked for it for a good while and then right after the construction noises stopped was when we came home to find a moving truck outside. **edit2**: my dad is getting a kick out of your comments. he wanted me to tell anyone who is thinking of following his example is to put the speakers in an insulated wooden box with the speaker side facing up, and then line the insulation a few feet around the speaker. this is supposed to direct the sound so that its coming from several directions at once. and he answered some additional questions for me. he did approach the board about it before the lawsuit but they told him they can't do anything about it because it was a private matter and was only effecting him and not the everyone. also, ao was responsible for a lot of his legal fees so my dad did not lose much money on this whole thing. let me just start this story off by saying that the guy who did this apparently has a long history of doing similar things and just generally being a dick, although i didn't know this at the time. so this has been a long time coming to him. earlier this year, i got an innocent friend request from a guy named nick over facebook. he didn't seem familiar to me, but we had a dozen friends in common, so i figured i'd probably met him online somewhere and just didn't remember exactly where from. it wasn't so bad at first; he didn't really comment on any of my posts, nor did he send me pms, and so i quickly forgot about him. a couple of months later, i make a completely innocuous post on facebook, the topic of which escapes my memory - but let me assure you that it was completely benign, and was not insulting or dramatic at all, in any way. one of my online female friends, amber, responds. and then nick starts commenting, too, which i think nothing of at first. but then amber has the audacity to disagree with him, and that's where the shitposting begins. within seconds, i was getting hundreds of notifications from that post, all from nick. in response to my friend amber cordially disagreeing with him, he decided to start spamming. i quickly butt in and very politely (#canadianproblems) asked him to please stop spamming my wall. his response was then to stop spamming letters, and to start spamming pictures of his dick instead. i was trying to delete them, but he was posting them faster than i could delete, so i, *once again*, politely asked him to stop spamming dick pics on my post, because i had real life friends and family members on my facebook account, including my mom, my dad, my brother, my opa, and all of my cousins, aunts, and uncles on both sides of my family. for some reason, he took this as a challenge, and started spamming pictures of his dick onto *every single post on my facebook wall*. at this point i had gotten pretty tired of asking nicely, so i just deleted him off facebook, and sighed heavily as i proceeded to spend the next fifteen minutes cleaning up my wall. it took him approximately 0.03921 seconds to begin spamming his cock via private message instead. i asked him once to stop; he kept going. having realized by now that he was not going to stop, i then blocked him. problem solved. *nope!* within minutes, i am receiving dozens of dick pics from multiple other obviously fake facebook accounts, from the exact same guy. i block all of them, but they just keep coming - at one point i counted that he had over twenty alternate accounts, probably for the express purpose of harassing women over facebook, as i was to learn later. this went on for weeks. every now and then, after believing that i'd blocked all of his accounts, he would send me another message, or i would get a friend request from someone who i thought i knew, and it would start all over again. it even got to the point where he had managed to track me down on some other websites, and was sending me dick pictures on them, too. (i naively use the same username for everything. i should probably fix that.) one innocent day, i logged on facebook, and bam. there he was again. dick pics in my inbox. something finally snapped in me and i said, "fuck it. if he wants to play this game, then i'm going to do it better." i unblocked him on his main facebook account. he noticed within a couple of hours, and started sending me pictures again. i very clearly told him, "i'm going to give you one more chance to stop. if you don't, then know that you are responsible for what i do next." another dick pic. okay, then. here we go. i casually peruse his facebook profile. within minutes, i spot the information i'm looking for. the first thing i do is type up a very polite and 'concerned' message about nick's appalling behavior to his lovely sister and adoring mother. did they know that their brother/son was in the habit of sending pictures of his meat and two veg to random women on facebook against their will? could they, perhaps, talk to him for me? i'm at my wits end, i just don't know what else to *do*. i'm just a nice canadian girl, i don't know how to handle this sort of thing! just for good measure, i also include a screenshot of some of his many, many pictures. the second thing i do is take a peek at his place of employment, and the city that he lives in. i put the information through on google and find that there are only two locations of the restaurant he works at in the area where he lives. okay, good, so he must work at one of these two places. it's 11:00 am, and i'm not doing anything else; i start calling. i tell my sad, sad story of harassment to the managers. could they maybe help me locate him? one of the managers, coincidentally, happens to not only be his manager, but also the mother of his best friend. she is completely disgusted when she hears what i have to say, and promises to speak with him about it. the third thing that i do, just for good measure, is tell him everything that i've just done. just because i wanted to watch him squirm. at first, he arrogantly asserts that i must be bluffing; he believes that he's hidden his tracks well enough to avoid being tracked down. he confidently demands that i tell him the names of his mother and sister to prove that i'm telling the truth. so, i do. and his phone number. and his address. and his place of employment. a lengthy lapse in the conversation occurs. understandable, of course; he needs time to process. less confidently, he begins trying to convince me that his sister and mother don't care, so i should go ahead and do it anyway so that they can all have a big laugh about it later. i'm not convinced - his sister's facebook is full of posts about church and god's love; i seriously doubt that she is the type of person who would approve of sending photographs of your genitals to unsuspecting strangers over the internet with the intent to harass them. i tell him that i've already done it, so i guess we'll find out soon enough if he's right. he writes one more half-sneering, half-terrified-out-of-his-wits message, and then logs off. game. set. match. i win. --- following this comment is a series of screenshots that i took to prove that my story is true. the best/worst part of all of this is that his sister actually responded to me - and shockingly, *this was not the first time he had done this*. i also spoke to a mutual friend of ours about him, who told me that a girl that we all used to know had accused him of attempting to rape her while she was passed out drunk on his couch. she never had him charged or anything, but i found out later that he was well-known in our group of acquaintances for being somebody who regularly harassed and assaulted women, and even occasionally men. **trigger warning: explicit photographs of male genitals in the link.** edit: if you have a question about the veracity of this post, please try reading the comments, because there is a fairly high chance that i already addresses that specific concern at some point! thank you! i am super getting tired of people making the same accusations at me that i've already answered four times in other comments. edit #2: if you require more proof, please pm me personally about it. [i do have more screenshots, i just decided to take them down off here because i think people were able to track him down using the information in them, and i don't really want to doxx him.]a summer's afternoon i found myself in the rafters of a warehouse meticulously spacing out zip ties at 3' each (92cm) running cat5e cables capped off with shielded rj45 ends. i am a man who is very particular about his wiring and this day was no different. by this time i was about 6 days into the job and my big bundle of 48 cables was almost done. the veins of my network were spread throughout the building and everything was beautifully measured off and bundled together in a trunk of cables held together by velcro binders and color coded zip ties. all in all i had spent over $3000 worth of time in this project and well over $5000 worth of equipment. the day came to collect payment. the payroll person wasn't there so i dropped off the bill on her desk. 1 day passes. 2. almost a week before i call them and ask them about it and they give me the run around. i did it as professionally as possible. i emailed, i called, i left messages and nothing. the bill was sitting at $3500. i thanked my providence to have had them pay for the equipment before i installed everything. 3 weeks flew by and they stopped answering my calls specifically and my emails. it was time. i sent them an email telling them that at the 30 day mark, as per our agreement of non-payment the bill would have a late fee of 25% and i would shut down their server. early on the 30th day, i logged into their server and changed the passwords and set it to shut down. i had a bios password so there was no way they were going to have someone else come and reset the server, they'd lose everything. all of their data from the last 5 years was locked onto that server and i waited. at 8:00am the next day i got a frantic call from the owner telling me something was wrong. i asked him to check his email and he told me that he read it but that they needed the server back on. they were "losing so much money." so i went over and walked inside and was greeted with disingenuous smiles and fake hellos. the owner talked to me about pleasantries and started leading me to the server. i asked him if he was serious and that i wasn't doing anything until i got paid for the job + the late fee. that's when everything kind of went to hell. the owner got really upset and started trying to string together something coherent and eventually just got up in an angry huff and proceeded to have the payroll person type me up a check. i took the check and left directly to their bank to cash it after telling them i'd be back in an hour or so. i took the money and banked it at my bank. once i got back i forgave them for trying to guess passwords of the bios and logged back into the server and started everything running. i billed them for my time and got payment before i left. i never heard from them again. this happened 6 years ago, but i was thinking about it yesterday and decided to write it now. so once upon a time i was married. it was a good relationship for the most part. good communication and seldom any arguing. over time my wife meets a guy, let's call him dan. dan, on the surface, seemed like a cool dude. he and my wife worked together and seemed very close. i didn't really care, they were co-workers. everybody has that co-worker they're close to, right? over time, i sense that dan and my wife are getting too close. she texted him constantly and i started getting suspicious, but i didn't want to say anything because i didn't want to come off as jealous. one night i snooped through her phone and found some explicit texts she sent to dan. it basically confirmed that a) she was cheating on me, and b) she wanted to leave me for him. even though i was pissed off that she cheated on me, i also wanted to get out of this marriage asap. the next day i sat her down and told her i knew everything. there was a lot of tears on both sides and denying on her side but she finally confessed her affair. she basically told me that she loves him and not me. we agreed that we would get divorced amicably. no alimony and whatever was ours before the marriage is ours after it. it was a very quick divorce. now, as much as i wanted to kick the shit out of dan, i didn't want to risk going to jail. at this point, they were in a relationship living together. considering she has known him for less than a year at that point, i knew things were going to end badly. a couple of months after the divorce i moved to the west coast. i had no communication with my ex from then until a month ago. she messaged me on facebook and told me she was sorry for how she treated me and that she's miserable and misses me. i decided to look through her profile. she's married to dan, has 3 kids with him and they're both horrendously fat. apparently soon after they moved in together she became pregnant with his kid. she had to quit her job because of the pregnancy and since then hasn't had a job. they got married while she was still pregnant and had 2 more kids. they're living off food stamps and government aid too. at that point i felt vindicated. i wanted to get revenge on her and dan for so long. to see they fucked up their own lives so bad was good enough.when i was younger (think ~15) i was the family it guy. still am actually. back then i used to help countless people free of charge, due to my mother whoring me out for her friends and co workers. i did not like it but i had little say about things. honestly it was a minor annoyance most of them were pretty cool people and appreciative of my help. the biggest thing that annoyed me was my mother volunteering me when i had other plans. i did it until the fateful day i dealt with "harpy". harpy was one of those late middle aged bitter as shit women you find every so often not one positive thing came out of her mouth. i honestly have no idea why my mom wanted me to help her. she brought me her computer loaded with viruses and malware. when she dropped it off the only thing she said to me was "fix it" no thank you no description of the problem nada. so i get all the malware cleaned off viruses removed get it going again i almost had to completely wipe it and reinstall windows it was so bad. i give it to my mom to drop off to harpy. about a month later harpy complained to my mother that i had broken her computer and it did not work right. so my mother brings it back home. i look at the computer and figure out what happened. the idiot woman reset all her icons to arrange by name by accident.(fyi if your getting free help don't try to cover your own incompetence with "it's your fault you touched it and it broke because of you") when i originally got the thing was so infected with malware and viruses it barely boot up. lucky for me i had a backup. i kept a rolling backup of all the computers i worked on before i touched anything for 5 computers just in case shit like this happened. i restored all the viruses and malware.told my mom give your friend back her computer its just like it was when you gave it to me last time. the next day i got a call from the harpy literally screaming and cursing at me telling me "your was an idiot s&amp;*t kid who does not know computers. how dare you break my f&amp;%#ing computer" ect. ect. fortunately we had an old fashioned answering machine i picked up the same time as the machine it got everything. that was that i had had enough. i took the bus to my mothers work she came rushing out thinking something horrible had happened and i played the recording for her. when it finished i told my mother from now on its 30 bucks an hour with 2 hours upfront. or i'm not touching a damned thing. she took it and whenever one of her friends asked for free pc work she played the recording for them. saying that's why i won't help anyone for free anymore. word got around the office that not only had harpy screamed at their co-workers kid but cost everyone their free personal slave. the pro part comes in about a year later. my mothers boss asked my mother if i was still fixing peoples computers she said yes. he wanted to hire me part time over the summer to help out the regular it guy and wanted to set up an interview. my mom told me. i called the guy up and we set up a time. the interview went really really well but i did not want to work with the harpy who screamed at me. i asked him if harpy still worked there he said "yes she does do you know her?" i told him i did know her and i cant take the job due to an event that happened about a year ago. he of course asked what happened i said "i really don't want to get into it but he could ask my mom she can give him details." come home told mom how the interview went and she still had that tape i could hardly believe it. about 2 months later harpy got the axe. apparently she was sweet as could be to the boss and a complete bitch to everyone else. the tape was enough to get the boss to start looking real close at everything she did. my mom still reels at how fast harpy got written up for shit she had pulled for years. tldr: got whored out as a free it guy as a kid so i got an old crone fired. edit: if you find any mistakes please feel free to message me english was never my best class i would be more than happy to change things for grammars sake, sorry in advance. edit 2: a couple words thanks guy's. this happened a few years ago but is honestly a very proud moment for me. so i'm driving home from my parents house and it's about 530-6 oclock in the evening on a beautiful summer night. they live in a small quiet suburb and i'm only a few towns over so the drive is usually pretty nice and peaceful. however these towns tend to breed entitled pricks and bored teenagers. i must have ran into the hybrid of the two. as i was making my way down a 25mph (i was going about 30) road toward the center of my parents town, i see one of those small honda hatchbacks in my rear view that is really low to ground and decked out with all kinds of stupid shit. he's comin in hot and i'm thinking he's going to blow by me or something. nope, just gets right on my ass and at one point i'm pretty sure he even tapped my bumper. i can see the stupid smirks on the faces of the driver and passenger. we come to a stop sign and i do my best to do a full. complete. stop. i reach over, pull out a cigarette, light it, and enjoy a drag before i start to move again. must have taken at least 10 seconds. may not seem like a lot but next time you're at a stop sign, wait ten seconds and you'll see how long that is. anyway, this aggravates him as he barely stops when he comes up to it and continues to very dangerously tailgate me. so now i try the brake tap. i pull up a little to give my self some room and hit the brakes forcing him to slam on his. i found it funny cause he had to swerve to avoid collision. he still does not heed his aggressive driving. the revenge: now we get to the big 4 way intersection in the middle of town. 2-3 lanes at each stop. he pulls up beside me. i must have really scared him with the brake tap because he looked very flustered and wanted to say something to me. he rolls down his window (all my windows and sunroof were all ready open seeing as it was so nice that day) and looks at me. i look at him. i was expecting some sort of verbal insult so i made myself ready. "hey you faggot piece a...." before he could even get that ~~well thought out~~ statement out of his mouth, he was already choking on the lit cigarette butt i flicked directly into his mouth. when some of my friends and i were younger and would just be hanging out, we made flicking cigarettes a game. we would set up little cans or targets near one of our habitual smoking places and we all became very good at it. now, i knew i could hit him in the face, but i did not expect to get it into his mouth. but i don't feel bad in the slightest. the best part: so while he is dealing with his new ashy dinner, i turned left (left turn lane). he must have missed his turn to go while dealing with the cig so other cars started crossing the intersection. i'm sure he was fuming mad so he peels out, cuts across to make a left and almost hit 2 cars in the process (at least it looked like that through my mirrors). i see him make his way onto the street i was on. but right behind him was a cop who must have seen him commit about 12 moving violations as he cross that intersection. i see him pull over and i drive away feeling like a boss. **tl/dr: guy dangerously tailgates me, i flick a cig in his mouth and he gets pulled over by the cops.** edit: spellingi have been lurking on this sub for a long time and finally decided to write down my own pro revenge. i will delete the post in case i feel threatened or uncomfortable, but until then... enjoy. this is going to be a long story,as it took years to end, so bear with me. also, english is my second language so pardon me for grammar mistakes. everything started when i was around 16. i was drugged, sexually assaulted and very traumatized from that event. i couldn't remember much from it, only the cold feeling and some smells, so i could never actually press charges against the rapist. also, i was very alone in the whole situation - asside from a few friends i had, i had no one to actually rely on. my parents were emotionally abusive towards me so i learned not to trust them from my young age, and telling them about my problem was out of question. i just couldn't do it. so, it happened, and it took me a lot of strenght to get back to my normal self. i was depressed for a long time, developed anxiety and became self destructive, i drank way too much and did way too much drugs. during that time, i met a guy, let's call him douchebag, db for short. i met db over facebook, he claimed to have met me in the club, which was possible. (yes, i went to a club when i was 17. no, i didn't even need fake id.) he seemed nice, and i even met him over a cup of coffee for a few times. after a while, i started really liking him, but there was something just very off about him... and i couldn't put my finger on it. he was one of those rich kids, spoiled little brat, who liked to pretend he was very scary and important, mafia style. db was also 5 years older, and because he had money, i never heard him talk about doing anything other than football and going to clubs. i found it laughable, but i let him believe what he wanted. he also acted like he liked me in a sexual way, but didn't do anything about it. there were just some remarks that made me think that way. he was also friends with people from my high school, and this is important. i hung out with him and we did regular stuff - got coffee, talked, i would rant about my parents, he would joke with me. just normal stuff. after a few months of our friendship, i even told him what happened to me when i was 16. he didn't show much emotion and asked a few questions that seemed 'too much', but i didn't think much of it, i was just glad i told someone. months went by and i was less and less self destructive. it dawned on me i needed to change my ways, stop with the drugs, alcohol and stupid friendships. that's why when db asked to meet me for a coffee, i told him no. i realized along the way that he was shady as fucking hell, his friends were weird, i had no idea how he spent his days, he treated me with little to no respect, and he always chose small shady caffes to meet with me, as if he was embarrassed by me. i have had enough of it, and told him so. what i told him didn't phase him at all. he left me alone, as if i never mattered. after a few months, i started hearing rumors about myself. they were so nasty, so incredibly horrible, and the whole school talked behind my back about it, or even to my face. i was called a slut and what not, and spiraled into depression once again. i didn't think db would do it because from time to time he would contact me and acted very nice, and also he was not exactly the only person who could hate me. you know how high school is. the shit hit the highest point when i was 18, almost 19. by that time i somehow managed to deal with nasty shit people were talking about, i managed to deal with threats of violence and name calling. i also found a beautiful boyfriend - he was my rock, someone who i could rely on, someone who took care of me and gave me comfort and safety. i was with him for 6 months, and i have told him about my past. i thought it was important for him to understand why i was who i was. i kept my boyfriend very private. i didn't share our relationship on facebook or any other social media. i didn't talk about him a lot. only a few people knew about it and that was the best decision i ever made. db contacted me from time to time, he kept telling me i changed and joked how he liked me better before, because i was spontaneous and fun to be with. yeah, because doing fucking drugs and being suicidal in my free time was so much fun, right? i stopped speaking to him completely, and again, he didn't seem to care. it was one month before my final tests in high school. i was going to school, studying hard and hung out with my boyfriend, i was trying very hard to fix what i ruined years ago, and that was me, my reputation and my grades. i was in school one day and checked my inbox on fb, which i almost never did, just to find a message from some guy i have never met, asking if i was 'there'. against my better judgement, i told him he might have sent the message to a wrong person, and he immediately answered that he hadn't. i was puzzled, sitting in my german class, and staring at my phone. i asked who is he, and the guy started insulting me, calling me a whore, and told me i will do what he tells me to do, otherwise he will put the video of my rape online. i was now freaking out, to say the least. i thought he had to be joking, and told him so, and that is when the worst message of my life came. it was a picture. of me. a detailed picture, to say the least. i felt so sick. i got up, without saying anything to the teacher, and got the hell out of that class, barely holding myself together and bawling in panic as i stared at my phone. the first thing i decided to do was call my boyfriend. i could barely speak over the phone, i was hysterical, so he picked me up and took me to his place. i told him about everything and then it started to make sense, all of it. db had to be a part of that shit. my boyfriend told me to keep talking to the guy, while he called a few people to see who this guy was. he seemed to be in his thirties, had a dog and lived in the wealthiest part of the city. his fb profile was legit, he existed and wasn't afraid of me knowing his real identity. i asked what he wanted from me. i would almost puke every time i had to answer, but i had my bf with me, and he was furious. the guy knew my address and my mothers name, and threatened with that too. he said i can choose if i wanted to get naked on cam or have sex with him. his ended up demanding that i meet up with him and have sex with him. my boyfriend told me to invite the guy to meet with me in the open - we knew he wouldn't want to sit and drink with me coffee, but my bf couldn't let me just go to the adress. this is where we made a plan and it was going to go down the very next day. i had to meet with the guy on a little square near his place, surrounded by a park. it was remotely abandoned at that time of the day, and i sat down on a bench, shaking and trying to keep myself together. my boyfriend told me this half of the plan, but didn't actually tell me what he will do. finally, i was approached by the guy. he seemed younger than i thought, and wore that smug smile on his face that made my blood boil. he told me to get the fuck up and follow him. i was now terrified, looking around for my boyfriend, but he was nowhere to be found. so i had nothing else to do than to follow the guy. we were walking on a path, i was few steps behind him and he wasn't even looking at me. i was staring at the ground, concentrated on not fainting. all of a sudden, the guy stopped in his tracks. i stopped too. in front of us was standing my boyfriend, right in the middle of the path. the guy seemed confused, and turned around to me, just to notice 2 guys behind me, my bfs 2 best friends. they were just standing there, calm and silent. now, i didn't exactly describe my bf, but this is the best description- in a sea full of little fish, he was a goddamn shark. older than me, his face full of scars and he radiated that superiority. he knew how to be scary. i suddenly could breathe. my bfs best friend moved me out of the way, grabbing my hand and pulling me in the other direction before shit starts. i was so stressed at that time that i could barely walk, and just as i rounded the corner, i heard a muffled scream. my bfs best friend took me to my bfs place and hugged me while i cried, until my bf came back. his hands were bloody, his shirt too, but i could see he wasn't hurt. at that time i didn't ask what they did, but my bf assured me i was safe now. later i found out they beat the guy and made him tell them where the tape was. they crashed his phone, and went to his place where they destroyed all the blackmail material in front of the guy. he admitted he was the one who raped me, he stalked me and even sent his friend db to befriend me so he could control me and get info on me. db was in on it the whole time. later, i found out db became well known for abusing barely legal teenage girls, along with the guy. they would blackmail girls and make them do nasty stuff, and all the girls were alone just like i was. db ended up getting beaten too, ending up in hospital, and the guy moved to another country soon. i asked my bf if he did something to them and he just laughed, but i'm just happy it ended and i don't even want to know. i'm still with the same boyfriend. we truly delivered pro revenge. here's how the story starts. freshman year i had a pretty good life. moved out of my abusive moms and into my dads, was pushed up to jv football, made a lot of money selling weed, made a lot of friends, etc. around sophomore year i got into acid and shrooms, which pretty much fucked my life up. i'll just cut right to what happened. i was raped. i went to a party to sell weed/booze and ended up staying til about 2 am. got lit as fuck and decided to drop some acid, while drunk/high and on adderall. blacked out and woke up near my school with no pants and my bike like 20 feet away. chilled with my close friends the next day and they all started making fun of me. i barely remember what happened, but apparently one of them it go down. they started congratulating me on coming out of the closet, called me a faggot, played the song rap god repeatedly on my stereo and kept rewinding the gay bashing part, so on. i ended up kicking them out. over the next few weeks is when shit got out of hand. everyone 'knew' i was gay after that, got made fun of daily, and life was just fucking terrible. few people kept texting me things like, "hey man, i'll let you suck my dick if you give me some weed", someone spray painted my car and put sugar in the fuel tank, other shit too.. i ended up transferring schools, which didn't help. when i got to the new school, almost immediately rumors went around that i fucked a tranny, fucked a dog, and/or i fucked a guy. at this point i've heard a lot but those were the main ones that stuck out to me. anyway, 3 years later. obviously never made any new friends and saved a lot of my drug money, and got a job. moved out and into a new state about a month ago. moved into an apartment and going to college next semester. before i left i got revenge. i graduated 6 months early, and what i'm about to go into detail is over the course of the last few months before i left. everyone i mention is still in school... well some of them. when shit initially went down, i deleted every trace of myself on the internet (facebook/twitter) but i made alt accounts to keep up to date on what people were talking about (me), which was a big thing for awhile. i screenshotted posts, vulgar text messages, anything and everything someone did to me, i kept it. i had it all saved on my computer, never thought i'd go through with anything but my daily life was still a pile of shit thanks to this group of people. so, everything they ever did i had evidence of. when i transferred schools my dad had to go to several meetings with my schools principle. my school had a lot of 'bullying' problems. personally, before i left i knew 4 people who transferred schools freshman year alone because of shit like this. one because she was a 'slut', one because she was fat, one guy who was homeless, and the last i don't remember. but at these meetings, the principal told my dad that i could have the people who did this held accountable and the school takes this shit very seriously. i said no way in hell; my life was already a mess, i didn't want to bring attention to myself i just wanted out. 3 years later.. i brought in about 100 pages of me being shit on by fellow classmates online. i went in after hours and she (the principal) was still there and remembered who i was. i told her everything i just said now. the rape (not the drugs, just said i was drunk), the vandalism, everything. i told her how people at the new school started doing the same things to me as the people here, how when i saw them in public they made a big deal about it, how they ruined my life. page after page of harassment, bullying, threats. she brought in the schools police liaison who called in 2 other officers. we went through every single paged, photocopied everything, identified everyone involved, and i filed numerous police reports. 9 people. i essentially ruined the lives of 9 people. i believe most are facing felony harassment lawsuits as is, one confessed to vandalizing my car, one was immediately charged with possession of weed and paraphernalia (they searched her car) and i believe most were expelled on the spot. none of them will receive their high-school diplomas unless they weasel out of it. for 3 years i sat in agony for the things these people did. for 3 years i thought about how i could get revenge, if at all, and what the best way to do it was. out of all the things they did to me and everything that happened, i can say without a doubt that after seeing their mugshots, i'm finally at peace. this is a little long, sorry about that, but i've been waiting decades to tell this story. i grew up in a small town in the south. summer jobs were hard to come by, unless you wanted to drive an hour away to the city. we had a few mechanics, some gas stations, a general store, and a church on every block. there were a lot of farms around that would hire high school kids, but summers in the south are hot and humid. the holy grail was an indoor job with air conditioning. the summer before my senior year, i thought that my buddies and i-- let's call them fred and ben-- had landed an awesome job at the general store. the owner, who i will call dickface, needed three people to unload the trucks and stock shelves in the morning. we had to report for work at 5 am, but it was only three days a week, and we were done by 10, meaning we had the rest of the day to lay around and fish. now, there were some red flags that i, being young, did not recognize at the time. the fact that dickface wrote iou slips at the end of every week instead of checks was a huge one. he promised to pay us in full at the end of the month. we were kind of pissed that we wouldn't have money to spend, but it was an easy job with good hours, so we kept working, looking forward to that sweet paycheck at the end of the month. with it being an under-the-table job, there wasn't too much i could do. the time comes. dickface tells us at the end of our shift that our paychecks are clipped to our time cards. ecstatic to finally be paid, we go in, open the envelopes... and see that we have each been given a $50 gift certificate to the store. the strange and growing mixture of confusion and horror is a set of feelings that i will always remember. fred, ben, and i approach dickface behind the cash register and tentatively ask when we are *really* going to get paid. he looked at us like we were the dumbest people he had ever seen. "that *is* your pay," he said. we called bs and demanded real checks. "well, i can't do that. all i can give you is the gift certficiate." what happened next was what you'd expect from a couple of pissed off high school red necks. obscenities were shouted. some things were thrown. fred kicked over a candy display. we stormed out of there swearing and i was just seeing absolute red. that fucker had used us for *slave labor.* took advantage of some high school kids to get free work for a month! it went without saying that we were thirsty for vengeance. now, this was a long time ago. like pre-internet, pre-desert storm long ago. and we lived in a very rural area. so we couldn't just call some bureau of labor, or go viral on social media, or whatever people think of as "revenge" these days. hell, we couldn't even really tell our parents, cuz they would have said it was a learning experience or some such thing. there was really no concept of worker's rights or anything like that. hell, in this particular state, there still isn't to this day. we had to handle this ourselves. from then on, we had nightly meetings on a piece of property owned by fred's dad. there was only one purpose, one subject of discussion: revenge. we went through all the usual options-- arson, vandalism, and so on. but in the end we decided that straight out theft would be the most reasonable option. we were jipped for a month's work, and for the scales of justice to balance, we needed payment. as i said, this was a long time ago. dickface had some cameras, but they were poor quality, and there were only a few. one out front, one by the register, and one over the beer coolers. there were no cameras in the loading dock or the back room, where the beer overstock was stored. we knew this because we had seen the little monitor displaly in dickface's office. there was also an old doorway that was boarded over and sealed with polyurethane in the back of the building, but was otherwise unsecured. in other words, our work was cut out for us. we parked in the woods behind the store and watched it for a few nights to see if dickface had taken any additional security precautions in light of his deception. he hadn't. the closing cashier just locked the front door at 9 pm and left. we met up the next night at about 2 am. the town was dead asleep. we piled into fred's oversized pickup truck, drove to the store, killed the headlights, and pulled up to the loading dock. my heart had been thudding in my chest the whole drive over, but now a sort of steel calm had come over me. i was hyper-alert, yet calm as the eye of a storm. our time had come. the wooden door went down with ease when ben put his shoulder to it. we slipped into the backroom, stationed ourselves in a sort of assembly line by the beer racks, and we unloaded the place. cases of beer and jugs of wine practically flew out the back into fred's truck with ruthless efficiency. in the space of maybe less than twenty minutes we had the back room cleaned out. we cleaned out that fucking prick so fast i don't think he would have had time to shit his pants if he somehow caught us, we would have been done and gone. we pulled the defunct door back into place, threw a tarp over our loot, and drove to the same property where we had held our vengeance meetings. there was a disused tool shed towards the back, behind some pretty thick bush, and that's where we had decided to put everything. unloading and carrying all the stuff took considerably longer than snatching it, even with a wheelbarrow, and the sky was starting to shade pink by the time we had it all squared away. nevertheless, we were all able to make it to fred's house before his parents woke up and got suspicious. the next few days were tense. i saw two sheriff's deputies parked in front of the store the following day and felt the bottom drop out of my stomach. we had come up with a cover story and rehearsed it multiple times in case we were questioned, and i expected cops to come knocking on my door any second... but they never did. i never even saw a report on the local news. in hindsight, dickface probably knew it was us, but didn't want it to get out that he had used slave labor in his store. hell, i bet the only reason he called the cops in the first place was so he could file a report and write it off on his taxes. in any case, we had hundreds, maybe even thousands of dollars' worth of beer sitting in an old tool shed, and as young southern boys it would be a bleedin' sin to let it go to waste. we started "celebrating," cautiously at first. but it didn't take long for word to get out that there were a couple of guys who could get their hands on beer, and by the end of the summer, we were hosting bonfires on the property that were absolutely packed with high school kids. we even had some offering to buy the beer from us, and by the beginning of september we had made back any money that we lost out on thanks to dickface's slavery shenanigans. these gatherings included a fair amount of chicks, and i think it's safe to say i lost my virginity thanks to the stolen beer in the shed. it was the best summer of my life. as for dickface, i never saw or heard from him again. he sold the store a year later to a guy who seemed much nicer. i got another job working there the following summer for actual paychecks. the beer didn't even run out till the start of senior year. the last i saw of it was chugged by fred at the end of a football game. tl;dr boss doesn't pay for a month of work. we steal lots of beer, get laid, and have a great summer.on november 17th 2010, i was involved in a major vehicle accident (18 year old kids fault). i was in the hospital for 6 days and was on disability home rest for 3 months for recovery (back issues/fused spine). when i was coherent enough to deal with business, i started talks with his insurance company. from the very start, they low balled me on price from just about everything. $600 value for a $3500 car (kelly blue book valued it at $3690) and i had a brand new paint job on it from 3 months prior (their value: $32) and 4 brand new tires not even 2 months old (valued: $5 a tire). they brow beat me into thinking that this was how the processed worked. nearly convinced me to settle. this insurance company wanted to cut me a check for $700 bucks and some change within 5 minutes of talking to me. the negotiations started horribly and i couldn't get them to budge for nearly a week. i talked to my lawyer and he couldn't help but gave me great advice. i got additional advice from my own insurance agent on how to deal with them and basically asked professionals on how to approach this. it turns out, this insurance company the kid used was the shadiest last resort of the last resort kind. my lawyer (who dealt with the medical bills, not car issues) told me, [*edit: removed apparent personal information*] with the record this kid had, he was paying close to **$1600 every 6 months**. he was uninsurable by all standards but it was his insurance company that was the worst of the worst. they were playing the waiting/scare tactics game with me. what they hadn't planned on was a guy with nothing but time on his hands and my jimmies had definitely been rustled. i inquired on every single item in and on my car. i located receipts, got estimates on everything i had and bombarded them with faxes and paperwork. at every opportunity, i begged and pleaded with the companies i dealt with in estimates to over inflate the price of the cost. $700 repair for a leather jacket, $2300 for a dell i3 laptop, $160 for "designer" jeans (probably kirkland signature if i recall). this insurance company only budged a bit on the fair market value price so they started playing a new game with me. not taking my calls or not responding to my emails. when my claims adjuster agent did call back, my phone would ring once... (as in 5 seconds) and he would hang up so it looks like they made an attempt to call. i would immediately return the call but would get, "*your claims adjuster just stepped out of the office*" or "*he's headed into a meeting*" from the operator/receptionist. nearly 3 weeks of these phone tag and email aversions games led me to create a detailed itinerary of my agents whereabouts and excuses of why he couldn't take my calls. i then upped my game. i called his bosses, talked to other agents and told my story to all of them. when that got no where, i upped my game even more. i called **every hour, on the hour** for 8 business days in a row. i was on a first name basis with 4 of his co-workers, knew his supervisors name and bosses name and had all of their extensions and email addresses on speed dial. i was even ccing all of them on every email i sent so my agent had 0 excuse that he didn't get my calls. shortly after, a settlement offer was sent via email (as he refused to talk to me at all over the phone) in the amounts of $1800 for my vehicle and $1200 for my personal items. i wanted $3500 and $1750 and wasn't going to settle for less. he chose to make this personal and not business so i did the only logical thing... i made it business in the worst possible way. i called on a friday afternoon and left a message on ever co-workers phone as well as the supervisors phone that because my agent refuses to negotiate properly nor return my calls, that i would now be calling all of them every hour, on the hour as well as the supervisor and boss. leaving detailed messages to call me back and offer me what my vehicle and personal items were worth. i stated i would be starting this on monday morning, 8am sharp. needless to say, by tuesday afternoon, i had a settlement offer of $3200 for my vehicle and $1730 for my personal effects. (dollar figures that were very fair and almost generous in the industry) but i replied back with the following. "*see, what bothers me is that i would have settled for less than this amount far earlier in the negotiations. but after all this time and effort, i will not settle for anything less than $3530 for my vehicle and $1810 for my personal effects. i will start calling again tomorrow morning until these terms are met.*" within 2 hours of leaving that message, i had a new email with the settlement offer of $3530 for my vehicle and $1810 for personal effects. i accepted much to their delight. **tl:dr slimeball insurance company tries to use lowball and scare tactics to get me to settle for less than the value of my car. i bombard them with phonecalls and emails every hour on the hour for almost 2 weeks.** *edit: this post was temporarily removed because some "unnamed" redditor claimed pi was shown. its since edited and the personal information removed and its now back up. mod approved once again.*i've been a real estate broker in chicago for nearly 20 years. i started at a very small independent brokerage. it was my first week there when the broker/owner gave me a lead. he was older and wasn't in very good health, so he passed a lot of his leads to his agents. one of the broker's friends passed away and the friend's son wanted to sell the house. i call the son who tells me he's known the broker for 30-plus years and how close their families were. he seems like a really nice guy. i go over and check out the house. i work up a gorgeous comparative market analysis. i have other brokers check my numbers (i was new and wanted to do a perfect job for my new client). i rehearse my presentation, have my stuff professionally printed, prepare for any possible questions, have responses ready for objections, and i head out. i dazzle this guy with my presentation. he likes the $135,000 list price i recommended. he's fine with the commission. he has no objections, but he asks me to give him 2 months to clean out the house, give his siblings a chance to go through everything and then repaint. now, i know how to handle this, but at the time, i just said i'd call him in 2 months to get it listed... bad move, but i trusted him because he and deceased father were so close with my broker. i didn't expect what would come next. three days later, i'm driving through town and i see a "for sale by owner" sign in the yard. that's when i realized that i wasted several hours doing work for him and he completely bluffed me and used me. i didn't call him back then. nowadays, i wouldn't either, but that's only because i'd have the listing before he had a chance to put that fsbo sign in the yard. experience counts for a lot. anyway, my broker was at city hall about 5-6 weeks later paying for transfer stamps when he just happened to notice in the registry that the previous customer was the son. the son had just paid for transfer stamps earlier which essentially meant that the house had sold. i waited until the prescribed "2 months" and called the son for my revenge. i played stupid and the conversation went something like this... me: hey len, it's myzyri over at abc realty. i figured i'd give you a call to see if you got the house cleaned out and repainted because i had a relocation company call me with info from a doctor looking to move to the area. when i talked to the guy, i thought about your house and mentioned it to him. since it's only 2 blocks from the hospital where he's going to be working and i told him how nice it was, he basically told me to make you an offer sight-unseen. i couldn't remember what i said the house was worth, but i told him $215,000. he couldn't believe how inexpensive it was, but he's living in new york. he said your house sounds like it's three times the size of his and half the price of what he'd pay in new york city. so, i don't remember what i told you it was worth, but he's all cash and wants to be able to move in in 3 weeks, so, would $215,000 work for you because i can write it up, fax it over to him for signatures, and get you done...? (there was a long silence before he exploded.) len: you fucking asshole! you told me it was worth $135,000! me: well, we didn't even list yet and it looks like i just got you $80,000 more! what are you all upset about?!?! len: i just sold that fucking house! i sold it for $130,000 because you fucking told me that was what i should expect to get! me: oh damn, you sold it? that's good for you and good to know that that my estimate on the sale price was spot on. well, no problem, i'm sure i can find something else for my buyer. len: fuck your buyer! i want $80,000! me: i don't know where you're going with this. you sold your house for a price you were happy with. i just happened to get an out of towner on a fluke who was willing to pay more. but hey, you sold it and you got fair market value so you did great! len: fuck you, you prick! i want that $80,000! me: i've never heard of this before, but if you can get the house back, i can talk to my buyer and see if he'll wait for you to close again. i don't know if that's even a possibility. len: no! you're going to pay me $80,000! me: well, that's not going to happen. i can just hire a professional appraiser to show that you got market value for the house. my mistake was quoting my buyer the wrong price, not you. len: you can expect to hear from my attorney! me: that's fine. but i'm going to have to let you go now, len. i've got to get over to your old house to see if the new owners would be willing to give me a copy of their appraisal and see if they might want to sell it for a quick profit. do you know if they moved in already? len: mother fucker! and that's when he slammed the phone down. i would never do this now even though i have plenty of people who waste my time. it comes with the job and getting upset doesn't make it better. however, i still think about that call today and while part of me feels like a jerk, i still get a little smile thinking about him kicking himself for screwing me over. here's a little more to the story... something i do to drum up business is offer help finding tax comparables for people so they can try to get a tax reduction from the county. i actually went to meet the new owners of that house and offered to help them dispute their taxes free of charge. they were actually a really nice couple and they ended up using me to sell that house 8 years later just before the market crash. so, they'd done some really nice stuff to the house, had a top notch price, and they ended up getting $345,000 for it. they were doing a back-to-back closing (sell one and buy the new one on the same day). the house they were buying burned down, but they still sold theirs and moved in with relatives while they looked for something new. the market literally crashed two months later while they were living with the wife's grandparents. they stayed there for two more years and then i helped them buy a huge 4000 square foot foreclosure for $130,000. new construction that hadn't been completed. just needed trim, a garage, some light fixtures, and a kitchen which they were happy to install on their own considering the price and location. it's currently worth about $550,000 since that area is just booming again. they've been very happy with me and have sent me a few referrals. as a side note, i told them about len (a very watered down version that didn't make me look like a dick) and they happily gave me a copy of their appraisal just in case he decided to call a lawyer. they said he was a jerk to deal with and got into a huge fight with his siblings at the closing saying he should get $20,000 more because he had to handle the sale "and that's what the realtor would have charged!" (no... since his dad was close with my broker, we were only charging him 4.5% - $5,850 on $130,000.) soooo... did he ever call a lawyer? yes. about a year later, he called the only lawyer he knew. another family friend. my broker's brother. the brother talked to my broker, who then talked to me. i gave him the market analysis and the appraisal. we never heard another thing about it. tl;dr: guy uses me and wastes my time. i end up giving him a bs story that makes him think he lost out on $80,000-$85,000. we all know the saying, "in order to make an omelette, you gotta crack a few eggs". a very down to earth saying with a lot of meaning and truth behind it. i guess you can even apply this saying to revenge in some cases, particularly my story of revenge. a story of revenge so great, that it might be one of the best cases of revenge so far in the year 2016, or at least i tell myself that. in the end, unfortunately, there was some collateral damage, but hey, you know the saying... i am a former marine living in a semi-small town that i am not from, trying to make ends meet while i wait for my tech school to start this summer. i've been out of the marines for a few years now, and after partying day in and day out and making ends meet by bar tending at various bars around my state, i have finally convinced myself that it's time to stop being a man-child and work toward a stable career. hence, i've enrolled myself in a tech school. in the mean time, i figured can squeeze as much as i can out of the service industry until i complete school and graduate. well, that was the plan and it still is, but not at the restaurant/bar i thought it would be. i moved to this town from another state with my girlfriend, due to a tragedy in her family. after living off savings for a few months, i decided to snag a job to make things easier to stay afloat. i ended up at a quaint little restaurant very close to where my girlfriend worked. a restaurant recently re-opened by it's corporate ownership after a terrible franchise owner had control of it. all of the staff were new hires, from the top to the bottom. the restaurant was now full service, as opposed to ordering at a counter. it had a beautiful mahogany bar that meshed well with the theme of the restaurant, that was sectioned off from the dining side of it. great food and even better drink specials, the perfect place for me to make ends meet while i attend school. it was convenient in so many ways, my girlfriend and i could save gas by driving in one vehicle when our schedules matched, she could come eat lunch or dinner on her break and get a discount on food, things just seemed perfect. when i first started working at this restaurant, management seemed to really like having me around. i was very good at entertaining guests, i brought people in to the bar, and i was great at making drinks. one night stands out the most, i had a couple walk in to the restaurant minutes from closing. often when this happens, you will get a server who is upset that they have to do their job a little longer, and that will reflect on their service. not me, it is their money and we are still technically open 10 minutes until we close, so i am going to treat these guests just like i would any other guest. the couple clearly had a great night and left me a very big tip. the next day i was shown an email that was sent to corporate, with nothing but praises about my service and attitude. i assumed it was from the same couple, but who knows. after that incident, the atmosphere and management's attitude toward me seemed to negatively shift. before we get into that though, let's discuss the management team. first we have the gm, let's call him "jack". "jack" is a round man in his early 30s who on the surface seems like a stand up guy, you'd think he'd have your back until the bitter end when you first meet him. then we have "nessa", the assistant gm. "nessa" is a short woman in her late 40s, my first impressions was that she is a quiet but professional woman, does things by the book. and finally we have "courtney". "courtney" was the "bar manager"(i will explain the quotations a little further in the story), from the get-go, courtney rubbed me the wrong way. courtney was in her late 30s and never really smiled. something about her just seemed dishonest, i couldn't quite put my finger on it at first. oh and i should also mention "kara". "kara" was a woman about 29 years old and she was best friends with jack, the gm. she was the other bartender for the restaurant that would work shifts that i didn't work. in the end i had nothing but great things to say about kara, and i didn't want things to end the way they did, but hey, you know the saying... now back to the story, after receiving the positive review, i noticed i would get flak from both nessa and courtney for little things. they would reprimand me in rude ways without any tact. one night, nessa out of nowhere told me i was arrogant. of course i defended myself and this caused a dispute that ended up with both of us apologizing, i still have no idea what i was apologizing for, but i just wanted a peaceful end to the matter. another day, courtney pulled me aside as i came in for my shift, and told me that guests had told her that i was giving them free drinks, she tried to get me to fess up to this and i vehemently denied the claims, i even told her to check the cameras or i will have jack check the cameras. i never ever stole from the bar, or gave people free drinks. then there was that time i came in for a shift and courtney immediately jumped down my throat for "leaving tables a mess"(later proven to be a lie) before leaving the bar after closing, she says this as she walks out the door from her morning shift leaving three tables unbussed! it was like something out of a comedy sketch. another thing that may have struck you as odd, courtney the "bar manager" was scheduling herself bar shifts, while getting management pay. odd, right? my theory on this sudden change of attitude toward me from the management, is that it may have not been so sudden at all. i don't think courtney liked me from the start, i remember one time when i was training, i had to make an easy drink for a guest because she didn't know how to make it. she put pineapple juice n a long island iced tea... yuck! this was probably embarrassing for her and i remember the guest making a comment along the lines of, "maybe he should be bar manager! hahaha", said in jest, but i could tell that it really upset courtney. i also was told that by another employee, that during a busy night over the holidays, courtney told nessa and jack that she thought i was stealing from the bar. i cannot verify these claims, but after the conclusion of everything that happened, i wouldn't put it past courtney. this negative stigma toward me most likely rubbed off on jack, because surely enough, his attitude toward me changed. i started to feel held hostage and regretting going to work. i felt as though my stature was being diminished behind my back, my reputation was being tarnished, i was sinking in quicksand and had no way of defending myself when all these claims were made behind my back. one shift, my girlfriend was on her lunch break, and while i was in the back getting side work done, jack had made a rude comment to her or was very rude to her. she wasn't clear when she told me about it later that night, but she didn't feel comfortable going back in there. her feelings were hurt. i confronted jack about this and he just brushed it off and quickly changed the subject by telling me to "find something to do". all of this hate would soon hit a boiling point, and that's where the omelette comes in... a little over a week ago, i was enjoying a night off. me and the gf watched some "making a murderer"(ironically relevant to the story) before both drifting off to sleep. i woke up bright and early the next day, did some laundry and got some cleaning done while my gf slept in, she works two jobs and deserves it. i took a shower and prepared to head in to work, hopefully making some good tips. i walk in 5 minutes early and the managers are all at a table outside of the bar talking. they see me walk in and sat me down. they told me that the night before, someone had served a minor some drinks and it got reported to the police somehow. whew, it wasn't me i thought, i didn't even work that night and i always id people i am unsure of. they told me that i need to be sure to always id people and i assured them that i do. both jack and nessa walked off to the dining side. i talked with courtney a bit and the conversation was a bit odd. she said, "yeah we need to be sure to id people and you probably just assumed he was 21-" i cut her off and told her that it wasn't me who worked last night. she stuttered back, "oh i meant kara". yeah it was kara who messed up. kara who i really loved working with, but who was also best friends with jack. so you can assume how things were taken care of. this would of immediately been my termination if it were me in kara's shoes. i didn't hold any grudge, i was glad she kept her job. after the doors were locked that night. nessa came up to me and brought up the underage incident, again it was odd, she spoke kind of loud but not rudely and told me i need to be sure and id people from now on so this doesn't happen again. i stood my ground, i told her that with all due respect, it wasn't me who served the kid. she said "look i know, i am just saying". what were they trying to pull here? i had the next day off, chilling in my apartment all by myself, playing hearthstone, eating like a pig. when my phone buzzes. it was a notification telling me that i need to come in to work an hour early because the managers were having a meeting. no sweat, more hours more money. i continue doing my thing. the next day i go in an hour early as instructed, once again, the managers are sitting at a table near the bar. they all stare at me as i walk in, things didn't seem right. jack tells me that he needs to talk to me. jack and nessa both sit me down in the dining area. jack tells me that he heard that i had a dispute with nessa a few weeks back, and he can't have that attitude around here. he tells me he is letting me go. i was shocked, i told him that me and nessa already hashed out our differences and this happened weeks ago. i look over at nessa and she shoots me a smirk, "well now you are talking to your gm about it". i felt the marine in me start to come out, i was getting angry and about to do something stupid. it took everything in me not to throw the table over and punch jack right in the jaw. i took a deep breath, stood up, told them "good to go" and walked out. and courtney was sure to give me a sarcastic "byyyeeee" as i walked out the door. what the hell just happened?! this was weeks ago and they are firing me for this?! this can't be right. i get to my car and slam my hands down on the steering wheel. i was so angry, i just wanted to call my girlfriend and hear her tell me everything was going to be alright. i grab my phone and find her name in my contacts, i'm thinking to myself how i am going to break the news, "babe they fired me for no reason! jack is such a fucking prick! kara served someone underage and nothing came of that but they fire me for something that happened weeks ago!". i didn't hit the call button, i put my phone down. it all hit me at once. these motherfuckers were trying to burn me for what kara did. since it got reported to the police, somebody needed to pay and it sure as hell wasn't going to be kara. i peeled out as i left the parking lot, not because i was angry, but because i needed to act fast. if i didn't act fast, they would get away with murder. most the people who join the marines, join to fight. as crazy as this sounds, this is largely why people enlist in the infantry side of marines. people like us have a desire to fight, and the marines is a great outlet. most marines love fighting, most of us love conflict. we thrive off of it, and we know how to react when the cards aren't in our favor. we are generally some of the nicest and loyal people you will ever meet, but you don't fuck with a us marine... i open my door and rush to grab my laptop. my girlfriend asks me what's wrong and i quickly say "nothing babe got fired love you". grab my laptop and sit on my recliner. she says "what?!". i just motion with my hands 1 second as i load up google. i find the restaurant's corporate website, it didn't have a number for corporate but it did have the email address of every single franchise in the company. "even better" i thought to myself. so i wrote a long email to a franchise, copied and pasted it to every other one. i explained in detail about the favoritism that was happening with jack and kara. i explained how kara had served someone underage and i had the feelings they were trying to pin it on me. i explained how courtney would get manager pay while taking tips as a bartender. i explained how nessa would occasionally have me make a drink and she would give it to her teenage daughter, who also worked at the restaurant. i provided times, dates, and even showed them the email i sent to our state's alcohol control about the underage drinking incidents to ensure my hands were clean. i explained how an expensive bottle of jack daniel's sinatra seemed to have a leak in it nights after jack had worked. every bit of dirt i ever saw or heard about i put in the email, and i let every franchise in the company know about it. i demanded that i get a call back and i also demanded that i get my termination papers to make sure i wasn't being framed. i typed so fast and things just seemed to melt in to place as i made the email. my fingers were my weapon, you don't fuck with a marine. my girlfriend is staring at me the entire time. "what the hell is going on?!". i finish the email and explain to her the situation. she asks me if i am afraid other's will get in to trouble, i tell her... well, you know the saying. i fill out applications and the same day i get a call from a very well known and popular restaurant, they want me to come in for an interview the next day. perfect! i already have another job. i didn't hear from corporate at all that day, it was very late in the afternoon so i expected as much. the next day i get a phone call early in the morning. it is corporate hr that owns the restaurant that i worked at. she tells me that they are on their way to the restaurant to investigate my claims. she asks me a bunch of questions, i am guessing i was being recorded. i stayed consistent and honest, she tells me all of the things i mentioned in the email were 100% against company policy, but the claims would be investigated before any action was taken. i asked her if they have access to the camera feed, she ensured me that they did. thank fucking god for cameras. she told me to call back immediately if i could remember anything else that was going on. we hung up and i got dressed and headed out the door for my interview at a new potential job. well, the interview couldn't of gone better. i met most of the management at this team and i got such an amazing vibe from them. they even want to cross train me as a bartender almost immediately. most of the time, this place only promotes from within, they must have really liked me! so i got the job and i am going to try my hardest to be a great employee. anyways, back to my revenge story. i later got word from an insider that they did indeed try and pin the underage incident on me. little did they know... i am laying in bed that same night, drifting off in to sleep listening to sam harris's podcast, my girlfriend is sitting up in bed browsing facebook. all of the sudden, she gasps! she startled me because i was almost asleep, i jump up and asks her what's wrong. she shows me her phone... "heh, wow." i said calmly. i guess things were worse off there than i thought, but damn i didn't expect things to get taken that far. well you don't fuck with a marine, i thought. i got out of bed and made some sweet tea. "do you feel bad?" the gf said. "well babe, [you know the saying]( ." edit: thanks for the gold! edit 2: let's not witchhunt people, what's done is done and justice has been served. no it isn't the restaurant people have been posting pics of. edit 3: names have been changed from letters to fake names to make it easier to readyears back my friend's bf left her in a load of debt, and she bore near all the cost of him moving out and then some as he vindictively racked up credit in her name. in a fit of revenge planning at the time, she took advantage of the wrong idea with the right offer at the right time and got a credit card in his name, thinking she could use it back at him the same way, or use it as leverage if he started the same shit up again. she was broken into a couple of months ago, she was pretty sure it was him, and the wheels of justice have been turning slowly regarding that, but among the items her ex stole was his own credit card. he banged up 17k on it before confronting her last week about it being his card not hers. he's an idiot, and just walked into a pit of his own creation. hell yeah.i apologize up front for the rather lengthy post, but it's all true and was my greatest revenge. it all starts about 10 years ago. i was happily engaged to a girl who i knew for about 9 years but had only been dating for about 1 year. let's call her "nancy mcfuckingcuntbag" all was good, she had her dream engagement ring, we had a nice house together, both had steady jobs and the wedding plans were coming along nicely. about two months prior to the wedding we found out we were going to have a baby! such happiness had never been felt before. wedding plans continued and the big day was only 28 days away. i come home from work and find that nancy isn't home. i call her to see if she got held up at work and to see what time she might be home. but nancy wasn't at work, she was at her grandmother's house, in another state. nancy calmly told me that she no longer wanted to get married and that she was not coming home. complete and utter shock. what in the fuck just happened? i try to call her back, her phone is off. i call her grandmother, no answer. what about the wedding? what about our baby? what about everything? no answers. no contact for three days. three days of no breath in my body, no clues, nothing. on day four nancy shows up and starts packing her stuff. she won't say a word to me. nothing. she leaves and sends me an email saying that she can't be with me, again no reasons. i begin calling her sister and asking what the fuck happened. her sister tells me that she has no idea but gives me their mom's phone number. strange, nancy said her mom was out of the picture because she was an abusive alcoholic. nevertheless i call mom. mom tells me that i am lucky number three who has fallen for this trap. nancy cut mom out of her life so mom couldn't ruin nancy's game of milking guys for money and resources. nancy has been pregnant twice before and had "miscarriages" and milked guys for everything she could before running off to super christian grandma's house and claiming abuse so grandma will take her in until the dust settles and she can do it again. what. the. fuck. weeks go by and still no contact with nancy. i've lost 20 pounds and have been counseled at my job for poor work performance. my family is mad as fuck. family members lost money on travel plans to the wedding, and i am mortified. i lost all of the deposits on everything for the wedding since it was less than 30 days before it was cancelled. i'm piss broke. i check our joint bank account, negative $2k. fuck. guess i won't be paying the mortgage. i start to get my shit together and my sadness turns to rage. i had so much anger inside of me i actually had to scale it back a bit or i might have gone to prison. a month and a half after the split i get a text. "i had a miscarriage, you stressed me out too much and my daughter is dead now"....... daughter? i was having a daughter? you're blaming me for this? that's it, i'm going to kill this bitch..... no, wait.... breathe.... get your shit together.... take this bitch apart at the seems. a few days of xanax and whiskey get me over the hump of sadness again... back to rage... let's do this. most of nancy's shit was still at my house (which i have to walk away from because i can afford it). i start to pack it all up and in order to get rid of it somehow. but i stumble upon a few things. her résumé and her checkbook to her personal bank account. i read her résumé, it's all bullshit like everything else. i hop on the computer, create a new yahoo email address and send a long letter to her corporate office telling them line-by-line how it's all lies. feels good. operation checkbook. i sign her name on every check and rip them all out of the book. i drive 30 minutes to the seediest part of town and leave them on a sidewalk in front of an am pm... too much good stuff. i go back home and throw out all of her shit. fuck it. sue me bitch. except her laptop, i keep that shit. two weeks go by. nancy calls, i don't answer. voicemail says she got laid off due to cut backs. i know that's not true. fuck yeah. two more weeks go by and letters from some district attorney's bad check restitution program begin to trickle in the mail. fuck yeah. oh and the registration renewal for her car. shred all that shit. oh, while i'm at it i might as well put a change of address in for her at the post office. where to? the temporary shelter for the homeless sounds good. i hear through a mutual friend that since nancy is out of work now she is staying with friends and supported financially by super christian grandma. fuck that. i hop on her laptop and make a new yahoo email address that is only one number different from nancy's real email. i email super christian grandma a video of nancy finger blasting herself that i had saved. i titled the email "hey grandma check out this video i took of my job, i hope i uploaded it right" fuck yeah. email reply. "you are disgusting. i hope your new job pays well because i'm not supporting you if you act like that" oh, damn.. a two for one deal. embarrassment and financial distress. noice. weeks go by and i get a call from rent-a-center. wtf? oh they want all of nancy's furniture back. i had no idea it was rent to own shit. i tell them i don't have it. they argue and say she says in have it. i stick to my guns and tell them i do not have it and i don't know where it is. that night i burn it all in the yard. $4200 owed. zing. i find out that nancy has a new job and as i am planning my next move i hear great news. nancy has been arrested and is in jail for embezzlement. apparently she had some money problems and stole $5k out of petty cash and got busted. oh god this is great. she fucked herself. months go by with no updates, and then i hear from a friend that she was bailed out of jail by grandma after only a few days and ended up taking a plea bargain for a felony conviction and three years of probation along with restitution. rekt. i hang my hat and call it a day. i have gotten my revenge. i'll leave it there, time to move on. a couple months later the phone rings. it's a repo company looking for info on where nancy is because they are trying to repossess her car. hahaha, ok, one last nail in the coffin. i make a few calls and find the address where she is staying. i call the repo company back and give them the info. they thank me and say i am eligible for a $100 reward if they get the car back. "no thanks, this one's on me." nancy is now a felon, jobless, and a single mom of a kid she recently had from some random guy. she lives in an apartment with her brother and his girlfriend. i am happily married with a beautiful daughter and a great life. yesterday i get a facebook message from nancy. "congrats on the marriage and daughter, i'm glad you're happy" i reply, "go fuck yourself :)" she blocked me. life is good. sometimes taking the low road heals the soul. being the only person who can bail someone out is delightful. years ago, in grad school, i was living with my girlfriend. her computer had died, so she was using my desktop machine to write her thesis. she never made backups of any sort. ever. even though i repeatedly warned/reminded her of the dangers of not backing up, she shrugged it off with "it'll be fine!" then came the day when i caught her cheating. not just flirting with another guy, i don't give a fuck about that, but walked in on them banging in the apartment. later i also discovered chat logs on my computer as well. we broke up, and because the apartment was on a month-to-month lease at that point i just walked. a week later, i get a call from her asking for all the files associated with her thesis. you know, the ones that were on my computer that she never backed up despite my urging. me: "sure, i'll be happy to get those to you. for $500." her (screaming): "what?" me: "oh, right. those files are incredibly important, representing about ten months of work at this point, aren't they?" her: "yes!" me: "that'll be $1,000, then." her: "fuck you!" me: "$1,100 - and if you swear at me again the price goes up. the price goes up by $100 a day. i'd act fast or it'll get pretty expensive. it's too bad there wasn't some cheap way to have a second copy of those files, isn't it? oh, and it'll have to be cash." i hung up on her. in the end, she paid $1,800.sure, we've all dealt with idiotic craigslist sellers out there, but this woman was too greedy not to have this coming to her: i collect vintage road bicycles, of which one showed up on our local craigslist for $100, being sold by greedy bicycle lady (g.b.l.). it is an upper-entry-level road bike by one of the better english manufacturers of the 1970s. at best, it's worth $300 cleaned, fixed up, and perfect. as it is now, $200-250 tops. i know a good deal when i see one, so i email g.b.l. with my phone number and tell her i can come by within the hour and buy it. shortly thereafter, i receive this response in my inbox: "ok, so i know realize that the bike is worth more. i've upped my price to $200. give me a call if you're interested." it's not as good a deal as before, but it's still a bike i'd like to have in my collection. this time, i call her to confirm an appointment time. i haven't been talking to her for 30 seconds before i am informed that the price is now $350, based on the latest inquiry she has had, which have been "numerous." i don't mind a bit of friendly competition, but this is ridiculous. sure, she has a right to getting what the market will offer, but deals cannot be made with sellers that cannot stand behind their word. i ask if she's willing to stand by this price if i commit to driving halfway across town to pick it up right that minute. "no." "lady, i doubt you'll find anyone willing to put up with this nonsense. i could drive across town and find that you've doubled the price by the time i get there. good day." *edit: i think it should be noted that i'm really not interested in the bike anymore at this point. vintage roadbikes were unusually common in my city at the time of this story, and i knew - with time - i could put my efforts towards something much nicer (and i did, with the acquisition of two chrome schwinn paramounts shortly thereafter). not to mention that my collection was already quite sizable (at the time, a fleet of over 15 classic and vintage road and touring bicycles. yes, i had the n=n+1 syndrome quite bad back then).* but back to the story. my last email seemed to end any hope of further discussion...but too many old movies have taught me that the greedy person is the easiest to have "fun" with. especially when "spare" email addresses are close at hand. no longer was it about the bike. within 10 minutes, g. b. l. had a $500 offer from mr. a, ready to come by. and 5 minutes later, mr. b just had to have the bike for $750. and thus g.b.l. told mr. a that the price was now $850. so mr. a confirmed that he'd match that offer, while mr. b dropped out. but then mr. c pops up: "will buy now no questions asked $1,500" and of course, g.b.l. will take mr. c's offer any day of the week. but mr. c can't commit to show up until the weekend - almost a week later. that's fine with her. mr. a, however, soon gets an email with the new $1,500 price. mr. a can match it. but mr. a drops off the face of the earth come his appointment time the next day. so she tries to get mr. c back, who confirms for that weekend...then drops off the face of the earth too. the day after mr. c. misses his appointment, mr. a gets back in touch with our greedy bicycle-owning friend, who apologies for his "family emergency." he makes an appointment for the weekend after. ...and mr. a misses that appointment too. in the meantime, mr. b wants to know if she'll do his $750, as the "ad still appears to be up." ...and mr. b doesn't show up for *his* appointment. and thus begins a vicious circle of emails from bicycle lady to mr. a, b, and c, as she desperately tries to get at least one sucker with more money than brains to her doorstep, following three weeks of runaround. of course, nobody ever replies - and by this point, no *real* buyers from craigslist are willing to bother with her nonsense either. and so the bike disappears off craigslist. but almost exactly a year later, g.b.l. posts the bike back up. same seller name, new pictures, nothing done to improve the bike's condition. the asking price is a flat $500. thus i emailed her from my original address (as myself), just to be a pest: "remember me, lady? when you want to talk about that $200 price again, give me a call. maybe you'll actually get to sell it this time." rimshot.so, my work is pretty relaxed about theft. we trust each other not to take anything without asking first, and that extends to food. we're all adults and we know better than to steal. i only lock my locker so a customer can't wander in and take something, not because i'm worried about my coworkers. anyway, we had a food thief crop up. it was becoming irritating. and then a coworker had a brilliant plan. she brought an extra sausage biscuit to work and left it on the break room table, as if she was going to come back and eat it later. however, what she didn't tell anyone until later was that she had gotten a bottle of a (dog chewing deterrent) bitter spray off the sales floor and sprayed the sausage patty with it before wrapping everything back up. around an hour later, there was a glorious moment when someone on the cleaning crew emerged from the break room coughing and gagging and making the most awful faces. that shit is potent. and that person is down a job.when i was 16, a guy in my chemistry class (in the year above and a bit of a gossiper) was telling a bunch of people that i'd slept with some guy also in the year above. it was untrue, so when i found out, i calmly told him that it wasn't true and that i'd appreciate it if he stopped saying it to people. i'd heard a few days later that he was still telling people and i was really mad, so i thought i'd start a rumour of my own. i had to choose a rumour that was ridiculous, but not so ridiculous that no-one would spread it, but not in a way that would have too negative an effect on his life. in the 2nd last class of the day (which almost entirely consisted of people from the year above), i said to a few people i sat with, "hey, did you hear that tim fingered a cat?" that was it! the rumour snowballed. teenagers love awkward sex stories and this one was just too awkward not to share. plus it was so bizarre that most people would know that it wasn't true, so no-one would call animal protection on him. at the end of the day i was walking home with a friend who had heard from loads of the other people in the upper class about this rumour. i didn't even tell her it was me so that it couldn't be traced back. kids joked about it for the rest of our school days (which was only a few months because they upper class graduated after that school year). it morphed into "tim fingered his gran's cat" and people would poke him in the stomach singing "na na na na na na catman". i remember someone shouted it across the social area one day and he exclaimed to a bunch of us "i don't even know where this came from!" and i kept a wry smile on my face. i went home last christmas (then aged 22) and someone said they'd seen tim catman. i'm glad to hear it stuck.my roommate threw a huge party in our room while i was out with friends and, when she was super drunk, spilled shitty beer all over my childhood teddy bear and threw him out. every morning since i've been turning her alarm off, right after she sets it, while she's brushing her teeth before going to bed. she's missed her last four 9 am classes (officially lowering her grade to a c), thinks her phone is broken, and is about to spend a shit ton of money she doesn't have on a new one. that's what you get for messing with larry beary, fucker. edit: holy shit, gold and this is basically my fourth ever post to reddit. i love you, random stranger.so i am a bouncer (username relevant). backstory: i transferred to a private school in 6th grade. because i was the new kid, i got picked on a lot. i mean a lot. i admit, i was kind of dorky and chubby, but not so much as to earn this kind of taunting. my bullying was spearheaded by this one kid. we'll call him seth. seth reminds me of cartman from south park, but not funny. just mean. he would get all of his little cocksucker friends and follow me around at lunch calling me names, pushing me, making me feel like shit. even the teachers wouldn't do anything about it because seth's parents were very powerful and long time friends of this school. i only had one friend the entire year i was there because of him, then i transferred because i was being bullied so hard. present day: i am a bouncer at the local bar in college. proof: i have outgrown my dorky and chubby stage. i was the team captain of the football and powerlifting teams. i won a national championship in powerlifting, and was an all district offensive lineman in high school and played d1 football for a little while. i am currently 6'5 240 lbs. long story short, im a big powerful dude. heres proof, me deadlifting 606lbs at 18yo at the national powerlifting meet: so anyways, im working on a normal night at the bar. making sure everything is going smoothly when who would walk in but seth. seth has gotten fat. seth is drunk. seth is not doing well. i tried to be professional about it and just ignore him like i didn't recognize him. a little while later seth stumbles over to me and says "hey! i remember you! we went to school together! it's me, seth!" i responded saying "oh yeah, good to see you dude, blah blah blah" he said some more drunken banter and went off to play pool. im above throwing him out for something he did 10 years ago. well about an hour later seth is shithoused. and he doesn't like that he's losing pool. so he starts sticking his finger into the face of the guy he's playing and starts yelling at this guy that he's gonna whoop his ass and whatnot. i looked at my coworker and said i got this one. i walked up to seth and said "hey man, i think it's about time that you leave." seth looked at me and said "fuck you, bitch! i aint leaving!" i grabbed him by his collar and said "that wasn't a request" seth turns to me and says "you aint gonna do shit! youre still a bitch like you always were!" so then seth decides it would be a good idea to swing his pool stick at my head. i caught it. i thought right after "holy shit that was the coolest thing ive ever done in my life. okay, now time to bounce this fucker" he has attempted assault towards me, so legally i can hit back. i take my hand off the pool stick and uppercut this mother fucker off the ground. as he's laying there i grab him by his collar and start to drag him to the door. he comes to and squirms his way out of his shirt and stands up. i see my fellow bouncers come to help me and i hold up my hand to stop them. i want this asshole by myself. seth runs at me and tries to tackle me. i step sideways and send him careening into a trash can. "you're not gonna win this fight fatass!" i yell as he gets up. this is where shit gets real. seth stands up and pulls a knife out of his pocket. this has never happened to me, but luckily i have knife on me at all times, so i pull mine out as well. we stand there for a few seconds when a police officer walks in to do his routine check of the bar. i know this officer fairly well as he comes to the bar often on his off days. the officer pulls out his taser and screams "drop the weapon!" seth does not comply. so the cop tazes his ass right there in front of god and everybody. he drops like the fatass bitch he is and gets arrested for armed assault. they run him through the system and it turns out that seth is on probation! uh oh! so seth gets hauled off to jail, and the police ask me a few questions about the situation. everyone in the bar agrees with my story and there is a security tape to reinforce my story. the court date hasn't been set yet, but i have to go and state my story as a witness or victim or whatever i am against ole seth. i guess i'm not a bitch anymore eh seth? hope y'all enjoyed the story! tl;dr **elementary school bully comes into the bar i work at. tries to fight me. i kick his ass then he gets tazed, arrested, and lots of jail time.** edit: hot damn! i woke up and l was popular! thanks for all of the support guys! i'm getting a lot of ideas for new weapons by the way. i had just always normally carried a knife and that was the first time i'd ever used it. i'll update this when the court date comes out and they notify me what i need to do. and if i can get the video, then i'll upload it and let y'all see what i did. edit 2: and no, i'm sorry, i've never seen roadhouse. please forgive me. edit 3: for the naysayers, sometimes things like this actually happen in real life. that cop saved my life, and i'm forever grateful that he walked in when he did. and if you still don't believe me, this is my first time posting in this sub, and really its the only time i've ever gotten revenge on someone in my life. this was all a few years back but about the same time of year. looking back, i was an easy target for bullies back then, but i had never thought that i would be bullied by a girl. let's call her beth. beth was the type of person that would cut to the front of the lunch line because her time was more important than everyone else's. she was the kind of person that would mock you if you got a bad grade. she was just an all-around douchebag that felt that the world owed her something. and something about me had pissed her off. she was a senior and i was a junior, and as a result we didn't come in contact very often. but whenever she saw my in the hallway or in the one class we shared, she would make a point of insulting me, knocking my head around, or calling me names. at my school, the period you had gym could change for some people halfway through the year. i had overheard that beth's gym period was changing, and that she would be coming to the bio room during the same period that i was there. the bio teacher was a really nice woman who let my friends and i hang out there while she was on her lunch break. so there would be no adult in this room, and i would be almost alone with beth. i knew that since there was no adult around, she would take the opportunity to mess with me. the next day, i went to the bio room early. i hid my phone behind a bunch of textbooks on a shelf, and turned on the video camera. then i sat in a chair where i could be seen by the camera, and waited. when she came in, she started mocking me as i had expected. called me a shithead and a social reject. asked me why i was in here all alone and said that i had no friends. messed up my hair and hit me on the back of my head. but i was playing the part of the victim: i didn't say a word. after she had sufficiently tormented me, she logged onto a computer and started doing some work. i went over to the shelf and took out a textbook, so that i would have an excuse to retrieve my phone. i looked at the video that night. it made me sad, but i knew that i would have the upper hand in the end. the only problem was that the audio was shit because the camera was far away, so i decided i would do an audio recording the next day. i sat in the same seat, but i had my phone on the table in front of me, with the screen off but the voice recording app activated. the audio was much better this time, you could clearly hear what she was saying to me. now for the revenge. i knew that if i went to the principal, probably nothing would happen and i wouldn't be allowed to stay in that room at lunch anymore. but, it just so happened that beth had applied for early admission at a very prestigious, very expensive university. this college required that, if you applied for early admission, you must not apply to any other schools. it also stated that when you apply for early admission, you waive any possibility of getting student aid. it was her dream school, and her daddy was going to pay for the whole thing. pretty much everyone that applies for early admission to this school gets in, because the college is making bank off of you. so when beth got her acceptance letter, she was bragging to everyone that she had gotten into this prestigious university. and that's when i decided to call the college's admission's center. i had uploaded the video + the audio recording to youtube under a private link. i told the admissions officer that beth bullying me on a daily basis and that being around her was a living nightmare. i had him view the video, and he said he would discuss a course of action with the other admissions officers. beth skipped school for 4 days in shame. when she came back, she was bawling her eyes out to anyone that listened. she was devastated. nothing had ever gone wrong in her life up to this point, certainly nothing this important. some people have to learn the hard way in life. i never told her that it was me, and i don't know what happened to her. i hope no one ever has to go through what i went through. bullying sucks. thanks for listening.broke my car on holiday and insurance arranged for a rental to get home. that was the limit of the insurance cover 'cos im a cheapskate and i always assumed i could use the wife's car. unfortunatly that was in for a major service arrainged for whilst we we were away. total bummer. so i asked to extend the hire for a week self pay. no problems, week went by and the rental car was picked up from home. then the rental company billed me to fill the tank, *with 3 liters of fuel*. plus $50 surcharge. *i lived within 500m of a gas station.* i phoned the hire car company but they completly rejected my disputing the charge. "their word against mine" . "full means full". total stonewall. even started to mention that if i wanted to take it any further that i should get my lawyer to write to their lawyers. i phoned the insurance company, went over the story and explained that the only way i could have had a fuller tank was if they had picked it up at the gas pump itself. the operative called over a manager and they *suddenly got very interested*. further managers were called and a copy of my bill for 3 litres was requested. insurance company phoned back a week later and said the charge had been dropped. also because of my phone call their accountants had gone back over a year's worth of using that hire company and were currently in dispute over many *thousand$* worth of "irregularities that legaly we can't mention that may or may not be related to your complaint" so, not directly my 'pro-revenge', but certainly a good level of smug satisfaction hire car company? *feel my wrath.*tl;dr: fuck boy is a fuck boy and makes my job a lot harder when i depend on him. sexually assaults a girl, gets fucked up, gets fired, goes to jail. titties. so, i am a bouncer. proof: username. backstory: a few months ago we hired this dude. we all call him ralph because he has a tattoo of the ralph lauren horse on his chest where the logo would be on a shirt. this dude is a fuck boy. he got cut from every single fraternity in rush because he sold drugs and was forceful with girls. even the douche bag fraternity that i've written about in my previous stories said "nah man, you're a fucking dick." he also got kicked off the cheerleading squad because he always started fights. ralph is the kind of guy at a party that won't shut the fuck up about how he used to fight mma and how many hot girls he's fucked. now, all of this i can deal with. i don't give a shit what you do on your own time, as long as you do your job at work and don't make my life harder. ralph didn't do his job, and that's what pissed me off. when we were supposed to be watching the crowd he would slink off to go dance with girls or get drunk in the bathroom. so it would be me and just one other guy managing almost 600 people. he would never break up fights, or pull beers from underage kids. i would come back in from breaking up a fight and asked him why he didn't jump in and he would brush me off with a "fuck you." he was literally useless. to add the icing on the cake, he would constantly be bitching about not getting paid enough, and he would rat anyone else out that complained. he made my job infinitely harder. after complaining to the managers to get him to do something else and nothing happening, i had about had enough of ralph. what happened: i was working the floor when ralph was off. ralph came in blacked the fuck out. now remember when i said ralph was rough with women? well he was a bit too rough this night with the wrong group of girls. where i work, there are a lot of foreigners that go to the local college. most of them come to play sports. a frequent group that came into the bar was the women's volleyball team. i'm a big dude, i was an offensive lineman in college and a champion powerlifter. these girls dwarf me. they're all around 6'7 and above with the most muscled legs i've ever seen on women. plus they're all from like germany and lithuania and those european countries where they yodel and eat bricks while still remaining attractive. well ralph decided one night that he wanted to climb those legs whether they wanted him to or not. i watched him from across the bar. he stumbled his way over to the group of amazons and started talking them up. from the get go they were not interested. he wouldn't take no for an answer though. he was starting to get a little grabby and i started to lumber over there to tell him to fuck off when it happened. ralph had struck out with all of his other tactics so all of the sudden he reaches under this girl's dress and grabs her crotch. he uppercunted her, hard. before i could move this girl delivers an elbow to ralphs face that would make the rock do a double take. as ralph grabbed his nose and yelled, the girl started yelling something in german at her friends and holding her private area. it was like watching the discovery channel. and i always root for the predator. this team of beautiful scyscraper women descended upon ralph. they were fucking livid. they started beating the shit out of ralph. and at that moment i remembered that i was little sore from leg day, so i took my sweet ass time walking over there. it wasn't more than a few seconds, but it was enough. when i broke up the fight ralph had a clearly broken nose, claw marks on his face and neck, his shirt was ripped in half, and he was covered in mud. now what i could've done was taken him out the side, cleaned him up, and gotten him a ride home. those girls fucked him up and he got his just desserts. but i remembered how hard he had made my job for months by not doing his share. i picked him up and paraded his ass through the bar and straight to the cop on duty outside. i explained to the officer that ralph had sexually assaulted a girl inside and she reacted in self defense. my boss came running up and i explained to him what happened and he fired ralph on the spot. ralph got taken to jail and the girl whose cooch he grabbed is pressing charges against him. that's what you get for being a fuck boy, ralph. you shouldn't make your coworker's jobs harder and tell them to fuck off. i didn't appreciate that.this happened a long time ago when i worked on cruise ships. we always had dick heads from the internet forum "cruise critic". this guy had printed a sign "i am a cruise critic" and put it on his cabin door. basically, these people expect special service and complain about absolutely everything to get free upgrades, drinks or even a free cruise. as soon as he got on board he complained about his cabin and was upgraded to a balcony suite to shut him up. it still wasn't good enough. he kept complaining that his tv reception wasn't crystal clear. we visited his cabin and saw no issue with the image, in fact it was better than most tvs as it was close to the amplifier for that section. after replacing the tv anyway &amp; explaining that we are tracking a geostationary tv satellite on a moving ship with a gyro stabilised dish and millions of dollars of above and below decks equipment he still kept complaining that the picture wasn't as clear as his tv at home. after 48 hours of him complaining and demanding a complimentary cruise (he was already cruising for free after complaining so much about his last cruise) we planned our revenge. when we knew he was at his allocated dining time my av team showed up in the cabin &amp; gathered a team of engineers, fitters and electricians. we stripped all of the wall &amp; roof panels and pulled out all the av wiring, dumping a buttload of dust everywhere before downing tools &amp; calling it a day. after the guest &amp; his wife returned after dinner and a show he called the front desk furious that his cabin had been turned into an uninhabitable construction site. it was explained to him that we listened to his demands and as such were re-wiring his cabin to ensure he has crystal clear tv reception just like he asked. he was advised would take a few days (the rest of the cruise) as it is a complex job. he went quiet before asking to be moved to another cabin. he was moved to a cabin smaller than his original cabin and above the bow thrusters. he was not heard from again the rest of the cruise. edit: thanks for all the comments, i haven't been on reddit for a few days so coming back to this was a surprise. i will do my best to reply to some of the comments.edit: for all those referring to me as a "he" ... think again. throwaway for privacy reasons. i own a construction equipment dealership, specializing in excavation gear. the main brand i carry has dealership "every 2 blocks", to the point that there are over 800 in the lower 48 states alone. they do this to keep prices down, because dealers have to compete with each other. my story starts in 2005. business was booming, i was making 15% on all new gear, and selling it by the truck load. i was one of the largest dealers in the u.s., and i was the largest in my region. the factory provides us with the machine, as well as accessories for it. as a dealer, we are not allowed to sell non authorized after market accessories if the machine itself is being financed through the factory. i had many complaints about the lowering quality in accessories made by the factory, to the point that i was no longer comfortable putting my name anywhere near it. i asked a friend of mine that deals only in used excavators where he gets all his gear, and he introduced me to a factory in china. long story short, i go visit the supplier, and impressed, and from that day on only use after market accessories. i get around the financing issue by selling all machines with no gear, which means no quick couplers, buckets, or hydraulic thumbs, and getting that financed, then the customer has to pay cash for the accessories. if that is an issue, i have a secondary bank that will finance them, just not at 0%. in addition to a better quality product, i now can provide a much better price. for example, a 24" dig bucket would typically sell for about $1,500, and we would buy it for $1,200. i'll now sell it for $700, and pay my man in china about $300. this of course helped me get more deals, which would have gone to other dealers. now instead of being able to call up another dealer and take a machine in on trade if i don't have it, i can only get them from the factory, meaning instead of needing to hold $1,000,000-$1,500,000 of inventory, i was having to hold about double that. at one point, i sell a machine in to the heart of another dealers territory, non restricted i may add, and the customer turns out to be the dealerships owners neighbor. this pisses off the other dealership to no end, and he finds out where my price advantage is coming from. his neighbor tells him that he didn't pay for the accessories separate, and he takes this as he financed it all. the other dealer turns me in to the factory, and implies that i've always used after market gear, and that i've always financed it through the factory, neither of which are true. he made enough waves that the factory sent people out to inventory my lot, to make sure i actually had all the machines on my lot that i claim i do, and to make sure all the accessories i claim are theirs, actually are. they audit my sales for the past 8 or 9 years of our business relationship, and going through everything with a fine tooth comb. the kicker? they don't let me use any financing they offer while they're searching for a non existant error/scam on my part. after about 2 months of having 2 or 3 men going through all of our paperwork, inspecting every signature, and calling over 150 different customers, i get the green light to keep selling, and they leave. unfortunately, this turns what should have been the height of the season, in to one of the worst quarters i've ever had. tldr, i get an advantage, and another dealer tattle tails and messes with my livelihood. time for the revenge in our 2008, as you may be aware, the world ended. dealers were getting ready to close down. i went from making 15% on the new machines to making 5%, and i went from over doubling my money on each accessory, to selling them at $100 over cost. i'm proud to say i didn't lose a single penny during this. i eventually had to cut back my sales staff, but we never lost a cent. anyway, dealers were trying to get rid of their inventory, because they didn't want to have to pay for it when the flooring expired. well, flooring started expiring, and the dealers didn't have networks in place to be able to sell them far enough, or suppliers in place to sell them cheep enough, so they were getting stuck. at this point, i was selling everything cheep, but was still selling it, and still making at least $2,000 a sale, so i didn't run out of flooring on a single item. once a dealer ran out of flooring, and couldn't pay for their gear, the factory would be responsible for trucking it back to their distribution centers, and then they would be stuck with all the gear. i struck a deal with the factory, and the short version is, the other dealers were now getting free extended flooring, and weren't paying for their machines. if i needed it, or could sell it, they would pay my shipping expense, so i could sell it. the other dealers were mostly fine with this, because i was freeing them of hundreds of thousands of debt every month. well, most dealers loved this. out of the 7 or so dealers in my area, i would only take trades from 6 of them. that's right, i stuck the dealer that turned me in with every single item he had. he tried to get me to take them, literally offering my thousands of dollars to do so, so he wouldn't have to either pay the factory, or lose his contract with them. well, it came to the point that our state had about $2,500,000 worth of inventory on hand, across all 7 dealers. guess what? nearly half of that was all on dealer 7, and his inability to sell them, and inability to pay for them, cost him his contract with the factory, and his dealership as a hole. once the started turning around, i had the chance to actually buy his location, building, land, shop, etc, but turned it down. another dealership did buy it, and actually hired him on as a manager. after a few months though, he got fired, as he just couldn't close a deal anymore. true tldr. fuck with me, and take food off of my table, i'll destroy the business that you've ran for decades, that was founded by your father. edit: sorry if this is a bit hard to read, it took a few drinks to be able to feel privat enough to post this, and it's pretty late where i am right now. i'll answer any questions in the comments, if it was a little confusing.this is my first post in pro-revenge. i say that more for my own records than anything, but i feel it's a good opener. nice and neutral. this story starts off with me, sir pahnkayx of the breakfast-table, moving out of an 'emergency' apartment and into slum-lord's offered domicile. i found the apartment on craigslist; the rent was pricey but the accomodations looked really nice. the building was old: she was built in a late 19th century beaux arts style architecture typical of former banking towns in massachusetts. she was also "conveniently located" next to the only regional hospital thus ensuring i'd have ambulances going past several times an hour; sirens and lights like it was the end of days. i now know never to rent 'conveniently' near a hospital. i was very satisfied with the initial walk-through. the apartment had high ceilings, wood floors, and framed doorways. it was all very nice, superficially. i was hooked. i also was in dire straits with my then-roommate who was going through some sort of weird relationship induced psychosis. all in all, having this fall in my lap as it did seemed awesome. i had a place, a 2- 1. top floor (of a walk up but who cares?), i could afford it, etc. then the trouble starts. the building's electrical is from 1920. none of the outlets are grounded (that means two prong holes instead of the normal three like we use in the 21st century). there is also a premium on these outlets as there is only one outlet in each of the 6 rooms (including the bathroom and kitchen). this is a huge deal because i work from home and the computer (and towers) draws a lot of electricity for my work. more than the bullshit geriatric illegal wiring could handle. their cost-cutting measures were cutting into my earnings. on top of it all, the fusebox was actually a tubes-and-screws number. fuck tubes-and-screws. the rent was 1,100 dollars for an apartment fitted for wilson era war-policies. i start submitting complaints. the breaker box was in the basement, behind a locked door only the management could get to because the whole 24 apartment building was run through one breaker box (for those who know electrical you'll see where this is going). this was a huge problem. in summer, you had the option of television or fan. winter; computer or space-heater. if you felt adventurous you could plug something else in, or turn on a light; but then the whole apartment would be plunged into darkness and you'd have to wait for hours and hours until it was convenient for one of those stooges to come over and reset the breaker box in the basement. then they had the audacity to charge you money for the service. the complaints continue. they start getting surly. they start getting aggressive. they start showing up on the first of the month to collect in person with the maintenance guys as back up. they start sending me threatening letters accusing me of all sorts of insanity because i had the brass balls to call them on their scam. this went on for several months before i was stranded over a weekend with no electrical. that was the breaking point. i called an electrician to come and look at my house. he tested the outlets, everything. he wasn't impressed, but this was the start. he told me this was basically a fire trap. this was especailly worrying as i lived on the 4rth floor of a walk-up. i then called the fire department, who directed me to the health department. the health department came over and did a walk through. he wrote up a work order for the city wiring inspector. the wiring inspector came over, took one look at my fuse box and wrote a work order for a replacement breaker box. this means the fuse box needs to be torn out, replaced with a breaker box, the breaker line needs to be installed (in this case that meant drilling through 5 floors and laying the line since it didn't exist, an expense of several, several thousand dollars). i had a breaker box, but it's not over. the wiring inspector was so appalled by what he saw he requested to see the rest of the building. turns out that the whole building is way the fuck out of code and every single apartment needs to be renovated at the cost of a couple hundred grand. i then used this and sued for back rent. i got the whole year of my time there free since the place was so out of code and slum-lord still had to repair the building on his own dime. tl;dr they didn't deal with me, so they dealt with the state. i won, though. edit: after reading through some of the comments i've found i wasn't completely clear. no, i do not live there anymore. edit ii: i got about 800 dollars in back rent which is equal to about 10% of my rent a month, but then the courts also voided the rent i payed him for my time there so it was a year +$800usd. . so, at the end of the day the 800 went back to my lawyer basically and i got the year for free. edit iii: yes i got payed. fuck.about a year ago i finally decided to get out on my own for good and true because living with other people causes me unending stress, but the only way to get into a place quickly was to take a unit on the edge of the not-so-nice district of town. i figured since there was a police station literally across the road i would be safe. needless to say, i don't live there any more. at first everything seemed fine. i got all my stuff moved in, started learning how to cook stuff more complicated than chicken soup, it was all good. most everyone in my row of units tended to keep themselves to themselves. apart from my neighbour on one side having noisy shower sex at two in the morning, everyone left me alone. except this one dude. he was in the unit on the other side from the shower sex people, and he was, in retrospect, way too enthusiastic to have a single lady moving in next door. he was constantly coming over just to 'say hi' and 'see how i was settling in' and often had to be physically pushed out the door. he often stank of booze and took advantage of the summer weather and sealed windows (no shit, this place had locked windows and tenants didn't get keys to them) to come wandering in when i was working. he drove me nuts, but seemed relatively harmless. the first sign that something wronger than the guy being completely unable to get the message to fuck off and leave me alone was when the cops came around to try and serve a warrant on him. i don't know exactly what came of that, but he swore blind they'd actually been after the previous tenant and he hadn't come out because he was sleeping. which in retrospect i was a fucking idiot for believing, because i am a heavy sleeper and they woke /me/ up. then he asked if he could use my computer to check his email because his was 'in the shop'. i let him because it got him to shut up and let me work faster. i didn't think much of this until one night when he and the guy from the unit on the other side of him got a bit drunk and came over asking to watch top gear. the other guy was very nice and friendly, even drunk, but he got louder and more and more raucous until he crossed the line and made some jokes about raping the other guy. i told him not to make those jokes and to get out, and while he was leaving i heard the words "i'm not fucking joking, i'll rape him if he doesn't shut the fuck up." next day i spoke to the other dude and found out his computer had been confiscated by the police. the neighbour then promptly disappeared for a month, and i had the real estate agents asking me if i had any idea where he'd gone and why he wasn't paying rent. he then promptly reappeared, paid his owing rent, and went around boasting that he'd had so many parking tickets they'd arrested him. i don't know much about the law but i know you don't get a month in jail here for tickets. i still would have let it pass, except i came down with the gastric flu and was very, very, very sick for a week, and every time the neighbour turned up i had to tell him to go away. this week was also the week a tornado hit upstate and the heavy winds caused a lot of property damage all over our city and between the noise and the flu i didn't get more then about ten minutes sleep for the entire week. the neighbour turned up at 11pm one night demanding to let me in, and in my miserable, sick, sleep-deprived state, i told him to fuck right off. the next day the seat and tyres of my motorcycle were cut to ribbons. even though the police and i both knew damn well who did it, without any physical evidence or a witness they couldn't actually do anything. revenge was now going to be mine. first i let neighbour use my computer again. he had a habit of not signing out of his email, so instead of doing what i usually did and signing out for him, i left him logged in, and called an old school friend. said school friend is now a cop. i explained the situation to him, and as soon as i named names he told me to stay logged in and he'd be right over. two hours later my computer was being examined by a police department technician who downloaded pretty much everything the guy had ever written to anyone. i didn't see much but what i did see was fucking sick. i then gave statements to a few officers, and found out that when neighbour was in jail for 'parking tickets' he was actually in trouble for drugging and trying to sexually assault a girl in a local bar and had only gotten out because his mum had posted bail, despite him being a registered sex offender. the prison he'd been in didn't even have a low security wing. he'd obviously lied to the real estate agents about what was actually going on because any criminal record beyond parking or speeding tickets made them reject you for rental. neighbour was arrested again for something they'd wanted to pin on him but hadn't been able to until they got the emails, i got subpoaenaed as a witness, and he got carted off to await trial. and then, just to add insult to injury, my policeman friend called the real estate agents about his record and he got evicted. i saw him in court last week when i gave my testimony, and he lost his shit when he realised i was the one who'd finally gotten the police the evidence they needed to send him down. i then got the glorious pleasure of hearing him sentenced to ten years. tl;dr: criminal neighbour knifes my motorbike when i won't let him visit at 11pm, i give police access to his email and he gets arrested and loses everything. edit: i ran into the lawyer who was prosecuting the case just now at the shops, looks like the jerk's getting deported back to his home country to serve his term there. hah. that's fucking beautiful. edit 2: the prosecutor didn't tell me where he's being deported to because it's actually against the law for him to reveal most case details, however judging by the soon-to-be-flying-the-fuck-outta-here bastard's accent, he's gonna be freezing his bollocks off somewhere germanic. ouch.*apologies in advance for length* in my senior year of college, only a year ago, i was required to take a diversity class for my major. i wasn't interested in jewish studies, asian literature, or anything else that they offered. my girlfriend had taken a sociology class which qualified called socy 325 "sociology of gender." she said it was really interesting and not at all what a stereotypical womans studies class might be like. so i thought what the heck, i'll give it a shot. unfortunately the thought provoking, discussion instigating professor that she had was not the same one that i would be having. unbeknowst to me there were two different professors and i was in the section with the awful one. this professor had an agenda and made damn sure that anyone in her class would have to agree or get out. any dissent was quashed. over the course of the semester, it was very clear that despite the class being about a very thought provoking subject, in which there are many different theories and ideas, to her there was a right answer and a wrong answer to every question that may come up. i love playing devil's advocate, so whenever there is a flaw in someone's argument, even if i agree with the argument, i'll speak up and try to get whoever is making the argument prove their point (i was a criminal justice major, "beyond a reasonable doubt" was my standard to get me to agree with you one way or another.) so we butted heads a lot. it came to a head when we read chapters from *the myth of the vaginal orgasm* by anna koedt, a classic feminist novel in which she, among other things, claims that woman are indoctrinated into thinking that sex is penetrative sex is pleasurable when in fact it doesnt do anything for them, and can't feel any stimulation when penetrated. when i read this, i laughed out loud. it just sounds like such bullshit that i couldnt believe we were taking it seriously. the author does make some good points in the book, such as debunking some freudian craziness, but that notion was laughable to me. when it came time to discuss it in class, i brought this up as total bs. i wish i had written it down at the time, because the back and forth was pure gold. i raised the point that another of our readings raised the point that some woman can and some woman cant orgasm from pure vaginal stimulation. koedt might have been one who couldnt, and since she was a sociologist not a researcher her views may have been skewed along those lines. my professor was arguing that koedt was right, and we had been assigned the other reading (a study by alfred kinsey, an early sex researcher) to prove that these other woman had adopted the ideology of the patriarchal society. if that was the case, i said, how can my girlfriend of 4 years have an orgasm when we have sex and her clit isnt being stimulated? obviously it was because she had adopted the ideology as well so that you could continue to have sex with her. so she was faking it? yes. even though i know she wasnt? she was lying to preserve your ego. so disregarding the fact that she had just called my girlfriend a liar, i brought up the point that lesbians use dildos on each other for sex as well. if they couldnt feel pleasure from that then what was the point? and on that note apparently i was going too far down the smut train (though she was perfectly happy talking about sex before) and she changed the subject. i think making a well thought out argument against her personal beliefs made me a marked man in her book, and she was determined to see me fail no matter what. luckily, in this class we only had three grades the whole year. a midterm, 25% of the grade, a final, 40% of the grade, and a final paper, 35%. the two tests were both multiple choice, and she couldn't skew my grade on them one way or the other. i did ok on them, a c and a b, and just needed a 70% on the final paper to pass the class. the paper's prompt was very open ended, basically any kind of gender studies research paper, so i decided to poke the bear. not the best idea on my part, but i decided to create a survey asking girls if they could have a vaginal orgasm, along with some other questions about sexuality and feminist sexuality theory. from the research i concluded that koedt was wrong, the kinsey experiment we read was outdated and wrong, and that females could in fact have a vaginal orgasm. alert the media! call a news conference! i had constructed my survey and distributed in a very statistically significant way, and had mounds of prior research to support my claims. despite all of this, my professor gave me a 60% on the paper on the basis that my survey had a bias, the research was insignificant, and my conclusions were improper for the data collected. she wouldnt budge, despite another professor who i had asked for help in constructing the survey speaking on my behalf. so the grade stayed, and i failed the class. luckily, in my university, there was a process to appeal a final grade. what happens is that the original paper or test is submitted to a panel of other professors in the department and they all grade it separately, and if the new average is very different from the original than it can be changed. the comments are also submitted, along with testimony from myself, anyone i want to have there, and the professor and anyone she wants to have there. so the board found that my paper was very well structured and i had effectively countered koedt's claims. they also agreed with my conclusion that the other study we looked at was outdated (they were sociology professors too, and knew all about the subject.) so after the professor who i had helping me talked to them, and i talked to them, my professor talked to them. the grade was changed, i got an a on the final and a b in the class. thank god, no more gender studies for me. the next semester, before i was going to graduate, i went to see the professor who had helped me. he had written a great recommendation for grad school and i had gotten into my first choice, and went to thank him. in the course of our discussion i brought up the other professor who we had shut down, and he gave me some great news. because the board had felt she graded me extremely unfairly, and on the basis of her own personal beliefs, they submitted the case to the dean of the college of behavioral sciences. it was not the first time that she had had complaints against her, and now with this hard evidence along with the findings of the other professors, she was fired! i had a big problem with her because academics should be unbiased, and discussion is healthy. the "my way or the highway" attitude is really bad especially for the gray area of gender studies. so while getting someone fired isnt really something to celebrate, i was glad that no more students would be subjected to her bullshit. **the happy:** years ago, i used to be married to she-who-must-not-be-named-(in-my-family). for the purposes of brevity, we shall call her alice. somewhat significant age gap when we got married: i was 27 and alice was 19 at the time. we had our share of ups and downs, and during one particularly hard time about a year after we got married, we were sunk in credit card debt and had to move in with her mother, who had a whole bunch of chronic medical problems and no insurance. stepdad is a shadetree mechanic (who was not bad at it, actually), but couldn't get regular work because he had medical problems all his own. move in, cut some costs, help family. it's the right thing to do, right? problem was, alice and i couldn't seem to both hold jobs at the same time. she would get laid off a week before i would start a new job, and vice-versa. after about 9 months of this, i was like, fuck it, imma get all the jobs. i get a job working weeknights. i get a weekend job. the temp service i signed up with was really aggressive and got me decent (weekday) jobs on a regular basis. only problem was, these jobs were over an hour away from her mom's and i'd be so dead tired from working, i'd crash at my brother's place which was 10 minutes away the next city over. i'd only be able to go home to see alice every few days, then have to get up a few hours later so i could beat the rush hour in to work. four months pass, and we find ourselves slowly inching from the red into the black. one day, alice lets me know that she got a job. it's about 20 minutes away, and only i have a (working) car. she has friends that can give her a ride when i'm not home, and i take her to work or pick her up every chance i get. this goes on for about a month. finally she says, "i think i need my own car." it's all good, she's an independent girl, and i can see how hard it is for her to be so dependent on other people. i do some quick math and figure it would take about four months for us to get enough money together to get a decent beater that won't die in a year. she nods her understanding. i see her disappointment, and my man-pride cannot take it. i level up and go beast mode. i start taking side jobs (mostly construction) with a friend of a friend who pays on a per-day basis to fill out the times when i have blanks on weekdays when the temp agency hasn't got anything for me and i pull double shifts for the weekend job. i sleep an average of four or five hours a day. three weeks later, i have purchased a car for her, a cute little 4x4 that i saw on craigslist. mechanically sound, but was dirty af. i park it at a friend's place and over the course of a week, give that grimy bastard the most comprehensive cleaning of its life. you could have eaten off the wheel wells, i shit you not. my good buddy nathan springs for some cheap but nice visuals (wheel paint, seat covers, floor mats, etc.) and we make it look even better. when we move it out of the garage, my friend's mom swears it *can't* be the same car and i have to prove it to her. i leave my car with nathan, and drive home in her car. timing is perfect. i'm about 10 minutes away from home when alice calls me on my cell. she wants to go get some groceries. i let her know i'll be there in a bit and park by the curb one house down. i knock on the door and tell her to come out so we can go. she steps out and looks around. "where's your car?" "left it at nathan's." "what did you drive?" "that." (i point at the car.) "whose car is that?" "yours." she takes a couple of seconds to process that single word. then, her jaw drops and alice runs back inside screaming "mom, insanern got me a car!" **the sad:** a couple of years go by. alice has learned how to use a manual transmission because her baby has one. between myself and her stepdad, alice has learned to change the oil herself, and even took an active part in replacing the brake pads and all four shock absorbers on her baby. she bathes her baby herself. she has learned to take care of her baby. mil's medical problems are mostly manageable with meds now, and stepdad is getting almost regular work thrown his way by friends and previous customers. we have moved out of her mom's place, and i'm only working two jobs now. credit card debt is down by 80%. alice also has a steady job, and is thinking of going back to school. [and then i find out she is cheating on me.]( fool me once, shame on you. fool me twice, shame on me. there is no third time. there must be payback. my man-pride demands it. **the mad:** a week after the nuke drops on our marriage, i've worked out the problem. she's already gotten her stuff and moved out by then. i call her up to meet. lunchtime, her work. just to talk, i say. there's a little pseudo-eco-industrial picnic area right by the building she works at, and there's a fair amount of foot traffic (ie, witnesses). there's some chitchat, and she makes a vague appeal to work things out by dragging my dead dad into it. hellz naw. you don't have the right to do that. you had a one percent chance, but that just flat out dropped it to zero. i cut her off mid-sentence. "i'm taking the car. your car." "wut?" "the pink slip is in my name. i'm taking back my property right now. and if you don't hand over the keys right now, i'm going to report it stolen to the police." "but you gave that car to *me*!" i'd been talking in a normal, conversational tone up until this time. her betrayal rams into my chest for the thousandth time. my voice hardens. "i didn't give the car to you. **i gave the car to *my wife*.**" her brain still isn't firing on all cylinders. she asks, "b-but how will i get to work?" " . . . get your boyfriend to drive you." i'm still looking at her. her face goes slack as she realizes that i am. not. kidding. i take the keys, get into the her baby, and drive off. i look at her as we pass. she still has the same look on her face. and i drive all the way home with the biggest shit-eating grin on mine. **tl;dr** - i buy my wife a car. she cheats on me. we break up. i take the car back. p.s. - goddamn, that was cathartic. this is the best i've felt in over a decade. p.p.s. - car stuck around for another year before i sold it to my buddy, nathan. i only wanted $100 for it, and he wanted to pay blue book. we compromised; i sold it for the same price i bought it. (which was way cheaper than blue book.) p.p.p.s - thanks for the gold, anonymous redditor! edit - as suggested, did some name changing to make it flow better. also, not their real names. (there's always that one person . . . )a little back story first. my older brother adopted me when i was 14, i lived with him, his wife, and her two children (one a couple months older than me, the other a year older). i have never gotten along with the younger one, his mother and father went through a divorce and both parents spoiled the hell out of him. his father owned several businesses making around a million a year, so he's your typical entitled douchebag, who has always clashed with me, someone who grew up poor. this is the type of dude that kicked a dog we all raised from a 4 week old puppy because she was excited to see him after not seeing him for six months and she was jumping around. he's the type of dude that has ruined thanksgiving because the milk was 2% instead of 1% by screaming, yelling, and cussing everyone out, at the age of 29. now on to the story: i was on a phone plan with his mother, but i lost my job, unable to pay the last $60 i owe her, but we had worked it out that i would pay her back on thanksgiving by installing a stereo my brother's (her husbands) new pickup. a little over a week ago, i was picking up fallout 4 for a friend who was at work at the gamestop in the local mall (nephew works across the little walkway and saw me walk in from outside where he was walking in to work.). while i'm in line, he comes in, cuts in front of everyone and cusses me out saying i shouldn't be buying games when i owe his mom money. i told him he needed to back the hell off and not talk about shit he knew nothing about. he kept going on and on, running his mouth. i got my friends game and walked out with him following me out the door. when i got to the door, he stopped ranting and went back to work with a smug look on his face. i lived with this guy for years so i know him very well. when i hopped in my car, i realized he had parked in front of me and my dash cam was on. he sells weed out of his truck to subsidize his low wages at the mall, and i remembered that he always showed up to work early to so. i rewound my dash cam, and sure enough, you could clearly see him sell weed. i sent an email with the video of him selling the weed to the management of the mall from a new email address as a "concerned citizen". three days later while talking to my brother, he told me that my nephew got fired from his job and banned from the mall property. my response, "that sucks." enjoy not getting that unemployment check asshole. edit: just a bit of a preface, besides the landlord trying to underpay me, he also sent me emails prior to the court date saying that i have no chance of winning, and should settle for under 50% of the total cost. claims he has never lost in court. waited in the court lobby for nearly two hours. landlord sat close-ish to me and kept trying to make stupid banter/small talk with me. i ignored him completely. finally get pulled into the court room after the office was supposed to have closed (about 4:00pm). the judge asks if there is anything she can do to help us reach an amicable settlement without having to go through the judicial process. i explain that i attempted that before any court proceedings, and landlord would not accept my offer. his counter-offer was unreasonably low. unfortunately we have to do the thing. we are sworn in. judge asks for a copy of the lease. she reads off the monthly rent amount, then the security deposit amount. asks me when i sent it to landlord originally, i tell her around july 4th, 2011. landlord confirms to her that he received it. judge asks landlord what he did with the security deposit. "i deposited it", he says. judge explains that she needs details. what financial institution, type of account, etc. "i just deposited it into my wells fargo (or whatever he said) account." judge lets out an audible sigh. "mr. tenant, where you told what financial institution this was deposited in?". i explain that i was never informed. another audible sigh. judge asks if she can speak with each of us separately. we agree, landlord goes first. about ten minutes later, they return, and i go with the judge. i'm ready to explain all of the claims he made as to why he was keeping the money, show her all of the evidence i've documented and brought with me (brought 3 folders each with their own copies of various things). judge closes the door to her office and explains that he is going to give me the entirety of the deposit. she explains that since he never disclosed the location of the deposit, or put it in an interest bearing account, he essentially had no case. she explains that the **pennsylvania** landlord-tenant act of 1951 is very specific and the landlord has a lot of things he needs to follow. i ask if that means he will also be paying for the court fees (about $133). she tells me that i can request that, but since this will technically be a 'settlement' (she was being nice and not putting in a judgment against him, but he still had to pay the full amount) she didn't ask him about that. i suggest that he pay half (as a sign of good faith, and also i wanted this shit to be done with). she thinks this is very reasonable. we go back into the court room, and she explains that landlord has agreed to pay the full amount, and also informs him that he will be paying half of the court fees. the judge asks how long i'd like to give him. she suggests 3 business days. i offer a full week (because i'm way too fucking nice). landlord offers to write the check right then and there. he does. i receive the check, and i return to him the un-cashed check he originally tried to return me (less than 25% of the initial deposit). in my final moments of glory, the judge again suggests to landlord that he read up on the **pennsylvania** landlord-tenant act of 1951, as being a landlord isn't something you should half-ass. i pipe up and explain to him that i had already done him the favor, and pull out the entire agreement which i had already printed up (and highlighted the relevant sections). i tell him he can keep it, as i've already read it. the judge says we are free to go. today was a good day.while [reading the news]( this morning about how cheating is rampant in india, it brought back a memory of my time in college... our story begins in a little school called suny-it in upstate new york about 5-6 years ago. state run school that they tried to peddle as an "institute" of technology. this was a school that only had wireless in one building out of six, had it equipment from as far back as 1972 according to the datestamps, and professors who were uncaring part-timers, or in my case, senile. i was in what was called an "experimental course" which meant it would count towards my degree, but would be non-transferable. we were required to take at least four of these "493" classes over the course of our attendance in order to graduate. it was bullshit, but that was the rule. one of these classes was run by an elderly professor who was known for being intolerable, unrelenting, and literally a relic of the past. he constantly claimed "he" invented token ring, and how it was superior to ethernet in almost every way. every exam had a token ring related question, and the only way to get a perfect score on that question was to preform academic fellatio and proclaim that token ring was superior in that scenario because.... whatever. very 2+2=5 if you get me. now the class itself was a mix of foreign graduate students from india and undergrad students from new york. we were typically assigned group work, and the six of us from ny would work together, turn in our papers, the usual... and the graduate students would do the same. for the final project, the professor decided that the undergraduates could learn better if they worked at the graduate level, so the normal teams were split up, and i was put on a team of all indian graduate students. we were given 6 weeks to invent a product and apply previous course work and knowledge into making the product more technological. an example would be a lawnmower that you could control via a cell phone. we could simply say it was a lawnmower, but we'd have to explain in detail the protocols used over the network, encryption, error control, how it would handle signal degradation, etc. very challenging, and yet a great way to show off what i've learned so far. furthermore, we'd all have to grade each other in evaluation forms, and get the other teammates to sign off on it. so if you wanted to give someone a c, you'd have to explain to them why you graded them that way. i was not a fan of this, as i felt it was the professors job to grade us, not our fellow students. he was outsourcing his duties, but the chair of the department was new and didn't want to mess with a tenured teacher. this was the hand i was dealt. the first meeting my team had was lacking, to say the least. the graduate students contributed nothing. one of them worked on a paper from another class, and the other two were just chatterbugs. any idea i had, they instantly approved of. felt good the first few times, but as time went on, it became apparent i was the only one doing the work. this pattern continued into week two and three, and i finally said i couldn't make it anymore due to scheduling conflicts and we'd collaborate online via email. of course, the grad students thought this was a great idea, and we didn't meet in person again [except in class as dictated by the professor]. by week four, i had done what i felt was my part of the work. i'd written eight pages of content, describing how the product would work, it's practical purposes, how it'd communicate over rfid, etc. the only thing i couldn't get my head wrapped around was the high level stuff like error correction, signal drift, and that sort of thing. math was never my strong point, but the grad students said it would be no problem. i thanked them, told them exactly what needed to be done, and even highlighted the important parts of the paper for them. at most, they'd have to write one page each to supplement my eight. they were getting a pretty sweet deal, and i was going to get to graduate. win win i thought. week five comes around and i'm expecting the email with the completed paper. there wasn't a whole lot of email traffic... none to be exact, for the past week. in send out an email asking for a status update since the paper is due next week, and we'll all fail if we miss the deadline. the final paper represents 40% of the final grade. i get an email 2 days before deadline that we all need to meet in the library to finish the paper, and they've been really busy with other coursework. at this point i'm more nervous than angry, as my ass is on the line, and can't afford to fail a class and miss graduation. we decide on a time, reserve a room, and meet. they had literally **nothing** to show for the past five weeks. i know people on reddit exaggerate the word "literally" a lot, but i can't over-emphasize this enough. **nothing**. i explained the situation we were *all* in, and how we'd all fail if we blew this, but they were cocky and sure that he'd never fail them, and they've had him before, etc etc etc. excuses. they wanted me to bet my degree on excuses and false-hope that was backed by nothing. after the meeting i went to meet with the professor. at this point i'm more scared than anything else. too scared to be angry (but it was still there) and incredibly nervous that the old man wasn't going to budge. sure enough... he didn't. i explained my case, showed him all the work i did, described every aspect of the project to him verbally to prove i made a full and honest attempt to get this done, but my teammates were holding me back. 80% of the time he didn't even look at me. just kept repeating that this is what the real work world is like, and this sort of thing will happen in real life and i need to "find a way through it" and all other sorts of useless guidance. in effect, i wasted at least an hour of my life in his office. the dept chair had an office in the same hallway, a few doors down. having no other options, i just sat down in the hallway against the door waiting for him. people would pass by and look at me, some would smile, most didn't. a college student sitting against an office door in a hallway reeks of desperation and hopelessness... which sums up the entire college very nicely in retrospect. after what feels like forever, the department chair arrives, lets me in, and says i have 20min before he has an appointment downstairs, so "make it brief". i gathered my thoughts and made the same case i made to the professor, how i was being sabotaged by my teammates, and the professor refused to hear me out. at one point i challenged the chair about why i'm not going to be graded on my merits and knowledge, but rather who i was associated with involuntarily to begin with. finally he had to dismiss me from his office to get to his meeting, but told me he'd "look into this" and shook my hand. no commitments, no promises, just a handshake. ---deadline--- the different teams present their products, and the professor does his 'interrogations' in a way that makes the trolls of reddit seem like enlightened scholars. he used his +30 years of experience to effectively shoot down everyone on every team in any area they felt they adequately covered. hypothetical situations and impossibilities of costs and scale that turned what was at first a fun project of theory-crafting [with field specific knowledge] into what can only be described as technical draft reading in front of a 1-man firing squad. then the dreaded moment arrives when my team has to present. we get to the front of the class, and know what's coming our way. my seated classmates all had the look of exhaustion and defeat on their faces, and i knew i'd soon be one of them. at this school you got used to being beaten. to give you all the scene: i'm a 5'9" skinny white kid, next to four 6' tall indians who each had at least 30-50lbs on me... so i'm the runt of the litter up there. i pull out my 8 pages and start reading. don't even get off the first page before the professor starts poking holes in individual statements. i politely asked him to hold all questions until the end, so i wouldn't lose my place on the paper (and because i hoped he'd forget most of them by the end)... which he agreed to and smiled. then he walked up to his desk, got a pad of paper and a pen, sat back down, and told me to continue. i smiled at him, because it's all i could do in that moment of defeat. instead of taking small beatings along the way, i was gonna get fucking destroyed by a barrage at the end. jumping out the window looked like a good option at this point [second floor, so i'd live, and probably be able to hobble off with a sprain]. by the time i got to the end of page eight, he was on page three. my classmates had looks of fear and shock when they saw him turning over page after page to jot down notes and questions. for an old bastard, he was meticulous, i'll give him that. so i get to the end, and i ask him if he had any questions he'd like to ask **the group**. at this point, i was the only one who had said a word, so it was high fucking time my other teammates chimed in to help. his questions were just as sharp and pointed as the ones he asked other teams. very advanced, and frankly beyond my level. after he'd read a question, i'd call out one of the others and say "that's an intriguing point you made sir, i'll let $teammate explain that part of the product and hope it'll answer your question". i handed my pages to the teammate and let fate take it's course. now we've all come across people who *think* they're great at bullshitting, but really aren't. you let them dig a hole for a while, then fill it in with them at the bottom. the professor did exactly that. he set them up, gave them a length, then yanked the leash back and called them out on their misunderstanding of the topic, or the product, or the part of the course that explained it. each question i directed to another teammate, one after another. number three tried to "pass" but that just angered the professor, which made him even worse. he started calling out those four graduate students, asking them to describe certain parts of the product.... which is what he was writing down on his pad of paper the entire time, not just questions. number four tried defensive answers and stalling tactics, which again, just angered the professor. at the end, he threw us out of the class. i'll never forget that... he went on a 5min tirade of how we treated our final project like a joke, it was the worst presentation he'd ever seen in his history at the school, and how we should all be ashamed of ourselves if this was our best effort. i was already sweating bullets from fear and anxiety, and after that speech i was glad to be the first one out the door. skipped my other classes, went back to the dorm, locked myself in my room and went to bed at 3pm. didn't know what else to do, and i was mentally exhausted... that kind of exhausted where your brain just goes into shutdown because you can't figure a way out of a mess that you shouldn't have been in in the first place. didn't leave the dorm the next day, nor eat for the 24hrs, didn't even want to drink as i knew that'd make the depression worse. i'd have plenty of time for drinking after telling my parents i wasn't graduating. two days after the presentation, i got an email from the professor, asking for a meeting in room 123 (where room 123 was the chair's office). i accepted and arrived 5min early, with both the professor and the chair already inside. we started early and got right to the point, with the professor looking right at me and asking "what happened here?" as he pointed to my eight-page report on the desk. i explained it as best i could, the product, the function, the technology used... and then he stopped me. he didn't care about that, he wanted to know why i was the only one on the team who had an idea of what the presentation was about. the chair asked if i had bothered working with my teammates at all, since they [apparently] seemed clueless about what i was presenting about. naturally i denied the claim, opening my sent emails folder on my laptop to show all the times i reached out to them, and how infrequently they replied. i told him about the in-person meetings in the beginning, and how i only found out two days before the deadline that they weren't doing anything to contribute. i gently reminded them both that i was in their offices as soon as i found out where this was all heading, but i admitted that i should have kept a better track of their progress. [i learned a long time ago that a little humility and admitting your own faults, no matter how small, goes a long way]. the chair let out a huff of air through his nose and gave a look to my professor. i couldn't tell if it was contempt or not, but it made me feel *slightly* more at ease. the last question i got asked was if the packet of papers was all my original work. "did you write this, all of this, solo?" to which i replied that i had, except the one paragraph that i did a direct quote, but cited properly at the bottom of the page. grades got posted the next week for all my classes. i did decent, but knew i was fucked because the 493 class. the grade posted though was a b-. i refreshed the page several times to make sure it wasn't a formatting problem with the site (a common problem back then), but the grade held. i stopped by the professors office later that day after one of other classes and asked why i got that grade. i explained that i had legitimately thought i had failed based on the final project. apparently the chair suggested that my team **not** be graded according to the previously mentioned system, and be given grades directly from the professor, as is normal in every other class. my part of the work, while lacking in several areas, was acceptable for an undergraduate student. he admitted in plain english that he treats undergrads with more aggression because "the world is not a nice place, and it's better you learn that lesson here where you can get back up after a fall". i told him i appreciated the hard lesson, but there might be better ways of going about it. he didn't care, and i wasn't surprised he didn't either. turns out that i was not the only one they met with in the office. the graduate students were called in one at a time, and were required to bring their parts of the project to the meeting. they all plagiarized. they were either too stupid or too lazy to even try and hide it. the chair ran their papers though one of those plagiarism detection programs and they all came back with +90% certainty. one of them (i'll never know who) copied straight from wikipedia, verbatim. graduate students. he repeated his claim that it was one of the worst presentations he'd ever seen, and how it was shameful... but this time around i knew he was referring to the graduate students and not me. at the end of the meeting i shook his hand, not as a courtesy, but out of respect. his teaching style was unorthodox, but damned if it wasn't effective. i'll never forget the lessons learned from that class, and i don't mean the coursework. as for the graduate students? failed, each of them (and 2 more that weren't in my group). it was a mini-scandal sort of thing on campus; everyone in the major heard about it, and it was the talk of the dining hall for a couple of days. because of the grades, and the plagiarism hit on their record, they all lost their student visas. while i can't be 100% sure they were deported, the plagiarism charge means they can't come back to the school, and no other schools will touch them for at least a couple semesters. they can't get a job in the country without a valid visa either, so it effectively ended them. my degree hangs above my desk at home, and reminds me of those hard lessons learned. **-- tl;dr --** this is a story about a grouchy senior citizen, 3 indians, myself, a chair, and a whole lot of fear. also - one of the hardest lessons i've ever learned. no, not in that way ;)*copied from wikipedia* [charlie wilson] entered politics as a teenager by running a campaign against his next-door neighbor, city council incumbent charles hazard. when thirteen years old, wilson's fourteen-year-old dog entered hazard's yard. hazard retaliated by mixing crushed glass into the dog's food, causing fatal internal bleeding. following this incident, wilson obtained a driver's permit and drove ninety-six voters, primarily black citizens from poor neighborhoods, to the polls in his family's two-door chevrolet. as patrons left the car, wilson told each of them that he didn't want to influence their vote, but that the incumbent hazard had purposely killed his dog. after hazard was defeated by a margin of 16 votes, wilson went to his house to tell him he shouldn't poison any more dogs. wilson cited this as "the day [he] fell in love with america.this little incident happened over the course of the past few months. a little background: my husband and i moved to a new place and didn't know anyone there. he's really outgoing and his new job was filled with people around his age, so he made friends easily. on the other hand, i'm pretty quiet and all my coworkers are at least 20 years older than me and i'm not into "going out" thing, unlike a lot of people my age (mid-20s). so i ended up joining a friend-finding website to meet people that way. also, i've always had more guy friends than girl friends because i connect with them better (growing up with 3 brothers and no sisters will do that to you). so anyway, i start talking to this guy named john on the website and he seems really cool. as i always do when first chatting with soemone on the site, i told him off the bat that i have a husband (in addition to it being in the main area of my profile). he said that he totally understood and i believed him. we eventually exchanged numbers and began to text and make plans to meet up for the first time. before that happened though, he started to change. he began to try and flirt with me, insinuate that he thought i was attractive, etc. i reminded him that i was being 100% serious about not looking for anything romantic. for a few days, he went back to normal. the night before we were set to meet, he sent me a dick pic (which was a really unforunately looking dick) and said "please reconsider. your husband doesn't need to know." at that point, i wrote back saying "i'm not interested and i don't want to meet with you." within 30 seconds, i get a text back saying "what is wrong with you??", followed by a blank text that just says "stagefright detected." thankfully, not only is my phone patched, but the texting app i use won't let the video play. i replied and told him to leave me alone, not mentioning the stagefright message at all. a few days passed and i heard nothing from him. then out of the blue i get a text from john that says, "please give me another chance? it was hard for me to believe you wouldn't even consider me." i told him that it was hard for me to believe that someone would be so malicious as to try and stagefright my phone all over a rejection. he said, "sorry. my pride made me angry." at that point, i knew i could enact my revenge. although i only knew his first name, i was easily able to find him on facebook through his phone number, giving me his last name. from there, i was able to find everything else...twitter, instagram, etc. i took screenshots of everything, including his incriminating admission of attempting to attack my phone. here's where the revenge comes in: he had previously told me that he had gotten into the school of his dreams to study a certain subject not taught at many other places...i figured that this college would be interested to hear that one of their soon-to-be students was engaging in malicious and potentially illegal activity in their free time, so i rang them up. i left messages for multiple offices (any i could think of that would relate to him). the following week, i got a call back from the office of the dean of his program. they asked that i forward everything i had to them, which i did. then i didn't hear anything for a few weeks and figured that was the end of it...until i got a call from the dean herself. she told me that the school took my story very seriously and had decided to withdraw their acceptance of john. she said that she was happy that i came forward with what he had done because they didn't want someone whose behaviour would reflect poorly on their program. i thanked her for getting back to me. i immediately checked his twitter account. yep, sure enough, he had made a series of depressed tweets about how his dream had been stolen from him, he didn't know what to do now, etc. i know that there are way harsher revenge stories out there, but i'm pretty proud of what i did to that asshole.was told to post here from /r/talesfromcallcentres hey all! i used to work for a cable company in eastern canada [rhymes with lifelink] i finished up with them on good terms about 2 years ago and called in due to some issues with my hardwired speed being 20mbps instead of the 50mbps i was paying for, i knew they could guarantee 80% hardwired as was the policy, this woman i got on the phone argues with me up and down [keep in mind i was a supervisor before i left] that they only guaranteed wireless speeds! i told her she was an outright liar and needed to be retrained, went over company policy and what she was supposed to be doing step by step, eventually she put me on hold for 10 minutes after i requested a supervisor cause i was done dealing with her, she comes back and says "are you ready to speak to me like an adult now envory?" i was pretty ticked, went on facebook and contacted the 3 managers i knew from her callcenter and got them to listen in on the call and advised her of what i had just done, she started apologizing profusely and was almost in tears, found out later she got fired as she had been talked to numerous times about this and would not stop. for all you call centre reps out there that do your job, you're awesome, for those of you that are meh at it but still do it, keep it up, for those of you that blatantly lie to customers to get them off the phone quicker and make them call back to pester another rep, a sincere and heartfelt fuck you. remember some of us used to work for you and know higher ups in your company and will report you. have a nice day :)this happened a year or so ago when my friend was driving another friend and i around town on a typical day or whatever. we had just gotten a fuck ton of fast food from the drive-thru (because we're stoners) and we were stopped in the left turn lane of an intersection when some dickhead in a blacked out navigator or aviator suv nailed the side of my friend's car with an egg while making a right turn at that intersection. i didn't think much of it, because i was sitting on the left side and i wasn't paying much attention to detail, but my friend wasn't having it. he instantly peels out of the left turn lane and to the right where the suv had taken off. the driver of the suv obviously made a huge mistake thinking he could get away with this, because he pulls up to the next intersection's left turn lane giving my friend the golden opportunity to equal punishment in an equal manner. as my friend is making his move and he wields his fresh milk shake with his right hand, he suddenly notices the passenger window open. the driver glances over to the right and even before his eyes had a chance to widen, smack. the milkshake travels from window to window, and broke square on the bridge of his nose and all over his blacked out interior all in the same time as my friend took off to the right at that intersection in the same cocky manner as the asshole did at the last. looking back through the rear window, i think he had to remain stopped to process the defeat he had just been dealt. **tl;dr** friends car gets egged by random driver, friend gets immediate revenge throwing milkshake at driver's face and all over his blacked out leather interior. edit: some shit bothered me about my writing so i fixed it, and thanks for the feedback!this is currently happening with a co-worker of mine and i think it fits here. **background** my co-worker, r, is going through a messy divorce with about a week to go before the custody hearing starts for their two daughters. both parents want full custody, and seems willing to fight for it. a couple of weeks ago, r was driving home when two guys with a firearm pulls him over and attacks him. r has recently had a stroke so he installed an emergency button, which he pressed before he got out of the car. 5 minutes later two response vehicles arrives and chases the guys that roughed him up. after "talking" to them for a while the truth comes out. his ex-wive's lawyer hired these thugs to scare him off. about two weeks later, r is sitting at home one evening when his ex-wive and her new fella come knocking on his door. he opens up and they drunkenly start harassing and a verbally attacking him. she tells him that she and her new guy works together and has been fucking long before the divorce has been finalized. r is understandably upset, but he is a gentle guy so he just waits it out and eventually they leave. r is an ex flying squad member and still has a lot of contacts in the police. **revenge** r decided to report them to their company's hr. he needs any dirt on his ex-wive for the custody battle so he tries to dig a bit. the hr lady tells him that the guy is married with kids, and that this is not the first time something like this has happened. r gets the guy's wife's number and calls her calmly, telling her about the affair and emailed her any incriminating stuff he had as proof. the new guy rocks up at r's house that night, drunk and aggressive. r has to point his gun at the new guy to get him to leave. fearing for his own and his daughters' safety, r files a restraining order against the new guy. then he takes down the guy's number plates and calls one of his old flying squad buddies to run it through the system. i turns out the new guy is running fake plates, and now there's a warrant out for his arrest. new guy and the ex-wife both got fired, because their affair is against company policy. **tl&amp;dr - guy's ex wife and new boyfriend is harassing him. he decides to let their work and the guy's wife know. they both get fired. the guy also has false number plates on his car which will lead to his arrest.** **background information:** my family is a family of three, middle class, and we grew up in a nice area. nothing too fancy, nothing terrible. just your typical suburbia with neighborhood parks, churches, &amp; schools all within walking distance. we were nice to our neighbors and all knew each other. my parents had a outdoor fire pit that they like to sit outside on the back patio and drink, listen to music, grill, and relax outside. my family is very respectful of rules so the music was almost never loud, we don't throw parties, and we kept mainly to ourselves but invited people over occasionally. when i was in eighth grade we had some new next door neighbors move in. they were a family of four; mom, dad, son, daughter. the son was a year older than me and the daughter was a year younger than me. the daughter and i hit it off immediately as friends but i noticed something was off when i would go over. for the purpose of secrecy i will change their names; let's call them the smith's. the smith's had a weird idea of how to interact with people. i get it, everyone is different. they were very blunt and open about everything, never would say thank you, didn't think about others. they just turned out to be scum of the earth when it came to treating other people with dignity and respect. just weird people, but i guess it takes all kinds. **the dogs:** my family had a medium sized basenji that my dad had trained very well. when i was a junior in high school daughter smith really wanted to have a new dog. daughter smith basically got whatever she wanted, being the younger sibling and could do no wrong. so mother smith got her a beautiful german shepard. i'll call the dog asshole. now asshole really isn't the one to blame. the smith's never corrected the dog so it's honestly no surprise that asshole never behaved. the dog grew up doing whatever he wanted. he was constantly off the leash in the front yard, tried to pick fights with my dog, in the back yard he was always trying to dig under the fence or in some places tried to knock the fence down. asshole was obsessed with running the fence line with my basenji and just trying to get to him whenever we saw him. they got into a few dog fights when asshole got loose but i promise it was never my dog's fault that this 80 pound sack of fur ran into our yard and picked a fight. **the pre-story:** a few years of this behavior go by and the smith's and my family aren't friendly anymore. we would express to them that their dog was trying to get to our dog, that the fence was in bad shape, that my dad and i were constantly filling the holes under the fence that their dog had dug. they just didn't care. my family went into their own pockets to replace 3 sections of fence and just doing that pissed them off. by the time we are absolutely fed up with it, i had gone off to university and was a sophomore. **the story:** a few days before thanksgiving asshole dug yet another hole under the fence. since i wasn't at home playing with the dog as much and my parents were fixated on getting thanksgiving plans ready, no one noticed the hole. the friday after thanksgiving my parents were out relaxing in the back yard, the dogs were running the fence line and i was about to leave to go hangout with some old high school friends. i went outside to tell my parents that i was leaving when we hear the most horrid yelp by any animal that i have ever heard. asshole had dug far enough to put his head under the fence and bit the shit out of my dog. half of his paw was torn almost completely off as well as some other things that i won't describe. long story short, we had to put my dog down because of it. now, the smith's refused to acknowledge what had happened. they never once said sorry, never once offered to pay any part of the medical bills, nothing. as far as they were concerned, we were the dead ones, not my dog. **the revenge:** by this point my family is pissed, and we have nothing but time on our hands. we devise our revenge over the course of a few months. it had to be gradual and cost them time, effort, money, and most importantly: make them feel like shit. first step: collect dog shit. i'll come back to that later. second step: take them to court and get their dog classified as a "dangerous dog." if you ever have the chance to look at the hoops you have to go through to keep a dangerous dog, you would know it's horrible. the requirements change depending on where you live but in our area, the dog had to be muzzled while outside, never could be off a leash, pay fines, has to have a special crate in their back yard (which was hard for them because they had a pool, random surprise inspections, and if the dog has another incident the dog has to be put down. to be clear, the goal wasn't to hurt the dog. just make their life difficult for as long as the animal was alive. what was important for us us that it set up a record with the city and police department. we slowly convinced our neighbors to call them in on every violation that they did for months. park more than 18 inches off the curb? ticket. loud music past quiet hours? ticket. now, i know you're thinking that calling the cops and making them pay tickets isn't revenge and you're right...it was our cover. we started to play our music loud right up till quiet hours ever single night for three months. when they got fed up with it and tried to call the cops, there was nothing they could do. we'd politely explain that they have had a record of doing the same thing and then they would get reprimanded instead. third step: summer rolls around and now i'm home and working a 9-5 job so all of my nights are free. the smith's son was working second shift at some restaurant so he never got home until after midnight. during the summer in texas, your car could reach 120f to the touch in midday. point being, even at midnight the car was hot. the best part was that all of the smith's cars were parked outside. my mom got this idea after one of her friends got pranked by putting glitter in the air vents that defog your windows. we decided to step it up a notch. if you take frozen shrimp or fish, let it thaw for a day, get it nice and smelly, put it in a blender with a crap ton of water, then freeze it into ice cubes, you can imagine what that smells like when it thaws. one smelly freezer vs what we did...worth it. over the course of june when anyone would check the mailbox (which was perfectly placed on the other side of the smith's house) we would drop one of those nasty ice cubes into the defogger vent of the son's car. then halfway through june we started moving on to the mom's car. like clockwork we would see them on weekends trying to air out their cars all day making it even easier to throw in ice cubes all summer. remember that dog shit i told you about? here's the fourth part. the daughter was a big swimmer all the time. her parents never made her have a job so all she would do is swim all day and night if she wasn't hanging out with friends. my dad came up with the idea of "shit bombs" when he bought a slingshot to shoot down hornets nests. after doing some yard work while still having gloves, he would load up that slingshot with dog shit, shoot it over the fence and into their pool. at first it was only a couple of pieces, then it grew to a few more (by that point we had gotten another dog), and right before their big party we unloaded the rest of the shit we had. the daughter and her friends were swimming for about 2 hours before they noticed the shit floating in the pool. the fifth step took a lot longer to accomplish: their air conditioner was right on the other side of our fence. you could get on your tip toes and see the unit less than five feet away. remember those nasty ice cubes? we started throwing them on top of their unit and they would melt and eventually made the house smell. then, instead of fish in the cubes we slowly replaced them with gravel and sand. the sand and gravel would rattle around at night causing them to no be able to sleep between the smell and the sound. finally, they called out an ac repair man who tried to fix it. the ac guy basically told them he had no idea how sand and gravel was in the unit but that it would eventually need to be replaced. the smith's got suspicious and eventually put up cameras around their house. so we had to back off some. final part: we wanted to move to a different city by the time i was almost graduated from college so we were model citizens and just didn't talk to them. when our house did sell and we were moving out, i waited to check the mailbox until they were out in their front yard. i checked the mail and began my walk back home when they said something along the lines of "glad to see you move" or "good riddance." i stopped to turn at them, made a show of smelling the air and said, "do you smell fish?" then smiled before walking back home. their faces as they figured it out was priceless. don't kill my dog. i'll fuck your shit up. edit: okay i get it. y'all say the house wouldn't smell. obviously the plan still worked cause thie ac was messed up. this is by far the meanest thing i have said to anyone in public and it cost me a lot of female friends. during college i worked at a restaurant with a fairly large staff. (between 60-80 servers and 20 hostess on any given season) i was friends with pretty much everyone and there was always a group of us hanging out after each shift (late night house parties etc). because of that staff dating was common. i never really dove into the staff dating pool but there was one particular girl i was fond of at the time. we got along flawlessly and we were hanging out all the time during work and afterwards at parties. rumor spread that we were secretly dating. i tried asking her out a few times but she always turned me down. never giving a reason. i wasn't salty about it. just figured i wasn't her type or she wasn't attracted to me. no big deal, she was still cool to hang out with. about a year goes by and finally a few of my female coworkers discovers the reason why this girl kept turning me down. the big mystery......i was too short. nothing else that was the only thing holding her back. the news spread quickly. not going to lie, it made me bitter but i held my tongue for almost another year. over that period she had gone off to school. we still kept in touch and i stayed friendly with her because she was still picking up shifts when she was back in town during the holidays or spring/summer breaks. anyways college life must have hit her hard. she packed on the freshman 15 and a little more. i wouldn't say she got fat, maybe chubby. she went from say 110 pounds to 135. this is when i started noticing her attitude towards dating me had changed. her friends were dropping hints like crazy that i should ask her out again. despite the fact of her shallow reasoning beforehand. this is where i hit my tipping point and was pissed off to my core. it all came to a boiling point one fateful night after work. we were both liquored up and she kept pushing me for an answer on why i hadn’t asked her out yet. so i gave it... out loud... in front of all the coworkers at the party. (40+ people) "i tried asking you out for a year and you turned me down every time. neevvverr giving me a reason why." "now i'm date-able?! "the only reason you wouldn't go out with me before was because i was too short. "nothing has changed minus you packing on a few lbs and your self-esteem has dropped. "you were shallow, so here's my reason! "because i don't date fat chicks!" 75% of the female staff stopped speaking to me after that as i was crowned the biggest asshole in the world. however 100% of the guys agreed it was a double standard and justice was served. to be honest, it was her shallow attitude that hit me the most and i wanted her to know what that felt like. it's been over 10 years now and looking back i sometimes ask myself if i should have said it and my answers hasn't changed yet. (yes.... yes i would) edit : fawned to fond (i'll laughing at myself. it is funny) add on: wow do some girls really not see this as a double standard getting a lot of hate email! add on: she openly told a group of about 20 female co-workers. not sure what she thought was going to happen. word spread and yes i was publicly humiliated as it because a common joke at work. i bit my tongue and take all of it for a year. my issue was her changing her mind like i'm some 2nd place prize. her friends assumed i wasn't interest anymore because of her weight gain and throw it in my face all the time that she was still the same person. i never said a word about her weight before that night. label me asshole, then an asshole i will be. so a friend of the mentioned sister has a set of twins. no clue where they picked up this habit, but about every two minutes of their waking lives, they love to scream in the way only 4 year old children can. the kind of scream that is so high pitched your ears will ring after only a few seconds of it. but these two little girls don't just scream for a few seconds, they hold this sound for what seems like eternity until their mom screams back at them to stop. so this sounds really annoying, and it is, but these girls have actually turned out to be pretty good for me since i don't see them but like 1-2 times a year max, and here's how. just a few months ago, my sister asked if i wanted to go to the zoo with her and my nephew, the friend with the two mini-banshees, and our other sister who is cf like me. i say sure, i love seeing the aminals and taking pictures of the pretty birds, so why not. we go, and the twins throughout are pretty good, no screaming and we're already about half way through the day. we're taking our lunch break at this big multi-restaurant plaza on one side of the zoo, and the two girls start their screaming thing when they finish eating. my sisters kid, my nephew, is pretty laid back and usually pretty quiet. he's just like his mom, except that my sister is also one of those people that once they get a stick up their ass, will push their point in a conversation until you just give up because she just doesn't make sense anymore. being that i am cf, and have proclaimed as much for many years, she likes to say 'someday you'll change your mind' all of the time. so on this fateful day, as i'm eating a piece of pizza and have just heard the first set of screams from the twins, she starts with how that sound doesn't bother her as much as it bothers me because i'm 'not a mommy yet'. as soon as she says this, i look down at my nephew, who is just at the age of understanding and being able to kinda-answer questions. i say, "do you hear the sound their making?" he looks at them for a second, looks back at me and nods, and i give him my most encouraging smile. "mommy loves that sound! you should make it for her all the time!" cue the moment i stood and walked to another table with my other cf sister who is just laughing her ass of as our nephew joins the chorus of screams and ignores his mom who's saying 'stop' over and over again in the parent patented 'my snowflake does no wrong' voice, and she is being promptly ignored by him as usual. the rest of the zoo visit continues with me and cf sister splitting from childed sister and childed friend, so that we can actually look at animals instead of walking past as the kids can't stop or they'll disengage from their strollers and run amok. we enjoy ourselves even more as we get a chorus of vocal reminders of where they are in other parts of the zoo the entire afternoon. we leave that afternoon before our sister and her friend are done, since we drove separately, and i don't think much of it. fast forward to today, 3ish months after the zoo trip. we live in different cities, which are only 20 minutes apart, and because of work and stuff we don't meet up very often. my sister calls me, and in the background i hear the screaming. it's been over 3 months and he still does it, even when the twins aren't around. after hanging up from our brief chat about an upcoming wedding we're both attending, i suddenly realize that i have gotten the most longstanding revenge i could possible get without actually being there and doing anything to her myself. i shall now bask in the glow of what i've done. update: we went to our other sisters kid, so our nephews, birthday party recently. he turned 1. her screaming monster finally quit the screaming sometime recently, but i know that dad must have been the one to do something based on what happened there. brother in law, d, is playing with all the kids and trying to keep them entertained, when i notice the screamer being really mean to d. hitting him with sticks and saying mean things because he talks more now. we're sitting at a nearby table with some other adults watching all of this. me: shouldn't you stop him from acting like that? her: well i didn't rile him up, d did, so d get's to settle him back down. cf sister: i thought you were his parent? me: no, because that means she'd actually take responsibility and whip his ass for something once in a while. her: *glares then walks away after a minute to go talk to someone else while ignoring her child* back in the mid 90s i acquired a job at a local parts store. there was the mgr (l), the assistant mgr (r), and me (i) along with three more employees. i quickly ascended the ranks and within a month i was swing mgr. this made r uneasy. r began to find fault with everything i did, and tried everything in his power to make me look bad in front of l. this went on for months. any time i closed and r opened there was always an issue. the door wasn't locked, the alarm wasn't set, the store was a mess...however none of this happened whenever i closed and l opened or if l &amp; r opened together. l mentioned to me to watch my back around r, b/c the dm would be making his rounds soon, and r's input might hurt my chances for another promotion. i formulated a plan. i waited until a day in which l &amp; i opened together, and r came in later to close. around 11:30, i mentioned to l that i was hungry, and would he like a sandwich from busway before he left. i mentioned that i had been doing more computer work lately and had some extra money so it was no big deal he could buy my lunch sometime later. he said ok, i went &amp; got the lunch, we ate &amp; he left. around 2pm r came in, and my first order of business was asking him if i could borrow $10 for lunch b/c i was starving &amp; hadn't eaten. he was all "awwww...man, noooo....i sure don't". before i left that evening i took $50 from the register. i was off the next day. i went &amp; bought beer &amp; cigarettes. the following day when i returned l met me at the door. he said 'i', i had to fire your buddy. i said "what???, why?". he said "the register came up short &amp; when it did the first thing out of his mouth was 'it was 'i', he was asking me for money to get lunch with'. l said "i looked him in the eye and said 'i know you're a damn liar, he ate lunch with me and even bought mine, you've been trying to sabotage him from day one and i'm sick of it. you're fired, get your stuff and get out' over the course of the next few months, i slowly paid the money i'd taken back into the register. in less than a year i'd decided that i wanted to do computers full time, so i quit. a few years later i met r in a store somewhere in town, his only words to me were 'you're a sonofabitch' i dated a girl for about four years, lets call her brandy. we were best friends before we dated, then we dated for about four years. she was awesome. i loved her very dearly. as far as i knew we were awesome together and great as friends and as lovers. we rarely ever fought. we got along great. we got engaged and had plans to get married. as far as i knew everything was perfect. in fact, i still doubt i will ever find another partner that i am that compatible with. i spoiled her too. maybe that was my biggest fault. i always let her go shopping whenever wherever she wanted, i kept her fed from a golden spoon and wrapped in the finest linens. even if she didn't ask, i typically enjoyed spoiling her. that's just how i am. she had recently gotten a part time job as a funeral directors assistant, paying $10 an hour, and i had subsequently gotten her a new cellphone line for her as a work line, as a celebratory gesture, because she had been wanting a note 5 and wasn't due for an upgrade. she said she would pay for the balance on the old phone with her first check. then one autumn day our only car got repoed. she called the bank, the bank said i was three months behind on my payments. i knew that wasnt right. that's when she told me it wasn't working out. she said she was tired of being broke and struggling financially. she wanted something better out of life than being broke all the time. the interesting thing to note here, is that she hadnt worked in a couple years, and had been living off of my paycheck. i'm a network engineer, live confortably in a fairly nice house with lots of the latest toys and gadgets and everything but my newest car is paid for. i would hardly call that struggling. but it apparently wasn't good enough for her. so she left after the car got repoed. i was upset about it and went to my mothers house for the day while she packed her shit. while i was at my moms i paid the repo fees and the past due balance for the amount the bank told me that was owed. turns out the balance was for a different account, the bank had repoed the wrong vehicle and given me the wrong account number to pay. so i paid somebody else account. they fixed it, applied the balance to my (not past due) account and promptly gave me my car back i came back that evening with some friends and she had taken everything. she took all of the furniture, except a couch and my bed and my kids beds. she took collectibles, decorations, food, basically everything that wasn't nailed down. also when she left, she took her two cellphones that i have been paying for on a payment plan. so i still had to deal with my cell phone bill being $300/mo for three phones, when i only use one of them. i still owe $1200 for those two phones then there was a matter of a $2,000 loan she had taken out with my mom, that she had agreed, in writing, to pay back. i sent her an email a few days later asking for my stuff back and for the money she owed and she responded that i was harrassing her and that if i ever contacted her again she would call the cops and threatened bodily harm from her stepdad. so i suspended her lines and didn't say anything. she called me from a borrowed phone the next day to ask me if i was going to tell her before i turned her phone off. i said i didn't feel like i need to, since they were my phones and the account was in my name. since then she has tried to have my electricity turned off. which didn't happen, because they called me to confirm. she has tried to sell my car without having it in her possession, which failed. she has tried to call the police on me for harassment, dumped trash in my yard and called the homeowners association, and broken into my house and left things and taken other things, on several different occasions. i have changed my locks and set up security cameras since then. so enough of the backstory. here's where my revenge comes in. i took her to small claims court for $9,500 for property and damages and all the money she owed and i won. granted i have to pay to have that enforced, and honestly i don't even care to enforce it. but i won. revenge is mine i also got a promotion at my job since she left, was recently given a a raise and a big fat bonus, just got a $1,000 voucher from delta since they screwed up my flight, and things are generally better than they had been before she left, tenfold. she lives with her mom in a tiny room with no air conditioner, and no heater, can't get a car (my buddy owns a car lot, she tried to buy from him because everybody else had turned her down. he turned her down on principal) or a cell phone because of her credit, and relies on friends and family to drive her to her 2 day a week job and school. she also owes $40,000 for school loans for her first couple years, and shes got four more years left to go. but i guess thats better than struggling, right? tl;dr fiance tried to take everything because of an error on the banks part that resulted in our car being repoed, screwed herself over in the process, then i put the final nail in the coffin by suing her and winning. edit #1: a letter edit #2: i just wanted to add this. after i suspended her phone lines, she got really angry and attempted to get revenge in a number of ways, all of which failed. 1. she tried to sell my car to a dealership without having the car with her. (how stupid can you be?) 2. she tried to have my electricity turned off. 3. she hacked my facebook 4. broke into my house several times, (left things, took other things) until i changed the locks and put in security cameras. 5. she tried to close out my loan account with the bank, and have them repo the car. (they told her as long as it was being paid for they wouldn't repo the vehicle under any circumstances) 6. she tried hacking all my email accounts, bank accounts, steam account, xbox account, and any other account she could to try and screw me over. 7. she managed to cancel one of my debit cards, but it wasn't my main one and she didn't take any money, she just wanted me to face the dificulty of not having a debit card? 8. she threatened me multiple times "physical bodily harm" from her stepdad and brother. 9. dumped trash on my lawn and called the homeowners association. 10. frequently sent me pictures of that cat that we adopted. (this one hurts a little bit, but i'll never let her know that) 11. made sure that everybody knows what a horrible person i am and how shitty i was througghout her entire relationship. through all that, the only time i ever contacted her was to ask for my stuff back. once. that's it. i gave her a list of stuff that she took, told her she had a week to give it back, or else. if she ever attempted to contact me i ignored it completely. she flipped the fuck out and started trying to somehow enact revenge. i never once called the police on her, i never let on that any of it bothered me, i never said "hey, why did you do this?", but she kept on continously trying to screw me over, failing every single time. i never flinched or batted an eye. that to me is the unltimate victory. i don't know if this is truly petty revenge but it may fit... a few weeks ago, one of our fellow employees (be for belittled employee) decided he had enough of his manager's constant belittlement and short temper so he gave his 2 weeks notice and let them know he was more than happy to work those two weeks to finish off his job. said anger management issues manager (ami) is also an owner of the company. he absolutely loses it. he starts screaming at the guy, telling him to leave the premises immediately and flips him the bird on the way out the parking lot. this action causes immense problems for us in the short term. be had a transmission for a large machine pulled apart with hundreds of parts strewn across his bench. that was friday. i come in on tuesday morning and i am informed the other owners have decided they need to buy this owner out. (finally! this wasn't the first time he had cost us an employee) i was hired and work directly under the general manager (gm who is also an owner with his brother). while we are talking about this in my office, i politely ask my boss to hang on and i dig through my desk and fire up some of our accounting software. i quietly show some of the evidence of ami's misdealings to gm. it isn't enough to be a smoking gun of fraud (that is why i was waiting before bringing it to him. i also only noticed the issues a few weeks ago and was waiting until i had more evidence). gm smiled slightly, thanked me and left. we went back to business as usual until the buyout. ffw to now, ami is getting bought out. after they have settled on a price for the buyout and signed everything, gm brings the evidence of fraud against ami (which he has now added to by digging a little deeper). ami now has to pay back the fraudulent payments out of his buyout, resulting in him getting approximately ~~20%~~ 25% less than what he thought he was getting. **update:** found out how the gm handled it. ami signed all the papers and signed something to the effect that his department's financials were accurate. just after he signed that paper, gm reveals the paperwork in epic fashion as per his brother's description. ami absolutely loses his shit and starts screaming. his lawyer had to calm him down. business valuation was around 10 million and he had a 30% stake so it cost him $750,000. also, a call has been placed to the revenue agency in our country for suspected tax evasion by gm and yours truly as my boss has evidence of some private fraud now as well. **update #2** bosses are implementing an employee purchase plan for stock ownership (voting shares!) and essentially they are giving me 2% of the company shares as my bonus along with a raise. i'll take it! **tl;dr: angry owner loses his shit on employee, other owners decide to buy him out, i present evidence of fraud to owners and he gets less money at the buyout.** edit: moved tl;dr to bottom.my parents live in a pretty suburban neighborhood and kinda keep to themselves, they are indian and are the nicest people, but are quiet to everybody except a few well known friends in the neighborhood, they also have heavy indian accents. most of the neighborhood are exceptionally nice to us except this one kid who hates my parents for complaining about him speeding down our residential inner roads at dumb speeds and makes fun of them using tasteless mocking of their accents. long story short, this kid got his buddies together and drive-by baseball batted our mailbox, there was no way to prove it was him and i only knew he did it because he would make fun of my dad or myself when we went to our bent mailbox and he happened to be passing by, (windows rolled down yelling out "oh no!" in a fake indian accent and driving away). even worse was we ended up fixing the mailbox once and over a year and half later it was batted down again, i suspect the same kid but again had no way to prove it was him. this last year however, i decided to say "fuck this kid" and built a brolic concrete pole for our mailbox with rebar in it. i painted it too to make it non-obvious it was cement and made sure to put those solar lights on it so that it'd be lit in the night and no one would accidentally run into it. the only reasonable chance of hitting it would be if you were trying. this kid took over a year for his previous revenge so we ended up waiting after building that until last thanksgiving, during the night we heard a loud "clink" outside of what sounded like aluminum bat being stopped dead in its tracks, a short loud yelp and a car speeding off. in the morning, it looked like this: kid hasn't mouthed off yet and his hand was in one of those braces for a while, it felt satisfying. i plan to mime a "hurt hand" every time he drives by again.this is a story that happened over the span of a few years. when i first started med school, i had a girlfriend who was decently attractive. not 10/10 but definitely a solid 7/10. unfortunately, she thought of herself as a 10/10 and acted like one too. as med school wore on, i started spending more time studying and less time caring for myself. as she was a "10/10" and thus had no business doing anything beneath her, i was the only person who was doing the cleaning, cooking, and paying for the apartment we shared. this took up even more of my time as i entered my internship. sometimes i'd come back to a dirty apartment that i'd have to clean up after a long shift, and i only had less time to take care of myself as a result so my appearance suffered; i got fatter and some days i'd have to rush out the door without shaving because i'd only gotten two hours of sleep after cleaning and cooking. she'd never help and she was verbally (and sometimes physically) abusive. i stayed with her because i was deeply in love with her. about half a year into my internship i found out my girlfriend was cheating on me with some art student she said "was there for her" and "made her feel special and needed." i told her to get out of my apartment, and she was all too happy to do so. fast forward a few years and she's in a master's program in europe an starts talking to me again. i'm on the cusp of finishing my residency and about to start earning the "big bucks" people think doctors earn. she asks me for another chance; i was tempted to go for it until she started verbally abusing me again over our facetime/skype sessions. i hatched a plot: i told her she'd have to quit her master's program and come to the states within three months (she was graduating in six). she was reticent to do so, but i told her that if she wanted me back she needed to give me a show of good faith. i guess she figured she'd hamstring me by trapping me with marriage because she agreed. the day before she was due to fly out to the u.s. i told her i was lying. i blocked her on all my accounts and never spoke to her again. from what i understand she's now surfing couches getting by on begging for charity from what few friends she made in europe, and sometimes fucking some dude twice her age so he'd throw money at her. tl;dr: don't cheat on med students. we bust our asses during med school and if anyone mistreats us, we remember that shit for the rest of our lives.a couple of decades ago (mid-80's), i had occasion to need body work done on my car (kid in the lane to my right tried to turn left without looking), and took it into a large and supposedly well-regarded body shop for repairs. in hindsight, i should've known it wouldn't turn out well when they refused to give me a quote without seeing my insurance estimate first... to keep this short, suffice to say that they screwed it up; charged for undercoating that wasn't applied, got cheap non-oem replacement parts, ignored instructions to replace the fender (was okayed by the insurance co.) and slathered a couple of pounds of bondo on it instead (doing a miserable job of matching the contours), and myriad other screw-ups. within a week of getting the car back from them, i'd returned with a long list of problems, quality complaints, and omissions. the general manager (found later he was the owner's nephew and had a rep for being an asshole) basically blew me off with a combination of indifference and rudeness - as to the quality complaints, he said "look, this car isn't worth putting cadillac-level work into it - you want it done better, you'll have to pay us more money." i then did what most pissed-off customers do - bad-mouth the company to anyone who would listen. anytime i saw any car in need of bodywork, i'd warn the owner against this body shop, making my case by showing them the poor work done on my car. i continued doing this for at least 4 years, until i finally sold the car. the real revenge part was that about every 4 to 6 months, i'd call the shop and ask to speak to the gm; when i got him on the phone, i'd identify myself as a po'ed former customer and tell him that i'd saved a dozen or so people from his company's shoddy work, and i'd probably cost his shop about $10,000 or thereabouts. the first two calls he blew off; by the 4th call he was getting worried, and wanted my name and for me to come in so that "we could come to an agreement and get you satisfied" - i told him he had already blown his one chance to make good by insulting me when i came back to get them to do the job right. as to my name, i told him he could easily find it by going over his list of customers who'd come back with complaints about the work they'd done. i continued the calls even after i'd sold the car, for about 6 years or so; towards the end of that time, i'd point out to him that his attitude had potentially cost his company over $100,000 worth of work. on my last call, i actually got the owner (the nephew was on vacation) and spent a good 15 minutes on the phone with him explaining why i'd made it a 6-year mission to cost them as much business as i possibly could, and that his jerk of a gm had blown any chance of ever getting me to quit bad-mouthing them. i later heard from friends at a wrecking yard in the same town that the body shop had a new gm...sorry this is short, but there really isn't a whole lot that went into it. basically, we have a vp who is the caricature of asshole bosses. he verbally abuses his subordinates, he confuses bullying with "leadership", and he doesn't have a god damn clue what he's doing. well, i and a few other project managers had enough of his shit. we met for lunch, and one of my colleagues came up with a great plan... we learned the cso's daughter was looking for a position. so, we put in a recommendation for her, and told her to do everything she could to hide her relation, under the auspices that the vp and her dad didn't get along, and wanted to make sure she could get the job. she got the job. it went way better than we hoped. not only did he give her shit and swear at her on a number of occasions, apparently he called her into his office and told her the only position he was willing to keep her for was "under his desk." we got the organizational announcement on friday*, and it seems the vp is "off to pursue the next great chapter of his life." i hope that chapter involves him shoveling shit somewhere. *i didn't see the announcement until today, when one of the other pms texted "mission accomplished." i get dozens of those things in a week, and i just ignore them, half the time.when i was 9 i had a cat that i loved, she came when i cried, slept in my bed, the works. one day she came home real fucked up. she had a 2in hole in her chest, cracked rips, and her spine was snapped at the base of her tail. we took her to the vet and they told us she had been beaten up by some kids. they had hit her with a golf club and swung her around by her tail, almost killed her. she had to go through surgery but she lived. we called the police who told us they couldn't do anything, because she probably was hit by a car. (even though there were no scratches on her, or dabris from a road.) but that wouldn't stop me from getting my revenge. later that week on the bus, some of the kids from down the street were bragging about the cat they beat up. i asked them for the details, acting all excited about it. once i was sure it was them i hatched my plan. a week or so after that i snuck out of the house, stole a gas can from the garage, and a box of matches. i walked through the woods (i live in the middle of fucking nowhere) to the kids house. now this kid loved his dirt bike, and he kept it in his back yard. so i hopped the fence and poured the gas all over this dirt bike, and set it on fire. then like a god damn badass, i walked back to my house. i never got caught or even questioned. seeing that kid crying on the bus telling his shitty friends how he no longer had a dirt bike to ride was the most satisfying thing of my life.i found my way here via a story over on tales from retail because a user had suggested one story should be cross-posted here. after reading some of the stories here and giggling to myself at my work desk, i recalled a story from my teenage years that should definitely be shared. i spent my high school years in a small town in wisconsin. there were only a few stop lights and everyone knew everyone. if you screwed up or did something embarrassing, everyone knew about it within hours, sometimes sooner. i had a small circle of friends and then a host of "acquaintances" that i hung out with from time to time. one of them is the center of our story. he was a pretty good guy. we'll call him ted, for story's sake. the problem, of course, was that he was your standard outcast in high school life. he wasn't athletic, played video games in a time when gamers truly were considered nerds or geeks, and was a skinny kid with glasses, which made him easy to pick on. i have been and always will be a gamer, so he and i had no issues getting along. i was slightly more athletic and played football, so i was able to at least keep some guys off of his back for him. there was nothing i could do about the hockey guys, though. let's go to the event in question. it was a saturday and we were at the bowling alley with a couple of our mutual friends. all was going well until several members of said hockey team come walking in and, of course, get put in the lane just a couple down from us. close enough where they could be dicks and show off in front of their girlfriends. of course, they singled him out and left the rest of us alone, but that doesn't really fly very well with me and tried to get them to stop, which failed, of course. after putting up with their bullshit for an entire game, ted finally showed a little backbone and, quite loudly, told them to shut the fuck up and leave him alone. well, in small town logic, doing something like that means you are asking for more trouble (or maybe it's just terrible high schooler logic?) that you don't want. one of the players said to him: **oh, you're going to be a big man now? well, don't worry. we'll put you in your place.** i stepped in and told them to just leave us alone and that nothing needed to happen, because it was really pointless, as just about everything was regarding high school issues. they stopped it and we finished our game, heading out to one of our mutual friend's house to hang out there. we think nothing of it and i head home pretty late that night. my phone rings the next morning. it's ted. he's crying. *ted: gnpunk, they egged my house last night...* &gt;the hockey guys? *ted: yes. it's a mess!* &gt;how bad is it? and how do you know it was them? *ted: one of them called me to rub it in. we had the windows open! some of it got in here!* i headed over there shortly and, sure enough, the house was absolutely pelted and covered with yolk, marks, egg shells, etc. inside the house were at least seven or eight direct hits. it was pretty gross. i stuck around and helped him clean it up. during the clean-up, though, i realized that ted was not only over his crying, but he was plotting revenge. when we were done cleaning up, he started calling up a couple of his friends for ideas. he wasn't going to be able to get everyone back, but he could at least get the one that seemingly led the charge. and he did get him. holy shit, did he get him. being in wisconsin, one thing that underagers really like to do, besides drink illegally, is to chew tobacco. he had a couple of friends who did just that and, because they weren't exactly the cleanest people around, had some bottles of spit and other things laying around. he asked them to bring him whatever they could. before they came over with those bottles, he went and bought a couple dozen eggs. i assumed he was going to return the favor of egging the house and just taking it one step further. nope. he was out to do damage. &gt;so, what's the plan? *ted: i'm going to get however big of a container that i need and throw all of this together. rotten eggs, chew spit, whatever else i can find.* **throws up in mouth a little** &gt;that's....wow, that's pretty damn good. you going to throw it on the asshole's house? *ted: oh, no. something way better than that.* he ended up combining all of it into a small bucket. there was a lot of it. it was extremely disgusting. to top it off, he left it outside in the sun to just kind of stew for awhile. it was an unusually warm spring for us, so leaving that outside to stew was pretty damn ingenious. he left it outside for a week. by the time the following weekend rolled around, this was some of the worst smelling shit i had ever encountered. the kid had a plan, and he was going to do whatever he had in mind. his parents were trying to figure out if it was possible to do an investigation, but with no witnesses, there wasn't much they could do. phone calls meant nothing, and ted figured this was the best option. ted's plan was simple: you see, hockey asshole had a brand new truck. it also had a pretty good sound system in it, and these guys would hang out in parking lots and just sit around, talking, bitching, and he would have his windows wide open. ted was getting that bucket of wretchedness into the cab of his truck. he didn't care how. unfortunately, i was not around to witness this. i was out of state with family the weekend that it occurred, but i did get the phone call from our friend who drove him to the hang out. he was lucky enough to catch them in the parking lot and far enough away from the truck where he had a clean shot. they pulled up along side of the truck and ted managed to pop out, launch the contents of the bucket into the cab through the window, and get back into the car before they could make it to him. while on the phone with the getaway driver, i could hear ted laughing so hard in the background, he was hyperventilating. i was concerned that he was going to get into major trouble, but he truly did not give a fuck. he had reached his breaking point and was basking in the glory of his revenge. i got back to school on monday and it was the talk of the school. the truck's interior was flat out ruined and smelled like sex panther. he couldn't even drive it because ted had managed to do a surgical strike and douse just about everything, and then just chucked the bucket into it upside down to ensure it all got in there. he had become a legend in the manner that he had hoped for. ted had been concerned that he was going to get his ass kicked because of this and, truth be told, i think everyone expected it. however, it didn't happen because word had already reached the higher ups in the school. my town was very much a good ol' boy town where "eye for an eye" still meant something. the two of them were brought into a meeting and told that they were not to even speak to each other. as for the damages caused, both sets of parents were informed of what was shared in the meeting where each of them admitted to their actions. the parents were asked to handle discipline of each of their children and to work out the issue of the damages caused. the parents ended up agreeing to just take care of their own problems and leave it at that. no one bothered ted after that. hockey asshole's truck became known as the "spit cup truck" which pissed him off to no end. ted ended up getting a girlfriend out of the whole mess because, honestly, showing that kind of balls, it just had to happen. he never really became a "popular" kid in high school, but no one dared to fuck with him after that. and that, my friends, is a dish of revenge served ice cold. **tl;dr: friend gets his house egged by asshole. revenge comes in the form of a bucket of tobacco spit and rotten eggs in said asshole's truck. hilarity ensues.**after posting this on /r/idontworkherelady/ i was told i should post it here. hope you guys like it. i just discovered this sub and have spent the better part of the day procrastinating and laughing/crying as i can relate. so on to the backstory: the town i lived in wasn't huge and at the time only had one gas station. i got a job there at the ripe old age of 15 and worked there for 2 years. by the end of my time there i was essentially number 3 (with the manager and ass-manager ahead) in charge. eventually another gas station opened up across the road and i got a job there. there was pretty high turnover so by the end of my tenure there everybody else including the managers were new. this story takes place about a year after i left them. one last thing to say, puberty is a bitch and didn't feel like making its way over to me forever so from age 12 to 18 i looked like the same. (not exactly but i looked really young until about 19, a little bit insecure about it) soooo, since i knew all the employees at the store i would always get gas and grab a nice ice cold chocolate milk from there rather than my store. when i got to the fridge with my milk i was dismayed to find that there was no more. but seeing as i spent the entirety of my working time at the same store i knew that they kept the stock in the back of the walk-in fridge behind some boxes. this fridge was also where all the beer was so when a customer, (old bitch), noticed that i knew what i was doing assumed i worked there. that seems fair considering she had probably seen me there on many occasions, and i usually have no problem helping people. oh if i had known that how good a day this would turn out to be. ob: "hey kid! " knowing that there wasn't anybody else in this tight ass fridge i turned around from fumbling about in the boxes. ob: "ya you, go put this case of beer at the cash."*holding out case of beer* even if i did work there i wouldn't have done it but i figured i'd gently remind them i am an actual person. me: "sorry, i don't work here anymore. plus miss, that was really rude." i'm going to have to assumed that i triggered something for her because she lost her shit screaming about how she had seen me here before and she knew i worked here. i tried to get a word in edgewise but was unable to and with her between the door and myself i figured i might as well try and ignore her and find my chocolatey goodness. ob:"look at me when i'm talking to you! you ungrateful child!" me:"look it seems like you're having a bad day so i'm going to let all that slide and just remind you that i no longer work here." with a huff she turned around and walked out but not before she threw out one last insult. ob:"your mother must have been incompetent to have raised such a selfish boy." i had been having a good day up until that point because my usual self is a vindictive little shit who normally would have screamed right back at her. that changed when she insulted my mother. i found my drink and went to the registers. these machines were ancient and took about 15 minutes to boot up and glitches frequently. karma strikes quick and without mercy, for when i got to the cash they were having some technical problem with it and the screen was frozen/glitched/karma. knowing there was nobody in the store except for myself, the bitch and my buddy who just started working there about 3 months prior, i was in no rush to help. when my friend finally got fed up with trying the usual debug procedure he looked up and asked for my help. when working there i was the go-to person and i still frequently got calls from the management asking if i could pop by and fix something for them in exchange for some free candy. win-win. i glanced over at the screen and immediately recognized the problem and knew that it was a simple fix, all he had to do was click two buttons at the same time. if you had thought that ob had gotten an quieter as this whole process was going on you were wrong. she must have seen the recognition in my face when i saw it because she started howling at me to fix it so she could get out of there. seeing my chance for revenge i struck. me:"apologize." ob:*stunned look*"what did you say to me?!?!?!?" me:" i would like you to apologize to me and i'll fix the problem." ob:"you little shit fix it right now or i'll have you fired!" me"i'd like to remind you that i don't work here and i still expect an apology." i assume she was running late because after another 2-3 minutes of back and forth she finally relented. ob:*grumble*"i'm sorry... now will you fix the machine?" and normally i would have accepted it but i still had another 30 minutes to get kill before i started work at the gas station across the road so i figured i'd push it. me:"sorry for what?" more incoherent yelling from this lady and my friend tries to stifle his laughter... me:"i didn't hear an apology in there." ob:"i'm sorry... for being rude... even though you were being a brat." i stared at her, just thinking, she was so close, so so close, she could have been free to enjoy her beer and free to annoy anybody else that crossed her path... but alas it was not meant to be. me:"nah. i don't accept, have a nice day." she had a dumb look on her face before it turned to a scowl and she started screaming again. ob: "i swear i'm never coming back to this gas station ever again! the employees here are *expletive* *expletive*[...] *expletive*..." as she stormed out. now most people would be content with that, i however was not. i quickly hit the buttons fixing the machine and ran out yelling a quick goodbye and telling him i'm pay for this tomorrow. see she swore the one thing i knew she wouldn't be able to keep, she swore she was never coming back to that gas station. which could only mean she had one place to go for her booze. across the road, to the gas station i work at, the place where i'm the number 1 employee and where the owner would back me up if he were there and if he wasn't i was in charge. i ran over to my job and told the cashier to him to take a break, sit back, and enjoy the show. by the time i got there she had already rushed into the fridge to get her beer and when she got out she was greeted by the sight of me grinning from ear to ear behind the register. cut to 15 minutes of swearing later and she leaves again, sans beer. my coworker standing there slack jawed wondering how i was able to stand that verbal tirade and even more confused as to why i kept on laughing even more as she went on. that was a good day. __________________________________________ edit: since the post blew up on /r/idontworkherelady i decided to throw in a bonus unrelated story and figured i might as well share it here. for that lovely compliment i've decided to share a completely unrelated story from my time working at the gas station. i'm sure you got this from the above story but if you didn't i'll tell you about myself, i can keep calm in virtually any situation. that said some people get to me, it could be anybody doing something that just makes something snap. it very rarely happens but this was one of those times... it was a day like every other when in walks a middle aged gentlemen, now normally you would here how this guy looked like a tool, or he came in swearing but not in this story. this man looked like your average joe, maybe he looked a little grumpy but it was early sunday morning (my favourite shift for other reasons) so i could forgive a little frown. so i gave this man my usual cheerful greeting which was answered with a short grunt. still at least he acknowledge i said something, not great but better than being ignore. as he reached into his pocket and threw his lottery ticket and some change at me. now nobody likes having shit thrown at them but i had had it happen before and it would certainly happen again. i assumed he wanted me to check his ticket and replay it but i figured it would be best to ask just in case. now only because i had been working in gas stations for 3 1/2 years was i able to guess thats what he wanted. my question which was certainly valid was met with this response: "obviously, now shut up and do your job." *eye twitch* wtf, i stared are him. it's on, i don't know how i'm going to get back at him and i haven't seen him before which must mean he doesn't live in town. i only have moments left to get back at him, but due to a combination of tiredness and laziness this sunday morning i couldn't think of a clever way to get back at him. my mind was racing: shower him with kindness, no not enough time, throw his money on the ground, could do better, i was running out of time as i got his change and then i went to the default way i dealt with assholes. i felt like i had failed, i could do so much and yet i was left to see him out with a cliche. "hope your day is as pleasant as you are." i yelled out as he was almost out the door. thinking to myself how i had just missed the perfect opportunity. thats when it happened. he turned back, he was walking back in. this was it round 2 was happening. at this point i was 19, for all the insults i hurled at puberty it threw them right back at me and hit me like a freight train, i went from 5'5" 105pounds soaking wet to 6'2" 175lbs of muscle. i was not about to be intimidated by this man. he scowled and then he went full soccer mom, demanding to speak to my manager, threatening to get me fired, etc... this went on for 5 minutes before he left, as i got the final words: "have a great day, and remember to go fuck yourself" it was not the greatest of wins but i believe i finished on the upper hand. i just didn't understand how somebody could get under my skin that easily. i pushed the thought from my mind knowing i wouldn't get in any trouble for what i said. all was forgotten... until about 6 months later, i'm working my usual sunday morning shift 7am-12pm, nursing my hangover from the night before, not sure if i'm still drunk or not when in walks a customer. my head ringing because of the buzzer on the door. the man walks up and throws his shit at me and i ignore it because it hurts to look at the light. finally handing the man his cash i look up and this man. his face... it looks familiar.... no it doesn't mean anything, i see the same people all the time.... i started to feel angry at this man for some reason... i couldn't understand why this random customer was infuriating me so much just looking at me as i had his change in my hand. my mind was telling my body to give him the change so i could get back to my nap but i couldn't bring myself to do it. "hey are you going to do your job or just stand there" my eye refocused, i realized i still had the money in my hand so i put it on the counter instead of his outstretched hand, thats not very nice i thought to myself. as i looked up again he was scowling and it clicked. my eyes flashed recognition at the same time as his did. i saw him open his mouth but i had already started to unleash what would be the round one knock out. "didn't i tell you to fuck off?" already reaching down for the business card with the owner/managers number on it i slammed it down on the counter and went back to my corner to wait for the count to declare me the undisputed champion as he walked out of the store already pulling out his phone. i laid back and waited for the inevitable phone call i was about to receive from the owner. i smiled as i drifted back into my hangover induced nap.a friend of mine was electrocuted at work. it was pretty bad. later on, he was fired because he was electrocuted. fortunately he turned that around when he learned he could get disability for the electrocution, but it knocked out several teeth that aren't coming back. anyway, i called osha and told them about the electrocution. they weren't so interested in that, but perked right up when i told them that the place routinely locked the emergency fire exit doors to prevent employees from stepping outside to sneak a smoke. well, they inspected, found the locked emergency exit doors, and went to town on them. turns out a long time ago a business on the east coast locked the security doors and there was a fire, killing several dozen people. osha gets very very sensitive about stuff like that. the owner was fined $40k for the security doors. he also spent quite a bit of money fighting it for 10 years, but eventually had to pay anyway.on the advice of my attorney, i started recording all calls with my ex during the divorce process. indiana (at least at the time) was a single party consent state. meaning only one person in the conversation had to know it was being recorded. the look on her face when i hit play and the judge got to hear her say "i don't give a fuck what that bitch judge says, you get visitation when i say you get visitation" was absolutely priceless. can you say contempt of court? i got everything i wanted out of the divorce with the judge landing on my side for any contentious items. she even made my ex pay my attorney fees. tl:dr don't ever get caught calling a female judge a bitch edit: the contempt was for refusing to comply with a court order of visitation. not the language she used. but the language she used did seem to prejudice the judge in my favor from that point on. copied and pasted from [this thread](this is not my story; a buddy of mine use to do car a/v in his garage/driveway for some extra cash during high school. one weekend i was helping him finish up a car. there was a local kid notorious for not paying for things/stealing etc... being a douche bag. so on this fair weekend said kid had procured a new radio for his honda accord. he asked my friend to install it, no problem he probably asked him for $50. long story short his policy was cash upfront or no dice. kid came up with every excuse under the son as to why he needed it done, and done fast but would pay for it later. so my buddy agrees, i'm shaking my head at this point but it wasn't my call. we tear into his car, while i'm piecing together the new harness my buddy is under the hood laughing and tracing the horn and wiper wires. knowing the kid wasn't going to pay he wired everything to a relay, so when the radio turns on the horn and wipers also go on [genius]. kid comes to pick up his car end of the day and sure enough doesn't/can't pay, but threatens to call the cops etc etc so my buddy gives him the car back no hassle. my buddy said fine take it, kid pulls out of the drive way and you hear hoooonk, hoooonkl, and i remember us almost pissing ourselves laughing. kid gets pissed and threatens to sue, cops etc... my buddy tells him when he pays he will fix it, kid tells him to go f himself. we never spoke to him after that, but from what we heard his parents took the car to the dealership and payed $$$$$ to get it fixed. tl:dr kid refuses to pay for radio install, gets his horn and wipers attached to his radio power button. don't fuck with people servicing your shit. so your typical trailer trash redneck family move into my grandpa's rental house. the father is a loud and easily enraged 'handyman', his wife almost never seen, and one son is a rapist while the other is a multi-felon bag of nuts. drugs and parties galore, you get the idea. the house, which could fetch $1400 a month(which is generally a large/nice house in our area), is destroyed over five or six years for only $600 a month. when he actually pays it, that is. grandpa during this time is showing all the symptoms of dementia, and would normally never let someone get the better of him like this, so at one point i start working with my father doing up keep in grandpas place. at this point i live in one of grandpas houses within walking distance of the one redneck has been living in, so i of course had the great pleasure of being able to tape the multiple eviction notices to their doors when they hadn't paid rent for 6 months. after all of the legal proceedings, it has been eight months that they haven't paid rent and the sheriff is present as we set their things outside because the judge approved an immediate eviction. it probably helped when they didn't even show up to court to defend themselves. they hadn't been seen for a couple days, so they weren't present for this, therefore we were courteous enough to bring in our own guys to 'carefully' move their things out. the lawman there were happy to take every little bit of paraphernalia that was found in the process. redneck did show up later that night though, so i stood on my porch out of sight and listened as he got out of his car to scream "this is bullshit!" as loud as he could in full redneck accent. we had already changed locks and literally bolted shut the windows, so they left after collecting some random things and as is expected, redneck squeeled his tires on the way out. they broke in the back door that night but didn't do any other damage, and were already gone the next morning. we notified the police and replaced the door as it was weak anyway. for the full picture, the house is a two story, three bedroom with two full baths, two large living rooms, two large fireplaces, french doors onto a large deck and a garage as well as a carport in the back. it also came with all of the appliances, some furniture and whatnot. the surrounding area is fields and woods, with a really nice view out of the bay windows. my dad built this house with his own hands in the 70's, and i had been in the house before they moved in, so it was genuinely sad to see the place like it was. when it's all done and over with, they are moved out, and my dad ends up having to put a little over $30,000 into the house to make it livable. it took three months of work, and even after that a plumber and electrician had to go and fix several problems that were discovered with tests and use. new renters get moved in as soon as possible, all is good and well, but then one day on my way to work i see the rednecks family car parked at the end of the lane. it's an old beater with the bumper and driver door both being different colors from the rest of the car, so it's hard to mistake. our family owned business is where he would usually pay rent, and i'm only at work for about an hour when i am told that i have a phone call on hold. i take the line, and he doesn't hesitate to start in his hard to understand lilt. "hey, this is redneck. my car needs fixed, and i left in the lane. can it stay there for a few days?" i'm grinning, and i almost giggle after i've thought it over for a second. "sure. i don't mind." he hangs up, just like that, and i don't stop smiling as i start to look at local tow companies on the internet. i find the one with the highest rates, at the responsibility of the cars owner, and gave them a call. they even charged hourly for the time their driver was on the road, so i was glad the place was a good while away. after waiting only half an hour after work, the tow showed up, and i was happy to watch as he got the car hooked up. once he got done, i pointed him to the paved area where he could turn around, and then he was gone. it was on the forth day that i got a phone call from redneck's little wife, and i'm certain he was staring at her the whole time, as she politely asked where the car had been sent. "i think someone had it towed." i tell her, with a reassurance that i will call her back as soon as i find out who towed it and where. that was on friday. so guess who didn't hear from me until monday? she answered, and i told her, "hey, i found out it was towingcompany." being as polite as ever, she thanked me, and the line went dead. so that was four business days, and two weekend days, before they got to the car as i imagine they went to get it as soon as they found out. with the rates from their website, i figured out that their bill should have been at least $700. there is no way that these people would have that much money as none of them were employed. their only money came from the two parents who got social security somehow despite only being in their forties/early fifties. that was a year ago, and i've never seen that car on the local streets since. to this day i smile just thinking about it.my dad was in construction in the 80's in chicago and when the economy went bust, he was hired by a company in houston that told him they'd pay his moving expenses after one year of employment. he was brought in to be a general manager, and the company he went to was having problems he was hired to solve. my dad was very efficient and got things fixed quickly. soon, everything was a fine-tuned machine when his one year anniversary came up. the day before the anniversary, he was let go by the company and his job went to the owner's son. they told my dad they didn't have to pay him since the year wasn't up. my dad was pretty pissed about it, and by this time, the economy in houston wasn't so great, so it took a while for him to find a job. when he did, it was for a company that did sub-contractor work from time to time for the company he was let go from. as my dad was hired as an estimator at the new company, he had to bid jobs for his former company. as revenge, he started adding money to each estimate. at first, it was just a little, but over the course of the next 17 years, he would add tens of thousands to each job. even though the money wasn't directly going into his pockets, he did earn much larger bonuses and his employer realized much larger profit margins on the work from the other company. as my dad was retiring, he did an review of all the estimates he ever made for that company and found he'd gotten $2.7 million from them over 17 years. now, my dad didn't get that money (his employer did), but that was $2.7 million that would have stayed with his former employer. so, that $20k they screwed my dad out of cost them $2.7 million over 17 years. he called the greatest caper of his life. he passed away 4 months after retiring, sadly. he giggled about it often though, and he felt vindicated.this is my story of revenge from almost 20 years ago. bear with me, i'm posting this from mobile, and it's a little long, and i'm not the best writer. what i did might not be right or ethical, but sometimes revenge is more important. **the setup** i was fresh out of the military, where i had been a supply clerk, running my unit's warehouse with about 20 guys working for me. the local job market was pretty crappy at the time, the only place i could get a job was a distribution warehouse for a large clothing retailer. the guy who hired me, charles, was former military like me, and an all around decent guy. he was the night shift supervisor. typically this place filled positions with temp workers from the local manpower. if you did a decent job as a temp, the company would hire you as a seasonal worker, and the best seasonal workers would get hired at full time. on average, out of 50 temps, 1 would end up full time. well in the eyes of quite a few people, i fucked it all up because i was hired directly to full time on night shift, with a promise of an interview for management as soon as there was an opening. even though a few of the "old timers" didnt like the way i was hired, i didn't let it stop me from making a few friends, and within six months i was leading one of the teams on my shift, with 10 of us on each team. let me tell you a little bit more about this place, it was like nothing i'd seen before. there were 2 shift, day and night. each shift had about 20 employees per department (divided into 2 teams) and a shift supervisor, the 2 shift supervisors reported to the department manager, and there were 5 department managers that reported to the warehouse manager. there was also it (lots of automation) and maintenance, but most people didn't interact with those departments on a regular basis. in my department we had 4 major job functions; opening, closing, loading, and unloading. in an 8 hour shift, you would typically spend 2 hours doing each, rotating stations between breaks. what made this place unique at the time was the way they tracked your performance. everyone carried around a "gun" that tied into the computer system and tracked literally everything you did. it knew how fast you were unloading, how many units per second you were opening, how many boxes per hour you were closing, etc. the only process that wasn't tracked that closely was loading at each break, you would get a report of how "on target" you were for production goals for each job, in percentage. officially, as long as you were making at least 90% of the goal, you were on target, but anything below 80% would get you a demerit for the day, which would go away if you finished the week above 90%. i was a hard-charger gunning for promotion, so i typically ended the day above 130%. i think my lowest day for my first year there was 110%. at the start of each shift, the supervisors would get a huge text file that had more detailed information about our performance. they would spend a few hours every day analyzing it, and compiling the data in it (by hand) into a spreadsheet that tracked performance for the week, quarter, and year. around my 9 month mark, my knee was injured when some poorly stacked boxes fell on me, and i was put on light duty for a month while i healed. i would still opend and close, but loading and unloading were off the table. charles got the go-ahead from our manager stacy for me to stay in the office for the first 4 hours of the shift, and i would handle compiling the days data into the spreadsheet for him. by the 2nd day of doing this, it was obvious that this job could easily be automated. so i did just that. i wrote a script that would automatically pull the text document off the server, import the data into excel, and populate the spreadsheet for the entire year. i'd done similar stuff in the military, so this was old-hat. by the end of the week, it was working perfectly, and i gave it to charles. this saved him almost 3 hours a day, freeing him to spend more time on the other aspects of his job. even though i had basically put myself out of a job for the remainder of my light-duty, he still let me hang out in the office, and we'd bullshit about life, our times in the service, shit like that. like i said, he was a cool dude. around this time, my wife was pregnant with our second child, which comes into play with what happened next, and turned this all into a revenge story. while i was on light-duty, they had pulled one of the full-timers off of day shift to come run my team. he'd been working there about 5 years, and felt like it was time for him to become a supervisor. he was another high performer like me, mostly due to his drug of choice, we'll call him tweak. tweak was also best friends with the day-shift supervisor, we'll call him twat. tweak stayed on night-shift after i was healed, because there was a rumor going around that charles was up for promotion, which would leave the night-shift supervisor job up for grabs. **pissing me off** sure enough, within 6 months of me writing that script, charles was promoted to manager of another department. having all that free time probably helped, but i wasn't mad because like i said, he was a cool dude and deserved it. he also put in a good word about me taking over his job. charles leaves, and any day now we're all expecting them to post the listing for his job. two weeks go by with no news, and my wife goes into labor during one of my shifts. i drive home, take her to the hospital, and she gives birth to a beautiful baby boy. i'd been working at that warehouse for over a year, so i took my fmla and spent 6 weeks at home, taking care of her and my son. it turns out that our manager stacy had left twat in charge of hiring a replacement for charles. the day after my wife gave birth, he finally posted the opening. he stacked the deck during an incredibly rushed interview process, and tweak got the job. all of this happened within a week of my leave starting. i found out all of this from a co-worker while i was still out, so i used my time off to start looking for another job. by the time my leave ended, i had another job lined up. i won't go into it, but it paid almost 4 times what the warehouse was paying me, and actually sounded like a challenge. heck, i'm still with that company to this day. to be honest, i didnt even have revenge on my mind at this point, i just wanted out, but what happened next pushed me over the edge. my leave ends, but my new job doesn't start for 3 weeks. i wait a week, and give my 2 weeks notice. during that first week, i'm getting warnings about my performance every day. which is bullshit, because my break-time performance reports are still saying i'm at 120+%. i went into the office during my last break on friday and pull up the spreadsheet. it turns out that during my time "loading" (which isnt tracked for performance) tweak had been logging me in as "opening" which was driving my numbers down. at least i woulnd't have to deal with it anymore, as i gave notice that day at the end of my shift. the next week i only worked monday and tuesday. i had 7 days of vacation on the books, so i took them off, leaving me to return on friday, my last day. i checked the spreadsheets at the end of monday and tuesday, he was doing the same shit, so i printed off the evidence, just cya. the next friday i returned for my last day. i had cleaned out my locker on tuesday, so really all i had to do was finish my shift, and collect my final paycheck. instead i'm greeted at the office by tweak and twat, they have a few disciplinary write-ups that they want me to sign. apparently my performance was down all week, and i had a no-call no-show for not working saturday. i was dumbfounded, why the hell would they write me up on my last day, how the hell could my performance be down when i was on vacation, and how could i be a no-call no-show on a day that wasnt scheduled while i was on vacation. i refused to sign, and told them i'd meet them at hr in 10 minutes once i put my lunch away in the break room. **the revenge** instead, i called my sister's husband, a sherrifs deputy, and let him know that these 2 goons had some meth or coke in their desks (they usually did), and walked to hr. i outlined to hr what was going on with my performance, and the writeups these 2 dicks were trying to push on me. tweak and twat came in, and i dragged the whole confrontation out as long as i could. we were in there arguing for close to an hour, when the cops showed up. they had a warrant to search the office in my department, and pulled tweak and twat into the conference room while the search was conducted. twat's area was clean, but they found a baggie of meth in tweaks desk, and a couple of joints in his messenger bag. tweak tried to say that i had planted it in there, but i'd been gone all week, and i had never set foot in the office that day(backed up by security cameras). hr fired tweak on the spot, as he was dragged out in handcuffs. the company placed twat on probation, but he managed to keep his job. that was my petty revenge. the spreadsheet is where it turned pro. as i said, i'd made similar spreadsheets before while i was in the military, and i'd had other people take credit for creating them, and try to pass them off as their own. so i started putting "deadman switches" in them. nothing too malicious, just protecting the cells in each sheet, and it performs a simple check. when you would run the scripts it would pull all the data for the day, but it would also check my personal website for one thing: a multiplier. i run a small email server for my family, its nice having a personal email thats just firstname@lastname.com. it also has a webclient so we can check our email from our browsers. hidden in the html for the webpage is a few variables that i use for different stuff. the spreadsheet i made would pull the variable "warehouse" (which was just set to 1) and multiply or divide every cell and calculation by that. i knew that charles had given twat a copy of the script, and thats what he was using for all his reporting. so when i got home i changed "warehouse" to 1.00023 or something like that. a small enough change that it wouldn't be noticable on daily reports, or even weekly, but the quarterly reports were inflated enough to notice, and the annual report was inflated enough that twat was fired for falsifying data to inflate his bonus. charles let me know about that, he's the warehouse manager now, and he told me over beers a few months later.my high school biology teacher mentioned off-handedly that adding a small amount of a specific chemical to an acidic drink would safely cause normally alkaline urine to turn a vivid shade of red. i had access to the chem storage and i nicked a modest supply. i tested the substance on myself and was pleased to see a shocking color change. my pee looked like cherry kool•ade. cool. i pranked my friends, of course. they were shocked the first time, mildly amused the second or third time, but after repeated assaults, i would generally just hear "goddamit, midzo!" from the bathroom. little fun. i looked for additional targets. the college guy next door seemed a good candidate. i dosed his cola. i didn't know he was a chemistry major. he never said a word, but a week later i peed blue. blue! well-deserved retribution, points for style. pro revenge, indeed.my friends take turns renting a vacation house for a month. i rented a large farm house with pool and housekeeper up the hill from a lovely beach town. six months out all the rooms are filled for the entire stay. my husband gets an email from his sister (my sister-in-law/ sil) saying that she and her mother (mil) will be coming for a visit. i tell my husband all the rooms are taken and send email to sil saying the same and give her the contact for a hotel in beach town. i come home to the farm house late one afternoon to find my sil and mil sitting in the living room. great i think, two more for dinner and no advance warning. i say that i am going up to my room to change. two steps up the stairs my husband says there is a change in rooms. yeap. i get to my room to find their luggage and things all over my room. i sleep on the floor? nah. a side note on mil. no one ever tells her no. our house heated to 80f day/night when she visits in winter and 60f in summer. all lights turned on all the time. her food in frig, yours on counter, etc. whatever. but after 15 years, i had enough. my vacation house (i paid for everything), my rules. i packed up their things, took luggage downstairs and put in their car. saying nothing. went in kitchen. the stove top is filled with pots madly bubbling. mil cooking is the worst. housekeeper has been unable to cook meal we had planned. i got the largest pot, poured all the 'food' in and had the housekeeper help me take pot out, through living room, to edge of forest. dumped it. went back in kitchen, packed up their food, took it to their car. went and stood in front of sil and told her there was no room in the house and they would have to get a room in beach town. turned to my husband and asked him to please escort his mother to their car. i went to the pool where all my friends were and waited. they took the next plane home. no means no. there is more information in the responses. first 2 paragraphs are a bit of backstory , real pro revenge story starts from paragraph 3. tldr at bottom. so i'm on my final year - final semester for an electrical engineering degree. i had completed all my major subjects, however, 5 of us 4th year students hadn't done physics 2 since the first semester. physics 2 is a 1st year subject divided into 3 modules (electricity , optics , modern physics) , but it surprisingly wasn't a pre-requisite for any other subject. however , we needed to take it now to graduate. being 4th year students , we barely went to any lecture or did any coursework since it was a 1st year subject which we didn't take seriously. the first module was electricity and magnetism, for which all the other 4 idiots failed and i did pretty well. in the second module , the other 4 students just barely passed. we are now approaching the final exam in 2 weeks. here is where the pro revenge story begins! for the entire physics course , the labs weigh 35% of the actual grade. there are 9 experiments in total , and we have to submit the lab report of all 9 reports at the end of the semester. i had 4 other final year students in my group., and not one of them would ever help out during experiments. i would literally do the entire lab alone and they would pretend to work whenever the instructor passed by. you know what? it doesn't bother me. sometimes, while i'm working on an experiment , one of them would poke me , or slap the back of my head as a joke. still doesn't bother me much, i can "laugh" it off, whatever. but, what gets to me, is that after 9 weeks of you guys slacking , you message me to complete all the lab reports by myself and refuse to work , telling me, "you didn't let us help you , so we don't know what to do." oh that got to me. i gave you guys a simple task of just plotting graphs with the different data that i had already collected. and you refused to do it. last week was the final day for submission for all the labs. i didn't submit a single one. today we all got a 0% out of 35% for the lab components where, labs - 35% module 1 exam - 20% module 2 exam - 15% module 3 exam - 15% quizzes - 15% the beauty of this , is that even though i lost 35% , i can still pass. they can't. the subject is offered only once per year. in order to graduate now, they have to wait an entire year. tldr: lab group members refused to help in lab, i didn't submit any report and failed everyone and have them repeat an entire year. edit: for the people who ask why i would sacrifice my own grade. (a) it doesn't affect my wam, i'm still graduating with a distinction. (b) when i meet them later on, i can just say , "oh, i didn't submit the lab , because you didn't submit the graphs to me." (c) if i rat them out to the professor, and i get a good grade , they tell everyone that i intentionally failed them. (it's a small university). this way, instead of them blaming me, they can blame themselves.i know i'm not the best story teller, but here it goesthe story is posted in my post history, it's my first post since this is a throwaway. i'm normally a huge pussy due to social anxiety and stuff like that, so i'm really proud of this one. here's the original story: tl;dr for those who dont wanna read the previous post: a kid i was referred to (he's a stranger to me basically) hooked me up, and i trusted him as the middle man. my money disappears, unsurprisingly. the kid stopped taking my calls, stopped answering my texts, so during my deep brooding at 5am in my bed, i hatched a plan. i know this kid is in highschool, so he lives with his parents. he never gave me his real address, probably because he was planning on ripping me off from the beginning. after some facebook stalking that came up inconclusive (i could only find his cousins, but i didn't want to ruin his life completely by messaging them that their cousin is a drug dealer and theif), i checked yellowbooks. all i gotta say is that yellowbooks should be illegal man, i found his address (cross-checked it with where i picked him up, his real address is one street over so i knew it was legit), and more importantly, his home phone number. so, i sent him a simple text. i said "i know you have my money. please return it, or i will call your parents." he didn't reply. after a bit, i sent him his address saying "is this correct?" (i know i sounded threatening, but i apologized to his mother later on saying that i didn't mean to sound threatening.) he says "no." well, obviously he would say that, so i just told him i'd see him later. i asked if his parents are home before 2, and he said he lives alone (which is bullshit), and that he and his guys would be ready to throw down. i told him that i dont wanna fight, and that just wanna talk. i gave him his chance, and he had up until now to return my money. i believe in second chances, but he forced my hand. so, when i got home from classes, i called his mother. i'm a very respectful and polite person naturally, so i made was positive i could talk to his mother about this. i call, ask if this is the (kid who robbed me)'s residence, and told his mom that i'd like to talk to her about his son's behavior. i told her that i have evidence that he stole $260 from me (i took screenshots of everything), and that i approached her because i wanted to settle this as peacefully and as quickly as possible. i explained the situation, and told her that she should change her son's phone number because i easily could have been an undercover cop and that i got both his name and phone number from someone who's basically a total stranger to the kid who robbed me. she thanked me, and i told her that i didn't want to do this but i was left with no options. i promised her i wasn't a thug, and just a normal person. i said that he was lucky that it was me who he robbed, because other people might have attempted to hurt him (which was the recommendation of a lot of people from other posts, but i left that part out). i sent her the messages that showed he threatened me, and i said that i hate violence (which i do) and that i felt that this was the best way to effectively deal with the situation. i left out the part of me wanting to buy an ounce, because that would have scared her quite a bit if she knew how much it was, but she gave me her phone number and told me it'll be sorted out, and that he'll lose his car immediately. she tells me to block his number, i thank her, she thanks me and i tell her that her son seemed like a good person, but i was still robbed nonetheless. i get a text 5 minutes later from the kid saying "fuck you you stupid fuck" and i block his number. i wont be getting my cash back for a while since i'm taking a family vacation for a few weeks, but she promised me i'll get my cash back. at this point, i didn't even care too much about the money, all i wanted was revenge. that sweet, sweet justice boner feels soooo good. as i was feeling depressed and feeling like shit at 1am, dj khaled got me through, and it was these words that helped me create my plan: "never play yourself"this all took place many years ago when i was a freshman in high school. i had bought an ipod nano (hot shit back then!) with money i had earned by helping my neighbor, and as i didn't make much, i was pretty protective of it. my scumbag sister had also recognized that it was worth a few hundred. as i later found out, she had stolen it and given it to a friend (temporarily) until the heat was off. i suspected this immediately when it wasn't on my desk where i knew i left it. i asked my parents if i had done something that warranted a punishment, but neither had touched it. clearly, i needed evidence to pin my sister. as a freshman, i was pretty computer savvy. at the time, i was learning a few programming languages and had a good feel for novice hacking. nothing serious, but enough to get in trouble at school kinda thing. i got to work on a spy tool: my plan was to get into her email and facebook, where i hoped to find evidence. at the very least, i could fuck up her account and get revenge. a few hours of work later, the program was done. and it was way more than a simple spy tool. although i honestly had no idea how to make a spy tool at the time, i damn sure knew how to write a batch file that would fuck your windows partition six ways to sunday. i had basically written a carpet bomb that had the same icon as internet explorer. the virus (can i call it that?) was armed when you replaced the default iexplore.exe file with the malicious file that shared the same file name and icon. of course, when you went to run ie, you set it off. the original file would be launched after the virus ran, so everything was still usable. of course, my original goal was still carried out. i had packaged in a simple keylogger (records keystrokes) that any decent antivirus would have noticed instantly. but once my sister was out of the house, there was nothing stopping me from ripping her antivirus out by the roots. which i did. and then planted the virus. a few hours later, she came home and started her normal computer browsing - log in, open ie, check facebook and email (this was before twitter i guess) etc etc. but today was a little different. she probably didn't notice, but internet explorer lagged a little when she opened it. that was because "internet explorer" had to execute a few little things before it extracted and then launched the real browser application. for instance, a few files (marked hidden, with innocent names) were copied to her startup folder, waiting to execute at the next login. the keylogger was embedded deep into the system and was started right up, and within a minute her passwords were saved in a protected log file. she was completely unaware. of course, that all changed in about 20 minutes. the virus, which was running in the background, ran a fake error message that caused a reboot: "there appears to be a beaver dam obstructing your flow of internet connection. code red, reboot required!" she was somehow stupid enough to not instantly realize that this was some sort of malware/spyware and just patiently waited for the login screen. as soon as she logged back in, the hidden startup files ran and she was greeted with some weird error message and important-looking command prompt windows (which were busy doing important things, like deleting system files and corrupting huge registry chunks). suddenly, she was getting errors about things like her hard drive being jammed with peanut butter, and "windows has detected an intelligence deficit in user. consider a system upgrade." complete with an annoying beep noise every time she tried to close it. her cd tray kept popping open, no matter how many times she closed it. she even got a snarky message ("put it in me babe!") every time it opened back up. meanwhile in the background, a small script uploaded the keylogger file to my ftp account and deleted the keylogging portion as well as the hidden startup files, in case investigation was done. naturally, this triggered her mashing the power button and waiting for the screen to turn off. she knew something wasn't right as soon as she had the login screen: everything was 640x480 resolution. at this point, she asked me to come fix it, because i was the computer nerd in the house. i had to contain my laughter. "just try logging in, this is really weird. i have no idea why this would happen." the desktop was a beautiful pixel collection featuring 256 colors (that was a lot a couple decades ago!) and barely distinguishable icons. her theme was set to windows classic, which she hates with a passion (she's one of those people who spends hours "customizing" the look of the icons, cursors, and other piddly-ass things). unfortunately for her, i had plans with friends and couldn't help her with her computer. sorry about that. all program files and hardware drivers were gone, so she had no luck running a browser amidst the chaos, or even getting an internet connection in the first place. in the end, i got my ipod. i spoke to her the next day and asked for it back. naturally, she claimed not to have it. she didn't know that i had read her facebook messages, and already knew that her friend had it (she and her friend were messaging about how to turn it off or something). i asked my parents right in front of her: "can you ask her to show her facebook messages just so she can clear herself? i thought i heard her saying something to her friend about the ipod and how she would talk about it on facebook." sure enough, she broke down and said that she was "just borrowing it." obviously, my parents forced her to show the messages, which clearly proved how it was a little more than borrowing that she had in mind. my dad recommended that she have someone fix her laptop. luckily, i was around to do it, and for $20 i would be happy to re-install windows. and that, ladies and gentlemen, was how i got even with my sister. i am so sorry this is a god-damn novel, but i hope you enjoyed it. **edit: clarified a few things**when i was a sophomore in college, i got a job as a waitress at a restaurant near campus. it was a pretty small place, so servers often helped out with other things, like dishwashing and cleaning. there were a lot of call-outs (it was a restaurant after all), and i was willing to pick up the hours because money, so within a few months i had gotten used to doing everything. and i do mean *everything.* seating tables, dishpit, running register, even some prep and other things on the line. i had gotten so good at other things that i was put on the schedule for other stations if there were any gaps. i busted my ever-loving butt for that place, all without ever losing my smile, and after a while it began to show. the managers loved me, my co-workers loved me, the customers loved me... it seemed like just about everyone enjoyed working with me. well, almost everyone. the kitchen manager, henceforth known as crazy bitch, was not my biggest fan, to put it mildly. she was nice enough at first, but began to grow cold and distant as time wore on, and eventually became outright hostile. she was bitchy to everyone, but seemed to take pleasure in going above and beyond with me. a few examples of what she did to me include, but are not limited to: - throwing dishes into the pit while i was washing, breaking them. she ran to the manager and tried to blame me. - telling the front end manager to stay in the office with me when i counted my drawer (my drawer was never off the whole time i worked there) - telling new hires to "watch out" for me - constantly dissing me behind my back to others, which i always found out about because people liked me - forcing me to stay later than i already did to "deep clean" various things in the kitchen - throwing away my time-off requests when she thought no one was watching in general, this woman did everything she could to tarnish my name and make my life unpleasant. she was the only bad thing about working at this restaurant, and at times it got so frustrating that i went home and cried. the only person she didn't whine to about me was the owner, and that's only because she was scared of him. he had five other locations around town, and he just went around to each one throughout the week. this will come into play later on. i've always been an introvert who shied away from confrontation, and this resulted in me keeping my mouth shut and putting up with crazy bitch's antics far longer than i should have. now, ten years later, i would have told her where to go from day one, but college sophomore me was shy. besides, this was a temporary job, and i just kept reminding myself that i was going to get a degree and move on eventually. to set the scene-- crazy bitch had been particularly nasty to me over the past week, and i was extra-stressed because it was midterms. i think it was these two factors that led to me finally snapping at crazy bitch. i had just walked in for my shift and was chatting with some co-workers when crazy bitch walked up to me. she asked me why under the ovens weren't clean. i said i didn't know. she said that she had asked me to clean under them last night, which absolutely wasn't true because *i had left two hours before closing* the previous night. i could feel the rage building inside me. i was about to blow up. not wanting a confrontation, i just shrugged my shoulders. "well," crazy bitch said, "i wish you would do a better job of cleaning around here." something inside me snapped. i screamed "you motherfucking piece of shit" as loud as i could. crazy bitch jumped about ten feet in the air and had eyes as big as saucers when she landed. it was now dead quiet in the kitchen-- you could hear a pin drop-- and all eyes were on me and crazy bitch. i jabbed my finger into her chest and said "if you complain about me one more time, i will give you something to complain about!" "well, it's true!" crazy bitch replied. "alright then. i quit." i flung my name tag and apron in her face, walked out of the kitchen, and walked straight out the door, never to return. the kicker-- i was scheduled to do the dishpit that evening. with me gone, crazy bitch would have no choice but to either pull someone off the line and screw up the whole dinner service, or to do it herself. perhaps the story would have ended there, but things were about to go from petty to pro. i got a slew of phone calls that evening from former co-workers (this was long before social media) asking me what happened, telling me how much they would miss me, and/or congratulating me on finally standing up to crazy bitch. one phone call was the manager asking me what happened, and i gave my side of things (and apologized for quitting in such an abrupt fashion). i heard what happened the next day from my former co-workers. it just so happened that it was the day that the owner was due to stop by and check on things. upon arriving and looking around, he asked where i was, since i had worked almost every day for nearly a year. he was informed that i had quit, and that naturally led to him asking why. well, everyone told him. crazy bitch was due to come in for her shift a little after the owner arrived. when she showed up, he was waiting for her by the timeclock. he told her that under no circumstances was she to punch in. effective immediately, she was suspended. she had three days to give him a written letter offering an explanation regarding her behavior towards "one of the best employees he's ever had" (his words, not mine), and if he didn't find it sufficient, she was barred from ever working at a location he owned ever again. so, crazy bitch goes home, writes up an explanation (i still sometimes wonder what she wrote), and brings it in the next day. the owner reviewed it and told crazy bitch that, after a week's suspension without pay, she was allowed to come back and work for him... *as a dishwasher.* i don't know which is funnier, the fact that she was demoted, or the fact that she was desperate enough for a job that she took him up on the offer. crazy bitch went from being in charge of everyone behind the kitchen doors, to being a minimum wage dishwasher. it gets better-- a few months later, sales were down, and in the restaurant business, it is notoriously hard to turn a profit. the owner decided to close the location next to campus, but was kind enough to offer everyone positions at his other locations... well, everyone except one. there is an epilogue of sorts to this story. a few years later, i was shopping at the grocery store when i felt a tap on my shoulder. i turned around and felt my stomach drop when i saw who it was. it was crazy bitch! to my surprise, she apologized for how she had treated me. she said she was going through a divorce at the time and didn't handle it very well, taking it out on the people she worked with. i accepted her apology, and she gave me an awkward little hug before going on her way. so, i guess despite the awful shit she pulled towards me, she wasn't so bad after all.**appetizer -** about six years ago i started my own consulting business. i am a talented engineer, but i was/am sadly naïve about the ways of the world. i came from a nice loving suburban background and my parents taught me that all people are fundamentally good inside. they are not. to quote dr. cox, people are bastard coated bastards with bastard filling. in most cases, i never got any sort of revenge. eventually i realize i’m being screwed, and i fire the individual/cut the contract, etc. and take it as a lesson learned and move on with my life. **main course -** except this one time, when i hired a sales guy. we will call this sales guy “tony.” tony swept in to my office on a cloud of amazing promises. he had a resume a mile long, and many harrowing, unlikely, yet somehow plausible stories of his great sales success in past organizations. he wanted to “partner with me” to take my company to a new level, make more money than we’ve ever made before, etc etc… even better, tony didn’t even want a salary! he simply wanted to be able to take out loans from the company until his big sales pipeline kicked in, and then he would pay it all back from his giant commissions. it was a total win/win for everybody involved! this sounded like an amazing deal. what a nice guy, and clearly confident he could close a lot of sales, or why else would he forgo a salary in favor of loans? i think, friends, it’s probably obvious how this story goes. over the course of the next year, tony “almost” made “so many” “huge sales” that are “totally ready to sign” but somehow, never quiet came through. and in that time he took out over $60,000 in loans that he would ‘totally pay back” as soon as his “monster sales” finally came through. finally, after so many big promises with zero results, i became suspicious. so i hacked open his company email account and saw that, in fact, he had never sent an email to a client, ever. in fact, the only emails he ever sent were to me and other people in my business talking himself up. all of his leads were utterly fake, he had never talked to a single client a single time, in a *year.* **dessert -** so i fired him and set about seeing what sort of revenge i could extract. first, i went to my lawyer, who told me what i expected. no legal routes existed to go after him that wouldn’t cost me way more than i wanted to spend on revenge. second, i hired a pi to dig into him. turns out (surprise surprise) that lots of people are after this guy. former business partners, hospitals in florida (some big medical thing he skipped out on?) and a few others. it was finally my accountant who showed me the best way to get back at him without spending a lot of time or money. as i mentioned, he took out all of his “pay” from me as loans. now that i’d spoken with the lawyer and the pi, i knew i had essentially a zero percent chance of ever recovering that money from him. so i did the next best thing to benefit my business, and to screw him over. i forgave the loans, in their entirety. this had two huge impacts. first, i got a $60,000 tax write off, because the “loans” were now “bad debt” which reduced my tax bill for 2013 to zero, a small but happy victory. second, he now owes the irs $20,000. you see, when i forgave the loan, it became income to him. once it becomes income, full income taxes (including federal, state, payroll, social security, medicare, etc) become due and payable. because it’s not payroll income, i don’t have to pay the employer portion of the taxes. this means he owes the irs $20,000 that he can never escape through bankruptcy or any other means and i have the world’s most vicious attack dog trying to get money from him instead of whatever minor debt collection efforts i could have mustered. **tl;dr** – my friend was raped last month. i found out where the perv lived, and sharpened the edges of the elevator doors in his building to a razors edge. one day, when he came out of the elevator, looking all rapey, i slammed the doors shut and cut him in half. i kept his scalp as a trophy. mechanic lied, said he installed new parts and billed us $1,800 - the week before christmas. that hurt. in march the car broke down. new mechanic says, "nope, these are not new parts ... and even if they were, it would have cost $300." "he said they were new!" "well, see these marks? it means it was rebuilt." to the internet! next day, march 16th. find the owner ... it's a mobil gas station ... find the officers there ... accuse the owner of sexually discrimination against my wife. write letter to dmv ... "pull this guys license" letter to irs and state tax (this guy is issuing false invoices) letter to newspapers, bbb ... i print them up. i show up - my plan, make it hot. more pain to keep the cash than to refund it. i've got my letters, his phony parts and price sheets. the mechanic is not the owner ... ok, call him. "i don't have his number," the crook says. he leaves me and wife alone in the office. wife points to the rolodex ... be the owners # is there. it was! home, office, etc. copy that. mechanic comes back, screaming i have to leave. "i am calling the police! leave!" i leave him my letters ... "you can refund me or i am sending these out. you're going to get audited and you could lose your license!" i go across the street and call mobil to make it hotter. i come back. the cops are waiting for me. gulp. i take a deep breath and explain that this guy charged my wife $1,800 for a repair that should cost more than $300. apparently one of the cops knows cars. "he charged you how much!?" the cop was pissed. "wait here." five minutes later ... the office says your refund is waiting for you inside. a full refund - on the spot. instant justice. i sent the letters anyway. fuck him.so you be the judge of whether this is "pro revenge" or "petty revenge." unlike my past post, the stakes here are small, but it was done in a professional context, my job. i own and manage several mid-size multi-family rental properties (apartment blocks.) i'm very hands on, and i deal with most day to day issues as well as the investment side. great returns this way. i choose most of the tenants personally, and most of them are great people - they appreciate my hands-on work and the fact i love my job and strive to provide the customer service that a good hotel would. there are some exceptions. one of my tenants is a charming young woman with a good job, friendly and easygoing demeanour, and a total douche-bag boyfriend. it was a six-month battle to get him on the lease, since he lives there full-time now and from what i see, doesn't contribute to rent. not my problem though. until, i get a call from him, politely (odd - he's not usually polite) saying he clogged the toilet and asks if i can call a plumber or fix it before his girlfriend gets home. happy that he is being polite, i went on over and was there in 20 minutes. it turned out he had dropped a bottle of hair gel into the bowl, and for some reason flushed it. it was jammed in the p-trap of the bowl, just out of sight but within reach. i got on my elbow-gloves, reached in and pulled it out. he stood watching me with this scumbag steve smirk on his face. i suggested that next time he just reach in and grab it himself before calling me. he looked me dead in the eye and said "i don't reach into toilets dude, i'm going to school so i don't have to touch other people's shit." i told him "you'd be surprised how much that pays though - you bill will be in the mail." i went home, called three plumbing contractors and asked them each what their emergency service rate was - the average was $180.00 for the first 45 minutes flat. i sent a bill to scum-bag tenant for $180.00. he refused to pay, i filed a dispute at the tenancy office, and included in my evidence the three quotes i had received. i got my judgement today - $180.00 plus the $50 filing fee. a ll is allowed to charge market rate to repair damage that a tenant causes intentionally or through negligence. now he knows that. next time he will reach into the toilet himself. all he had to do was keep his dumb mouth shut and i would have fixed his problem for free...so, this will be a wall of text, so be warned, but the story works best if you read it all the way through. when i was fifteen or so, a girl, georgia, started picking on a friend and i. it started out with taunting, teasing and insults, but when we failed to react, it escalated. she eventually resorted to punching us, kicking us, slapping us, slamming our heads down on desks every time she walked past us in lessons, jabbing us with sharpened pencils from behind, and once or twice she even got her posse to help out with a beating or two. we were shy girls, who often attracted bullies because we were introverted and could come across as aloof because socialising wasn't our strong suit. my friend and i usually had lessons apart from each other, so when georgia went for us we were usually separated, and she wouldn't take us on together, even though we never fought back. however, one day, my friend had enough, and said that she'd be leaving school before the next term. she said she couldn't take it any more and wanted to leave. i was really upset by this, because with my best friend leaving, being left alone with my bully and teenage angst all adding up, i ended up with depression. my friend confirmed not long after that that her parents had agreed, and she would be leaving. but, she said, she had a plan to "go out with a bang". now, this was the time before iphones and smartphones (just), but we both had laptops with webcams. our plan began with taking our laptops everywhere we went, and always having our laptops on, and always having our webcams on. we even painted over the little lights that show the webcam is working, so that georgia would never know. we started using our laptops at all times. we got special permission to use them in lessons, me by claiming carpal tunnel syndrome (which was a lie) and her by saying she wrote too slowly (which was true). every time we went to a lesson, we were recording on our computers, and sure enough, we got the footage of georgia's abuse. we got a friend to splice the videos together in a sort of compilation video, to blur our faces, but not georgia's, and to burn the final cut onto a disc for us. the final video started out with georgia walking past me and slamming my face down into the desk. it then cut to her calling me a "worthless cunt", and then again to her spraying ink on my friend's uniform. then it showed a variety of slaps, punches and headlocks, before switching to a close up of her with her arm around my friend, speaking very quietly about how she was going to "wait until the bell rang and then kick the shit out of" her. the video was just under fifteen minutes long, and displayed everything she did, except for the beatings that sometimes happened outside of lessons. so, the day my friend left, we hugged and promised to keep in contact. we then nodded to one another as she got into her mum's car and was driven off. that night, georgia's mother got a cd in the post. as did our headmaster. as did the police. they all watched it, though it took the police longer to get to it. georgia was suspended, but once the video magically made its way to every member of the parents' association, she was expelled. she applied to other schools, but they had seen the video too. in the end she was sent abroad to finish her education. you may ask how we know all this. well, not long after coming up with the plan, my friend and i made a fake facebook profile and added georgia. she accepted it and forgot about it. she was one of those people, even when facebook was fairly new, who posted about everything that happened to her. so a post that said "georgia is seriously pissed about being shipped off to [insert foreign school name here]" was enough for us to send them a copy of the video too. of course she knew it was us, but since she was sent off to another country, she couldn't exactly do anything about it. occasionally i check out her facebook, and she is not doing well as an adult. maybe she shouldn't have pushed two nice girls too far. edit: i can see you guys are wanting to see the video itself, i promise i will think about it, but it isn't just up to me, i would have to ask my friend. and since the school uniform is easily identifiable, i am not sure if there would be some legal issues here. edit2: asked my friend if she'd be ok with me uploading the video to reddit, her response was "what's a reddit?" edit3: ok guys, i've sent a message to a friend who is doing law to see if i could get in any trouble for sharing the video, when it clearly shows the uniform and takes place in the school. i'll take their advice on the matter. edit4: my friend says she's happy to let me share the video, so we'll just see what my law friend says. posted on obvious throwaway account. my main account is tied into my personal information and business, forgive vagueness here as i don't want any repercussions. back in college, i got very interested in a business, which i'll call widgeting. it was closely associated with my major, and i studied it at length, coming up with an idea which i felt could revolutionize widgeting, which was fairly stagnant. the problem is, widgeting is a small field, governed by a good old boy's network, and rarely does anyone get in who isn't a relative of existing widgeters. i was doubly unlikely to break in because i was a woman. knowing this, i got a sales job out of college which supplied, among other things, widgeters. this put me in close contact with a number of widgeters, and let me feel out better if my ideas would fit as well as i originally thought. increasingly confident in my idea, i was asked to run the stand for widget supply company at a trade show. while there, i met the man who had just taken over ownership of widgeting usa, easily one of the most renowned companies.mr. doe was younger, and i had read a local interview with him where he was talking about embracing new ideas. he seemed a great pitch for my idea, which i had on my personal laptop. earlier, i had been in a conversation with several other people and mr. doe, so we had established a contact. then that evening, mr. doe and i were on the same elevator as a few other people, and we started friendly chatting about his business etc. i'm looking to move conversation to my idea when others get off the elevator, leaving mr. doe and i alone. he instantly started getting aggressively grabby on me, touching me inappropriately, and saying that i should come up to his hotel room. i push him off and tell him i'm not interested, and he shoves me back, and sort of gets aggressive, then gets off the elevator and stomps away. the next morning, i'm at the trade show talking to another vendor, who calls over to mr. doe. he asks if we have met, and i say yes, mr. doe says no. as he turns to leave, he leans in and says quietly enough for only i to hear "i don't bother remembering women unless they've had my dick in their mouth." later, i start hearing stories from other people of similar assaults and issues with women who have done business with him or had social contact with him. no one had pursued criminal charges, but he had a reputation i wasn't aware of as a creep. flash forward a bit, and i meet a group interested in investing in their own widgeting company. i pitch them my idea, they loves it, and we move forward with me as a partial partner. my idea actually works well, and we are making a name for ourselves as a young company. my business partners and i are invited to a city event which is semi formal. arriving there, i see mr. doe in the corner, holding his wife's hand. i manage to avoid him for most of the night, but i find myself fixing my lipstick in the bathroom mirror when mr. doe's wife comes up beside me. i couldn't resist. i asked if she was mrs. doe, and she says that she is, and asks if we had met. i tell he we hadn't, but i met her husband. we're making pleasant talk social talk and walk back out together, and mr. doe comes over to us. he introduces himself, and i say that we've met. i give my name and that i am one of the partners at new widgeting co. at this point he starts sort of schmoozing me, saying he has heard of me, and that i was behind the business plan. he is really impressed at how well it is working, but thinks it would work better on a larger scale. if i want to jump ship to an established company, he could use some new blood and fresh ideas. after a bit of this, he asks where we met before, as he can't place me, but he never forgets a face. with his wife standing there, i tell him that we met at x trade show in smarch of 2009. there's a moment of realization on his face, and not able to resist, i turn to his wife. "it's not surprising he can't remember me. he told me then that he only remembers women if they've had his dick in their mouth." i quickly make my leave, and watch from across the room as his wife and he have a minor confrontation in the corner. no raised voices, but a lot of gesturing, wide eyed head shaking, ending in tears on her part. they left the party early. a few days later, i get an email sent to my work address from her, asking what i meant by the comment. i reply back from my personal email account, and outline exactly what had happened. i also add that she can contact the following women with similar stories. (later, it also proved he had two fairly stable mistresses as well, one who was only 18) it's two years since then. my company has grown to be a solid rival of his, while his has been struggling. this is partially because he was investing his own money into instituting new technology into widgeting usa. sadly, he financially was hurt when his wife divorced him. she and i have become surprisingly good friends, and she'll joke about the lack of pre nuptial agreement. tl;dr: sexual assault is always a bad idea. but it will ruin you when your victim is a better businessperson than you are, and your wife can wipe the floor with you.this is a story about my uncle's vengeance. my uncle is chill and friendly, but he once had the misfortune of living next to an awful neighbor. the guy actually didn't have a ton of bad habits, but he did exactly what he wanted to do and he didn't care who it affected. and one of the things he wanted to do was take his big dog on a daily morning walk and let the dog do his doggy business on my uncle's lawn. the first time my uncle caught him, he calmly confronted him and politely requested that the neighbor stop using his lawn as a dog toilet. the neighbor calmly told my uncle to get fucked: he didn't care what my uncle thought, there was nothing my uncle could do about it, and nothing would change. this being 1970s southern california, my uncle couldn't record the neighbor and shame him online or report him to the police for some litter violation, and although he is a cool uncle, he was in no way physically intimidating enough to get this guy to back down. every day for a week he went outside to confront the shitty neighbor and his shitting dog, and every day he got the exact same answer: fuck off, i don't care, and there's nothing you can do about it. on the eight morning, my uncle stayed inside, watching as the neighbor yet again allowed his dog to leave a fudgy dump on his lawn. then, after the neighbor and his dog had continued on their walk, my uncle grabbed a shovel and went outside. he scooped up the dog shit and, with masterful accuracy, flung it onto the roof of the neighbor's house. as mentioned before, this being 1970s california, the neighbor's roof (like all of the houses in that area) had a very shallow slope, and once he saw that the poop didn't roll off, my uncle headed back inside. he repeated the exact same procedure every morning... for the next eight months. not once did the neighbor notice the steadily growing pile of dog shit on his roof, baking and dehydrating in the california sun. not once did he smell anything off, nor did he find it suspicious that my uncle still greeted him in a friendly manner after having his lawn used as a dog loo every single morning. finally, after eight months, the hot and sunny weather gave way to a massive rainstorm. within minutes, the entire crusty layer of dog poop shingles rehydrated and broke free, a reeking mudslide from hell that sloshed down onto the neighbor's property, splattering his lawn, his house, and his car with literal pounds of dog shit. over the next few days, the neighbor's grass succumbed to the poison and died, paint began to flake off his car, and the neighbor himself had to finally clean up after his dog once the sunny weather returned and the remnants of the dog poonami began to dry up while still stubbornly stuck to every stinking corner of his house. tragically, my uncle didn't take any pictures of the poo-house (i would have loved to have seen that). from the day after the rainstorm to the day my uncle moved out of that house, he never spoke to that neighbor again... but the dog poop stopped appearing on his lawn for good.when i was in high school, my first car was a cheap little geo that i'd bought with money i'd saved working my ass off at the neighborhood pizza joint. obviously, it was nothing special, but it was *mine* and i was proud of it. i lived in a very affluent suburb in the midwest at the time though, and a majority of my peers drove much nicer cars -- either daddy's bmw, or a bmw daddy bought for them. i mean, everyone else didn't *literally* drive bmws exclusively, but you get the idea. anyway, i was a junior at the time, and there were a handful of bullies (seniors) who decided that because i drove a dated, inexpensive car, i deserved to be subjected to constant ridicule and harrassment. i was constantly being called "poor" and laughed at for driving "such a cheap piece of shit". in reality, my family was actually decently well off. my parents could've bought me a brand new mercedes if they'd wanted, but they came from nothing and wanted me to earn my first car. and being raised by them i was fine with that. anyway, let's call the leader of this bullying group tad. tad was utterly obnoxious to almost everyone around him, but usually got away with it because he was a) attractive, b) a straight-a student, and c) a talented player on every sports team our high school offered. the whole conflict started one day after school. i was in my little geo, in the line of cars waiting to leave the parking lot. tad was in front of me, in his audi a4. when we were nearing the parking lot exit, tad stopped to lean out the window and chat to some of his friends. i had work at the pizzeria that day and was in a hurry, so being impatient, i sped around him. tad must've interpreted my passing him as some sort of hostile affront to his ego, and sped up behind me. after finally turning onto the main road, he stayed right on my bumper and followed me to work. when i got out of my car, he leaned out the window and called me some names. i ignored him and went into work. when i got out of work 4 hours later, i found both of my mirrors broken. i didn't have proof, but i knew it was tad. luckily my parents felt bad for me and paid for me to have them fixed that week. next week, however, came the straw that broke the camel's back. it was a friday and i'd stayed late after school working on a history paper in the school library. i happened to get out right after the lacrosse team had finished up practice. when i came out to the parking lot, i saw tad standing next to my car. what was he doing? taking a piss on the driver's side door. filled with rage, i ran after him but he managed to get to his car and peel out of the parking lot. at home, feeling defeated as i washed his piss off my car, i decided revenge was in order. i didn't know how, yet, but i knew an opportunity would come. and it did. two weeks later, word had spread around the school that this senior named doug was having a big party the coming weekend. doug was incredibly popular, and i knew tad would be there. i also happened to know tad would be driving his audi there. and i knew where doug lived, and that most of the people, tad included, would be staying the night. i enrolled the help of my two closest friends, ben and josh. both hated tad just as much as i did, though for different reasons, and were more than eager to lend their "help" when i told them my scheme. the night of the party, we waited until 4 am when we knew the party would be dead and everyone would be sleeping. we showed up wearing all dark clothes and plastic gloves. we found tad's car, and much to our amazement (and glee), he'd left it unlocked. we opened the doors and quietly went to work, trying to keep from laughing too loudly. first, i pissed into the air vents. i got out, and josh pissed all over the leather driver's seat. then, it was ben's turn. now, let me tell you, ben is a disgusting human being. he's a loud, funny guy, all smiles and laughter, but he's also just gross. constantly belching and farting. and it always smells so, so rancid when he does. he's the type of dude who takes pride in that. ben pulls down his pants, whispers, "i wonder if he'll be able to tell i had chinese food," squats next to the car, and proceeds to take a shit into his gloved hand. the smell is immediately overwhelming, and horrifyingly gruesome. it's so potent you can taste it. josh and i gag right away, frantically pulling our shirts over our noses and retreating from ben's vicinity. josh can't take it, runs over to a tree, and pukes his guts out. ben laughs and says, "oh my god that is sick, sorry!" while we're watching from a distance in both horror and amusement, ben takes his shit and just starts smearing it **everywhere**. all over the door handles, the steering wheel, the air vents, the radio knobs... he eventually starts gagging and coughing and retreats himself, but not before wiping his ass with the lacrosse jersey tad had left in the back seat. we couldn't stop laughing on the walk back to josh's house, but once we were back, josh made ben take a shower (thank god). the following monday there were a lot of whispers going around the school. here's what i eventually learned happened: 1. the morning after the party, tad discovered the nightmare in his audi, in front of everyone else who was leaving. 2. tad went into a rage, but apparently almost everyone thought it was the funniest thing they had ever seen. 3. when tad's parents discovered what happened to the car they'd purchased for their son, they also discovered tad had been to a party and had been drinking. i guess his parents were not cool with it -- they took away his car for the rest of the year and tad was told he had to ride the bus for the remainder of the year. 4. his parents eventually gave him the car back several months later, but no one wanted to ride in "the shitmobile" because of what happened, and because he never got the smell completely out. tad's bullying surprisingly died down a bit after that. he didn't mess with my car again. **tl;dr -- bully in high school smashes both of my mirrors and pisses on my car. me and my friends unleash a torrent of shit and piss all over the inside of his, and his once cool audi came to be known throughout school as "the shitmobile"****cross posted from tifu after mods took it down. i received a bunch of surprising comments! thanks to whoever gave me gold!! i was shocked!** *edit* holy jesus! thanks for all the comments and ups! and special thanks to /u/ihatecraptcha for the gold. you guys have been amazing. definitely makes me want to post more often! thanks again. *original post - obliged to say this happened in 1990 when i was in 5th grade and this is my first tifu. i was a nerdy kid coming from a military family. i had friends, sure, but kind of a loner and tended to stay by myself in the lunch room, actively avoided group projects, you know, the usual type of growing up an outcast type of thing. there was this kid in my same class, lets call him sam. now, i never had a problem with sam in the past. i remember seeing him for the first time in 3rd grade and we got along fine. i didn't bother him, he didn't bother me, i continue reading my nintendo powers until the teacher tells me to stop slacking. it was all fine. until fifth grade. 5th grade was a turning point for sam. he had hit some sort of brutish growth spurt and started pushing people around. he eyed me as an easy target. this all started in the beginning of the school year and continued for five months. it began with flicking bits of paper. ok whatever. big deal. it stopped for a while. then paper clips and rubber bands. ow, but no marks so no need to tell anyone, not that i would have anyway being the awkward antisocial boy i was. sam soon stopped and raised the bar of bulliness by talking shit to me. the usual early 90s jabs were used and silently rebuffed. he knocked my food down onto the floor. sam, however, never got in trouble. he was the sneakiest of the sneaks! he was the shadow of the elementary school. sam got away with everything due to adults either not seeing it happen, or not caring. so, it's early february and its the end of p.e. class. i make it to the coveted front of the line and await my classmates for the best part of school, the library. as the rest of the class lines up behind me, here comes sam. he barrels through to the front of the line shoving me out of the way. by this point i've hit my breaking point. i must have watched rocky iv the night before. i decided this would be the time to take my stand against the evil oppressor. i hear the battle cry in my head as i defy this bully and impose myself by shoving him back. what a feeling! why did i wait so long? sam pushes me. hard. i'm shocked. no one should have to give up their front of the line status. i was the one who made it first. who haphazardly tied his shoes to make it in time. i was the one who deserves this spot of spots in the line that every other 5th grader desired. i push sam back. at this point, sam is absolutely shocked. his eyes are wide and full of disdain. the redness of anger is flooding his skin. sam punches me in the eye. hard. i drop like a burlap sack. tears are flowing and i'm sobbing. i'm crouched on my knees and sam laughs at me. just laughs. straight guffaws. each staccato laugh just makes me see red. i'm pissed. this kid just punches me in the eye, and i go down. this is not how the movies show these situations to be! this is not how rocky would happen. my classmates are laughing at my disgrace. sam is still laughing, tongue sticking out and just rubbing it in my face that i'm crying. so, i yelled out as loudly as i could the war cry that echoed in my head. i stick my fist straight up and with eyes closed so tight, i give this kid the hardest punch i can muster. i uppercut him in the jaw so hard, i broke my middle finger. my eyesight returns and i look at him. he's on the floor screaming and crying in a bloody mess. about five feet away, i see a bloody fleshy glob of unknown. sam is holding his mouth and i put 2+2 together. i just punched sam so hard he cut off his own tongue with his teeth. sam is wailing in agony. the gym teacher runs up and forces me to the side wall while an ambulance is called for sam. i didn't feel bad at all. the amount of pain and anguish this kid put me through was equivalent to the pain that he was going through. the ambulance took him away and i was straight to the principal's office with an ice pack to my eye. i'm awaiting punishment outside the office while my dad's called. while waiting, my classmates who saw the whole exchange spoke with the principal, one by one. finally, my mother and father arrive with a mix of disappointment, caring, and anger on their faces. i finally get pulled into the principal's office with my parents and tell them my side of the story. i tell them the whole ordeal from the beginning of the year to the present. the principal and my parents stay quiet, with the most stoic faces you have ever seen. it's dead silence for what seems like an eternity before the principal speaks up. "son, i am extremely disappointed in how you handled the situation. you are suspended for a week due to the end result of your actions." i don't remember the rest of what he said. by that point, my middle finger was swollen to what looked like a bratwurst and i just wanted the day to end. my parents escorted me out of the school, brought me to the hospital to mend my finger. during the ride to the hospital, my parents told me they were proud of me for standing up for myself so i wouldn't be punished at home. i spent that week watching bugs bunny cartoons with an ice pack on my eye and a smile on my face. i never saw sam again. i remember rumors that he switched to a different school in the area. as an adult i feel bad for the amount of damage i did to him, but that little 5th grade nerd boy still in me is still glad that the wrongs have finally been righted. tl;dr got in a fight after being bullied for half a school year, got tired of it and uppercutted the bully's tongue from his mouth.back story : i grew up in a military family (mom got knocked up at 18), my dad was gone all the time because of deployment, and my mother was in it for the money. this lead to her drinking, whoring around, and the physical abuse of me and my younger brothers for years while my dad was away. she made my life hell any way she could. well, go figure she cheats, gets caught and my dad kicks her out after finding out about the abuse. she comes to my dads house while he is gone unannounced to take some of his things (coffee maker , tv, really petty things that she "needs" for her apartment he got her ) well as she is making her way out the door from the kitchen she says to me. "i hope you know that you are why your father and i divorced, you should feel ashamed of your self " i fucking exploded. "no! you and dad split up because you were too busy drinking and sucking cock to see your relationship falling apart, too see what a shit mother , what a shit person you are!" the words will always be as sweet as the moment i said them. she was instantly pissed, and i could see what was about to happen as she came around the counter and gave me one swift hit to the face. i was still pumped up from what i said to her, and for the first time, i hit back, and it scared the crap out of her. i will never forget the look on her face as i picked up the phone and started to dial 911 and said "you are so fucked." police arrive, bitch is charged with going into my dads house with out his say so, trying to take his things, and hitting me. td;lr : i stand up to my abusive mother on her way of being kicked out of my dads house, with some witty words and a nice defense punch to the face. she is charged and locked up. i posted this in /r/pettyrevenge and someone suggest i submit it here. it feels nice to get this off my chest. edit: just really want to say thank you, i have gotten a lot of support out of sharing this story, and it means more to me than you guys might think. i have come a long way from that day, but i still have a little bit to go, and your support has really given me that extra push to let me know i was in the right. thank you so much. i'm calling this pro revenge because of the amount of work involved. but we've decided the work was worth it. . . for nearly 10 years, my family has lived next door to a gentleman who lived alone. ours is an historic neighborhood, double city lots, with lots of hedges, bushes and trees to provide privacy. also, i tend to be fairly easy-going about what others do on their own property. i really didn’t care when our neighbor began illegally storing his large “toys” in his backyard. due to the screening, i was the only neighbor who had to see his boats, ice house, teepee (yes, a full-sized authentic teepee – i never asked why he put one up). and so i never complained. and when he turned his home into a duplex, without benefit of building permits or inspections, and in violation of current zoning, again i never complained. i guessed he was now retired and needed the rent money. in any event, we’ve never had a problem with any of his tenants. similarly, we never heard a peep out of him regarding our property. not that we had any code violations or anything, but we did have a yard full of loud children and dogs for many years. and there was that one winter when we built a luge for the neighborhood kids that ran the entire fence line of our yards. anyhoo . . . then our neighbor got a new girlfriend. i’m going to call my neighbor “dragged around by my dick”, or "dick" for short. his girlfriend will hereinafter be referred to as "martha", as she was a martha stewart wannabe. martha quickly moved into my neighbor’s home, and began altering it as she saw fit. the first thing we noticed was that dick’s neon sign collection was no longer visible through his windows. ahh – those bygone bachelor days. then dick’s backyard toys were all sold. no more carefree days spent fishing for dick. i’m guessing the proceeds went to the new patio furniture that soon appeared. also, a second, new patio was built onto the side of the house, because the backyard patio got too much sun for martha’s taste. and since martha didn’t want dick’s cat spraying the new patio furniture, she made dick give the cat away to his son. that last one made me a little sad; the cat had been dumped in our neighborhood a few years back, and dick had seemed happy to have his little friend. but, again, not our business. finally, new landscaping was installed throughout their backyard. that also made me sad because the historic plantings that helped make our neighborhood unique were ripped out and replaced with mcmansion-style beds filled with wood shavings and japanese maples. if that was all martha did, i’d have no real problem. if dick was willing to put up with it, why should i care, right? but then she turned her attentions to our yard. first she asked us to replace the historic wire fencing between our yards. dick offered to split the cost, so we agreed. the old fencing had seen better days and the new chain link fence was quickly hidden by ivy and lilac bushes. good neighbors, ok? then martha decided that we weren’t cleaning up after our dog quick enough and called out the compliance officer. in fact, we picked up after our dog daily – but at the end of each day, not after each dump. (that’s a personal ick-factor of mine. i can’t stand picking up warm poop.) the compliance officer told martha we hadn’t violated any laws while giving me a head’s up on my new neighbor. strike one. a few weeks later, i had a knock at the front door. it was the landscaper who had done dick’s yard. martha had called them out to my address, without my knowledge or consent, to provide us with an estimate! estimate for what, you ask? well, martha had suggestions for new flower beds, as well as some trees she thought i should remove because they cast too much shadow on the back half of her yard. these were two-story tall, 80+ year old oak trees! i apologized to the landscaper and sent him on his way. and my husband grumbled to dick that our yard was our business, not martha’s. strike two. finally, martha decided our gardening shed, tucked behind our garage, had to go. i’ll admit, it was a rather utilitarian shed, but it was in good shape, fresh paint, and was heavily screened on all three sides by tall bushes. in fact, i only learned about martha’s complaint because i found a city inspector wandering around my yard looking for the shed. because of the way it was situated, the only way someone not actually in my house could see it was if they were hanging out dick’s second-story bathroom window. i kicked the inspector off my property, and called my councilman to put a stop to the city’s ‘partnership’ with martha. it was then i found out why martha wanted the shed gone. turns out, martha really just wanted the screening bushes gone. she had plans for a third patio (!) and fire pit for the back half of dick’s yard. martha was worried, however, that the heavy bushes on the back half of our yard were encouraging mosquitoes, and she and dick wouldn’t be able to properly enjoy their evenings by the fire. she figured that if she forced us to tear down our shed, we’d then also tear down the screening bushes, and her mosquito problem would be solved. strike three, martha, so time for some pro revenge. since we really didn’t use the shed any longer, we tore it down. we also removed the screening bushes. then we watched martha spend a few days harassing a couple of handymen who built her patio and fire pit. it was snugged up right against our fence and looked really lovely. then we decided that, as good citizens of planet earth, we needed to be more environmentally proactive. so we installed a composting pile right where the shed and screening bushes had been located. after all, it’s at the back of our yard and tucked behind the garage, so it really doesn’t impact our enjoyment of our yard. and now every evening, we take all our food scraps, potato peelings, coffee grounds, egg shells, watermelon rinds, etc., and add it to our large, healthy compost heap. every month or so, we add some goat manure from our friend’s farm. turns out goat manure is a “can’t miss” addition for nitrogen-rich compost. some shredded newspaper doesn't really look good, but it does help balance the carbon content. late afternoons and early evenings, about whenever martha lights a fire, really, one of us heads out to the composting and gives it a good turning. after all, a well-aired compost heap is a happy compost heap. dick and martha never said anything, even though compost heaps do add to mosquito populations. **tl/dr:** martha stewart convinced us to exchange our lilac bushes for a pile of garbage. ok so time i parked my ford escape in the drive way on my step fathers side cause my mother had said she was almost home and not to park on her side. well i forgot to move my car back over once she got home and my step father took offence to this. instead of asking me to move my car like a rational human being he decides to ram his dodge ram into my escape and force it out of the way. unfortunatly the bars i had on the front [looked like this] ( did far more damage to his truck than expected. so i hear the racket and go to see what was causing the noise only to find my suv at the end of the driveway and him staring at the back end of his truck. he then turns to me and says that as soon as he gets back from his errand i had better have the money to fix the damage. well as soon as he left i called the cops and reported a hit and run. gave them the licencse plate number and his discription. i then called the insurance company and told them the same story, gave them the licence plate bladabladabla. so fast forward about an hour and a half. my mom gets a call from my stepdad at the police station. saying he needs to be picked up. we have a huge screaming match as soon as he gets home which ended in him taking my car keys from me and claiming he was going to sell my suv, to which i reply that the vehicle is in my name so he can't do shit. oh btw there was next to no damage to my vehicle from the impact. i'm just glad that he didn't have his trailer hitch on. next morning suprise surprise my suv is gone. so i confront my stepdad about it. he looks me straight in the eye and says " i told you i was going to sell the piece of shit and that is exactly what i did." so while he was still glaring at me i pulled out my trusty phone and called the cops again, this time to report a stolen vehicle. as soon as i told the cops his name, he took off running (his truck was still in impound). this time i go to the police station with my mother. when the cops ask if i want to press charges i just told them if he gives me my suv back then no but if he refuses then yes, yes i would like to press charges. turns out he "sold" it to his brother ie. he stashed it at his place until i payed for his truck, cause the insurance company refused. needless to say my mother and he were not married much longer after that. tl;dr: stepdad was an asshat, rammed my suv out of his way, demanded i pay for the damages. i called the cops, stepdad gets arrested for hit and run. stepdad then steals suv and basicly tells me he did it. i call cops again and back to the police station he goes. mother and stepdad get divorced. *edit: changed the beginning so it didn't sound like i was anwsering a question nobody asked.before i begin, please note that i’ve worked in food service, everyone involved in this story has worked in the food service/bar industry at some point in their lives, and i am a strict 20% or more tipper, regardless of service. so many things go wrong during a “bad service experience” that is either happenstance or coincidental that blaming the server is usually misguided at best and malicious at worst. all that said, this woman was a piece of work. a few years ago, i was involved with a theatre company as a director and actor. sometimes i’d help out with their fundraising, and we were gathering a committee together of about 8 people to meet at a bar/restaurant and chat through plans on a weeknight in queens. to set the scene: it's a small bar/grill, probably about 15 spots at the bar and 10-15 tables. the place was half full, and our group accounted for about a third of the patrons in the joint. most of us were drinking, some of us were eating full meals, and a couple people were only staying for a short while so they just had water or a soda. the bartender was covering all the tables as well as the bar. you'd think that would make her busy, but somehow it didn't faze her. while we waited on refills and silverware, she was content standing by the bar and talking to her friend. the conversations with the friend would make it into the 10-15 minute territory, while all of us were doing our best to catch her eye when we needed another beer or someone new arrived. i had two beers during the evening, and i would have loved to have had four since we were there for a while. when we were able to get her attention, the bartender would shuffle over, take an order from one person, and turn to walk away! when someone would stop her and say, "hold on, sorry, i need something as well," she would sigh, loudly, and turn back, all while rolling her eyes and cocking her head to the side, as if to say "fine." she didn't write anything down, she forgot drinks and meals, and was just all around the worst server any of us ever had. even after all this, i was still planning on tipping the standard 15%. that is, until she came over with the check (after another long conversation with her friend at the bar), threw it on the table, and said loudly to our group "the next time you guys come in here, everybody has to order something." before storming away. we were all dumbstruck. our group accounted for probably half the money running through the place that night, and we would have been ordering a lot more from the bar if she'd ever bothered to check on us. the group decided unanimously to leave a shit tip, none of us had ever been treated so poorly by a server. i left a dollar or so, most people left coins or nothing. the high point of the evening was when we were on our way out. she picked up the check off the table, and yelled after us, "oh, nice. fine. get the fuck out of here and never come back!" as everyone in the entire place turned and stared. my friend went over to her and said "i'll tell you exactly why we gave you what we did," but the bartender was having none of it, continuing to scream "fuck you, get the fuck out! the revenge: that night, i went onto every restaurant review site i could find: yelp, greasy spoon, some local nyc sites. you name it, i told the story in as many characters as the sites would allow. i was so steamed, i had to vent somewhere. i also found out the next day that multiple people from our group had done the same thing. it felt satisfying enough. at this point, i only thought of it as a petty revenge, but it soon became pro... a few weeks later, i was talking with a friend of mine who got hired at this bar. i told him the story, and he said "that was you guys??" i asked him how he knew about the incident. he told me that the bar owner took online reviews very seriously. when he saw all the terrible reviews come in on the same night, with the same story, he knew exactly which bartender it was. she was fired the next day. tl;dr, after receiving the rudest, worst service and being treated like shit, my group used social media to get revenge and improve our neighborhood bar. it's now one of my favorite places to go, and the current staff is all very cool.credit all goes to /u/gromby happened to my best friend, but i was involed in the "cruel" part. so my friend got out of the navy and moved back to the area. after a few months he started dating a woman who had a child with another man before him (the kid was around 8 or 9 years old). fast forward to 8 months later: still together and her kids birthday comes up so my friend buys this kid a go kart. like a really nice, really fast go kart. he teaches the kid how to drive it, how to be safe, gets him a nice helmet and gear and then takes the kid out every week driving in the gokart (my friend had his own). so fast forward about 5 months and his girlfriend is being very strange. shes starting to act distant, not answer texts as much, ignores calls, etc. my friend doesnt think much of it but one day after that he gets a call from the kid...the kid calls him and starts to cry about his gokart (he hasnt heard from the girl in 2 days then the kid suddenly calls) welp turns out that this girl was cheating on my friend with another guy...who had a kid...and she took the go kart from her kid and gave it to the other guys kids. my friend wasnt having any of this....so he gets me and one night we go over to this dudes house, sneak into the back yard and steal the go kart back. its destroyed, the from is all banged up, and the back left wheel is broken off. we grab it and run. next day my friend confronts the girl and she admits to cheating on him...with this dude...for months. she started to get into hard drugs and her child was beginning to suffer because of it (wasnt eating right, missing school, clothes always a mess). the guy shes been cheating on him with is a big drug dealer so my friend goes to the cops. fast forward 6 months....the drug dealer is arrested, the mom loses the kid, kid is living with the grand parents. the grandparents look at my friend as a big brother and let him take him out on sundays to play with his go kart and has become a very big part of the kids life. the mom is not allowed to see the child without supervision. the father of the child finds out about this and becomes really good friends with my friend (hes an airforce vet) and thanks him for everything he did for the kid. short version: friend catches a girl cheating and screwing over her own kid, has to steal a gokart from another kid, gets mom arrested for drug abuse and child abuse, becomes a big brother in the kids life and made a new friend. edit: since people missed it up top: all credit goes to /u/grombyyears ago i had a nasty breakup with my ex of 8+ years. we had a house, dog, no kids, but overall plenty to fight about. eventually; so tired of it all, i told her she could have the house. she was in love with the place and wanted to die there. i just wanted out. the house was underwater on the mortgage since i had bought it just before the real-estate crash. i offered her 10k in order to get out of it. with that, she could pay down the loan and refinance it in her name. i moved out. 1.5 years go by, and she starts the refinancing process. i moved 3 times during this time (to my parents and twice for work). i’m finally buying a new house. although i had all of my small stuff out of her place, i still had a pile of tools, some appliances, and other misc. things. i left it all there because i didn't want to just leave her high and dry for essential stuff. at this point, she had 1.5 years to replace it all. the refinancing is finally going through and i gave her 5700 in cash, asking her when i could come and pick up my stuff. she says i can grab the tools after i give her the rest of the cash, but the appliances and some other stuff were hers. this was not what i had agreed to. i refused to give her another penny. she sued me in small claims court. the judge went down the list of stuff i was asking for. he asked my ex in each instance if she paid for or contributed to paying for any of it. to her credit, she told the truth that she had not paid a cent. in total, there was about 13k worth of appliances and other stuff. the tools weren't included because she said i was welcome to pick them up any time. the judge said he had to do some math. he ordered that i had to pay 2400 in addition to the 5700 i had paid and we were square. that i could live with! i asked when i could pick up my stuff. the judge looked puzzled and said, "oh well it's hers now. pay up and you are square." ms. ex loved that and gets this huge smirk as were walking out of the courtroom. i ask her when i can meet her to pick up my tools. she just looks at me with a shit-eating grin and asks "what tools?" at this point, i had spent years pandering to her to keep things civil and now that she didn't need me anymore, she was trying to steal everything she could get her hands on and get out of dodge. now the revenge: ms. ex worked in the healthcare industry and had access to medical records. of course she abused that to screw with me when i started dating again. she would pull up stuff and tell me to stay away from so and so "for your own good". she foolishly had this in writing over email so when she decided to outright steal from me, all bets were off. i reported her for a hippa violation and her ass was fired the next day. her entire career was around that industry and she will never get work in it again. she took my house, dog, and a hell of a lot of other stuff, but we’re square now. :)my mother was a horrible person (as an example, she once told me my father was going to die after he'd had a heart attack, but she'd already found out from the doctor that he was going to be ok. i was 8 years old at the time, and it was simply done to make me cry.), but in her later years she had codp, and my sister and i, who both hated her and had good reason to, had to nurse her for 9 years until she died (my father had done the bulk of her caring until he passed away). in these years she did her best to cause trouble for as many people as possible, but mostly the two of us. fortunatly for us we had worked out the ways she'd try and would often be able to head her off at the pass. we had a deal between us that if she went too far the offended party could take a break from looking after her and the other would pick up the slack for a few weeks until the air had cleared a bit. in 2008 she'd really offended my sister's youngest daughter, so she took a break. my mother then pulled a usual stunt she had when she felt she wasn't getting enough attention: she starved herself until she was so ill she needed hospitalization. i got a phone call from my sister one morning telling me our mother had phoned her and was so very *ill* and she wanted my sister to go to her house and wait with her for the doctor to come (in other words, she wanted attention). my sister asked me to do it, and i did, but i decided to take a book and read it whilst i was there. it was a very apt book that i picked simply to get revenge on her, as i knew she'd be too nosy not to ask what it was about. it was a hardback book, the title written very boldy on the cover: when a child kills: abused children who kill their parents. i sat and read it for 3 hours beside her sickbed, until the doctor arrived. after she saw the title she barely said a word the whole time. the doctor arrived and told her she wasn't ill enough for hospital. amazingly within a couple of days she was a lot better, and she didn't pull that stunt again for about a year. in 2010 i was having a break from her and she did the same thing to try to get my attention. this time she went too far, ended up with kidney failure and died. whilst registering her death the offical asked if we needed any extra copies of her death certificate and i said "only if you have a framing service." so one of my brothers is adopted and is amazing. he didn't get anything handed to him in life and he's seriously one of the hardest working people i know. just as he was starting his own family he had even more financial burden due to some medical problems. still, somehow he managed to build half a house on some land my dad sold him. he used the equity in that to get a second loan and finish it (and he had to fight the bank for that even). time goes on and he begins to do really well -- so he sells the first house he built at a profit and buys some land. like, 175 acres in the midwest (he lives in a rural area). he likes to hunt and does some farming on the land but the house that was there when he bought it isn't ideal, despite some major improvements and renovation. so he builds a third house and puts the house up for sale. he keeps the land around the house for hunting (this is important later). this is when one of his envious family members asks if he and his wife would consider selling them the house. they can only qualify for something like half of what it's worth, but my brother is a fairly generous guy -- he agrees to sell the house to them at a rather hefty discount since they're family. i'm sure he felt some of their pain as well -- he'd had his own difficulty back when he was starting out. the bank agrees to loan them the money (they can't go wrong, it's for way less than the property is worth) and the deal is done. a few short months go by. he's driving by the property and spots a for sale sign. he stops in and the husband explains that there were some things about the house they weren't happy with, so they were planning on selling it and buying a house more in town or something (etc). my brother explains that they got a sweet deal only because they were family and that he'd appreciate them selling the house back to him for what he sold it to them for. the husband basically closes the door on that -- and my brother leaves. and he thinks about it. i'm 100% certain that the family members understood that they were getting a good deal because they were family and he was happier selling it to them with the understanding that they weren't to take advantage of his good graces. this is a guy, by the way, that manages big projects. he's a really fair guy. the stuff he does in construction probably half of you have driven over -- big bridges that go over rivers like the mississippi for example. he's used to solving hard problems. this one isn't that hard. the next day he drives out with some fence in the back of his truck, and the family members in the house wake up to some fence posts being driven into the ground. the husband comes out. "what's going on?" he asks. "i'm just putting up some hog fence on my property. don't worry, it's all on my land -- i'll just go around your house here and put a gate in so you can get in and out." the husband is a bit perplexed. "you're bringing in pigs?" and my brother was seriously set to do it too. he had about 100 lined up from a farmer down the road. the husband goes back into the house. a few minutes of "discussion" occur. the next day they all meet at the bank and the deed is transferred back to my brother. and he didn't even have to deploy the hogs... tl,dr; family tries to take advantage of my brother on a real estate deal -- he threatens them with living in pig shit.i was originally going to post this as a comment to a story in petty about the inappropriate use of a roommate's kitchen utensils, but as i wrote it out, i realized it bit too severe for pettyrevenge. i had a roommate in college who was a nightmare. she always tore up my dishes, my pots and pans, used my shampoo, wore my jeans- never asked permission, just walked into my room and took whatever she wanted. she had nothing of her own, i swear. my pots were just parts of a cheap set from target, but they were all i had. the last straw was when she ruined one heating it up with nothing in it (why? the world may never know.) i put all the pots and pans in my bedroom and kept my door locked after that. i also banned her from touching anything i owned or had purchased. i resorted to petty shit like "these are my eggs" and "that is my remote." i was young and entirely too salty for my own good, i will openly admit. she was so upset after a week of being denied part ownership of my things that she ended up insisting that i move out. bold move, honcho, considering it was my name on the lease, not hers, and i had been letting her live with me without putting her name on the lease. *and* "we" had another two months on "our" lease. but ok, fine, sounds great to me, bubbles! so i went to the landlord and informed him i wanted out of my lease. he was used to students bopping in and out -college town-, and he said as long as i could find a sublessor and give up my deposit to that person, i could leave early. naturally, he didn't know (or probably care- they were seedy college apartments) that i had an illegitimate roommate who wasn't on my lease. guess who got a new roommate curtesy of craigslist, exactly two days later? not me! i couch-surfed with a friend across town until getting a better job and my own apartment. this sounds harsh for a burnt pan, but earlier in the year my dog bit her. he nipped her hand; there was no broken skin, just one hell of a bruise. he nipped her hand because he was in my room and she came in on her own accord when i was not home and reached over him, and the threshold to my door, to open my dresser. i had a baby gate blocking him in my room, so she had to admit that's what had happened, but said she needed "her necklace" that was mysteriously in my room. her parents bullied 20 year-old-me into giving him away because i was young and scared of getting in trouble. i was paying my own rent and needed her half. i ended up agreeing to give the dog away to a friend. the whole ordeal was terrible. shortly after that, she got a cat. i think the whole thing was a set-up so she could get a cat without my dog trying to eat it. back to the chinese roommate. guy found my ad, said he and his wife would take it, and they were at the door to the leasing office to sign papers that next day. she was livid. her parents were livid. she had told them she was on the lease, and they had been paying for half the rent, so the sudden realization that she was lying and that she had nowhere to live was a bit exciting for everyone involved on that end. but there was nothing they could do- it was my apartment and i had the right to sub-let it, as she was not on the lease. bitch, don't use my pans. i would like to note that i have mellowed quite a bit in the past several years. i also lived alone after that until i met my husband five years later, so maybe that helped. i never apologized for forcing her to live with a random chinese man and his wife, though. and i have no idea how long she was still there with them until she moved- he had the right to kick her out. i assume he did. so maggie, i'm sorry i possibly forced brief homelessness upon you when we were sophomores in college. also, fuck your cat. tl;dr bitch, don't use my pans. i worked in an office building for a large well known company when i was younger. i was an intern living in the city making almost nothing solely for getting my foot in the door with this job. everyone there was nice and i was learning a lot in the field i wanted to enter. as far as i could tell things were going well. that is until i had to deal with a certain incompetent manager. we’ll call him wank stain (ws). i had been working my job for about four months at this point and it was a real bust your ass kind of internship. no get coffee and print this. it was here are a stack of reports, review them, learn, present to the team and eventually company board members. every day i was hitting the work hard, meeting difficult deadlines, and doing everything i could to get the job done. i got there before the sun rose and left well after it had gone down. i was dedicated to this job and was determined to get everything i could out of it. so being as this was an internship i was required to fill out a weekly timesheet. this was signed by a manager in my department to pass onto finance for them to calculate my paycheck off of my hourly rate. up to this point i had no issues with anyone signing it or turning it in. this particular week most of the mangers in my department were traveling on business as was common in our industry. not just an hour or two away but to the other side of the planet for weeks at a time kind of travel. it was a friday and i needed my sheet signed. now every manger is familiar with signing sheets and they don’t think twice about it even for people who aren’t members of their particular team. my manager and everyone else i would normally go to were away so enter ws. now i was pretty familiar with ws but i had never worked one on one with him. i had heard several stories around the office during my time there that he was a bit of a prick but had not witnessed anything directly. that would soon change. me: excuse me ws, could you sign my timesheet? x, x, x, x, and x are away this week on business. ws: hmm . . . do you work here? it should be noted i’m wearing a company shirt and pants with the logos on both, my company badge hanging from my belt, and i've been working there for four months about fifty feet away from this man while also attending the same daily meetings. me: (momentarily taken aback) yes, i've been here a few months now. would you mind signing this? ws: (sees it’s a timesheet) i won’t sign that. me: umm . . . . why not sir? ws: you don’t work directly under me. i don’t know if you have shown up to work all these days. me: sir, i haven’t missed a day yet and i sit right over there. (points to desk within shouting distance) ws: (acts like he’s getting annoyed) you need to get x to sign it, not me. me: sir, as i said before x, x, x, x, and x are gone this week. this has to be turned in today before i can leave. if i don’t i will not be paid for my work this week. ws: (lets out disgruntled sigh) fine . . . i’ll email x and ask if you have actually been doing your work. me: sir, x is all the way in china. it’s 3:00am there now. he won’t respond until he wakes up and happens to check his email. ws: well that isn’t my problem. you mother fucker me: sir, this was the last thing i was going to do today before i left. i can’t leave until it’s signed and turned in. ws: leave it here and hope x replies then. i won’t sign until he does. me: (sigh) fine, i’ll be waiting at my desk if he does. half an hour goes by, no signs of progress one hour mark, i head to his desk to check on this me: sir, has x replied to the em . . . ws: no, he hasn’t! you’re just gonna have to wait! . . . must . . . not . . . strangle . . . this . . . twat me: i’ll be at my desk then. ws: (grumbles) two hour mark, still no signs of progress decide to head to finance to check my options if i can’t get this form turned in on time me: (to finance employee i don’t know) excuse me miss, are x and x around? i need to ask them a few questions about my timesheet? her: i believe they have already gone home for the day. me: hmmm. do you happen to know the procedure if an intern like me can’t get my timesheet signed and turned in today. her: sure, you can turn one in on monday morning at the latest. me: that’s the problem though. i need the paycheck to go through this weekend so i can pay my bills on time. her: i’m sorry. that’s all i know about it. it’s more x and x’s field. me: (sigh) ok, thanks for the help. two and a half hour mark, go back to my desk walk slowly past ws desk, can see still no signature three hour mark, still nothing me and ws are now the only people left in the office decide to test the waters again me: (walking up to ws desk) any developments with th . . . ws: no! i’m busy! if anything changes i’ll give you the damn form!! eyes go red, i grab nearest blunt object, stapler!, smash smash!, cave his head in, ah hahahah hahaha, it’s glorious! comes back to reality me: ok then. i go back to my desk four hour mark, building mini houses out of post its goingpostalberg is a thriving metropolis catch glimpse of ws walking toward desk oh glorious everything, it’s signed and i’m going home ws: i’m going home (me). x didn’t send anything so i’m not signing this. (tosses paper at me, turns and leaves) expression on my face similar to what i imaging people living about 20 miles away from hiroshima when the bomb went off experienced this bitch is gonna die runs up to ws me: sir, i need this signed so i can pay my bills this weekend! ws: i’m not signing it!!! ws grabs his stuff and leaves in a huff (grinding teeth) walk over and put timesheet on x’s keyboard for monday leave note for him to come talk to me first thing on top of it go home for weekend get some money from parents so i don’t freeze to death in apartment show up to work monday morning tell x and the other managers who gradually gather around what happened can tell by their expression this is going to be sweet x takes ws into meeting room heated words can be heard exchanged even with the door closed hear x say ws needed to apologize to me by the end of the day x comes out first and gives me a nod ws shuffles out and avoids all eye contact, heads back to desk and continues working pretends like nothing happened wait all day, no apology and ws heads home fine, i’ll get you back one day ws i gather my things and head toward the door no.fucking.way. ws has dropped his wallet next to his desk cue evil dave chappelle laugh, i’ll sacrifice a goat to you at the next solstice karma gods i leave quickly with a new addition in my pocket for the next few weeks i don’t say a word ws looks everywhere, asks everyone, he can’t find it has to cancel credit cards/id’s, loses pictures he can’t replace already pretty bad work performance gets even worse three weeks later finally gets fired after making outburst to someone higher up the chain who isn't having it ws walks by my desk to say goodbye, people were acting all teary eyed (give me a break) ws: (me) i’m going now. sorry about the thing. me: (looking confused) umm . . . do you work here? the look on his face delicious to think all you had to do was take three seconds and sign my timesheet ws p.s. thanks for buying the homeless guy in front of my apartment a hundred bucks worth of groceries with your cash tl;dr president clinton comes to my high school and gets caught blowing coke off the back of the toilet in the girls restroom by special needs kidsa couple years ago i was renting a duplex. it was nice enough in a good area of town. not the ideal living situation, but the price was right. my first set of neighbors were awesome. a couple about my age who i shared interests with. even though they watched tv or played video games at all hours, i very rarely heard them. unfortunately, they moved out about four months after i moved in. a couple with a toddler moved in. the loudest toddler known to humankind. this is relevant, because my job did one of those merging and downsizing numbers, and i was one of the employees who got cut. no big deal. i had a large emergency fund and could draw unemployment. luckily, i found a placeholder job shortly after, working overnights. the overnights were even something of an advantage, because i could apply for and interview for jobs in my regular field during the day. the problem was the hellspawn. while i was trying to sleep, the child would scream at the top of its lungs, run stamping around their half of the duplex like a herd of elephants, then scream some more. when the kid watched tv shows, the volume was always jacked to the absolute max. it made sleeping difficult, even with high-quality earplugs or headphones. i tried talking to them. "hey, i work the night shift and so could you please try and keep it down a little". nothing i tried worked, no matter how polite or how firm i was. the neighbors responded "kids will be kids" and "that's apartment living, you just hear your neighbors" - even though i mentioned my former neighbors had been avid movie watchers and i rarely heard them. fine, then. i couldn't sleep? they wouldn't. before i left for my night shift, i the volume on my sound system way up and had [this song]( on constant repeat. five minutes after i got home, the wife of the couple was hammering on my door. she started yelling about how all the noise made it so they couldn't sleep. i responded: "sorry, i guess i must have set my alarm clock for the wrong time. it must be rough when you can't sleep, right?" simple as that, the kid was much quieter. i still heard them, but only occasionally instead of almost constantly. a couple months later i found a day shift job again and all was fine. **tl;dr** neighbors kid was noisy. neighbors wouldn't listen to polite complaints. solved the problem with haddaway. posting this to /r/pettyrevenge *(edit: since removed)* and /r/prorevenge as the revenge was petty, but the setup for it took a bit of effort. it's a long 'un as well. working as a bouncer in a quiet gaming room tonight whilst struggling with my fifth day of being off cigarettes so i'm pretty edgy. a young hipster chick comes up to the bar and asks me; '*what goes with a liquorice liqueur?*' i'm a single malt scotch man, so i'm not too sure. i reply with, 'not sure, when in doubt try soda water i suppose.' she then turns around and orders a pint of the cheapest beer for her equally cheap looking friend, and a *soda water.* at this point i'm thinking to myself, *nah, she can't be that stupid!* well sure enough, her friend with the beer goes to the table whilst soda hipster *(man, i gotta trade mark that, good indie band name)* goes directly to the toilets, returning a minute later with that murky blue soda water / black sambuca combo. how stupid do you think i am girl, really? so, i hover close enough to glean snippets of the conversation they were having; plans of where to go from there, involving going to get refills at the bottle shop and hitting a club, both of which are nearby, and happen to be guarded by good friends of mine in the security industry. i duck into the adjacent smoking room and snap a pic of them, plan forming. i then 'clean up' around their table, when i accidentally (air quotes) bump her drink, sending it flying over her white cloth bag and phone. i immediately apologise, and offer a replacement. part one in action. going to the bar, i pour another soda water. when i put it down in front of her, she genuinely looks puzzled, telling me she ordered a sambuca and soda. to which i reply that she had in fact ordered a soda water, self served her own alcohol into said drink (illegal here to clarify), and that once she finished her soda she could leave the venue as she wouldn't be served anymore. she informed me that she didn't know it was illegal to do that, to which i replied if you didn't think it was, why do it in the toilets so no one could see you? no response, so i walk away, telling the staff what happened. part two involved me sending that pic to the venues the two hipsters (who had been joined by equally hipster bf's) were going to after here with a request to refuse service / entry to soda hipster^tm. around 10 minutes later, she goes to the bar and asks for another soda water. i calmly reiterate that she can't be served anymore, to which she says with a smile 'thanks, you 'ranga cunt!' (non aussies: 'rang-a' = 'ginger') and walks away, obviously happy with this insult. pfft, i get called that and *worse* daily. anyway, i send a follow up text to the venue bouncers asking that when they knock her back, tell her 'courtesy of the ranga cunt.' when her friends try to buy more drinks, i have informed the staff to refuse them, and to say 'courtesy of the ranga cunt' as well, just for a laugh. after a few attempts, soda hipster^tm storms out with her obviously embarrassed friends. as the bottle shop and club are literally on the same block as i with the bottle shop a few stores from the entrance to my venue, i walk outside, texting a third time that the group are leaving my place. i can see the doorman, big dev, down the road at the bottle shop check his phone, then stick his thumb up in the air without looking at the group. the group arrive at the bottle shop and soda hipster^tm is refused service. i can tell when dev said the punch line as he bowed slightly before she spun and stared back in my direction, to see me giving a casual wave. at least her boyfriend found it funny by the look of him. so they disappear around the corner to their second destination, only to return around 5 minutes later, heading towards me, whilst the venue manager and myself are pissing ourselves laughing at soda hipster^tm storming ahead of the pack. she pulls up at my door and angrily demands my name. i inform her that by law i can only give her my security tag number. so she wants to talk to the manager. the vm steps in and says that i had done everything in accordance to the law and that if i said anything to other bouncers to help them in their duties that i was able to do so as its my choice, not his. frustrated, she now wants the manager to get my boss down here. i feign surprised horror at the suggestion, then defeat, telling the vm to grab the company business card from the security register. as he is doing so, soda hipster^tm is standing there with a smug grin and crossed arms, saying things like *you're fucked now, there goes your job* etc while i try my best to look ashamed. the boyfriend is clearly amused by the situation, but also torn between being on his gf's side of the matter as well. been there, done that buddy. the vm returns and gives soda hipster^tm the company business card, to which she pulls out her phone and starts dialing the after hours number. idly, i turn to her boyfriend and ask him if he likes magic tricks. he looks confused. the intro to *murmaider* by dethklok emanates from my pocket. i whip out my phone and theatrically ask the bf; 'is ***this*** her number sir?!?' guess soda hipster^tm didn't realise it was my company, but at least he saw the humour in it. **update:** so now she is sending abusive texts, i'm replying to each one with [this.](back in highschool i used to sell a bit of weed, you know, so i could smoke mine for free and have a little extra pocket change for gas and whatnot. to give you an idea, i'd dime and 8th out an ounce every week, 2 if there was a crazy party that weekend or whatever. i never sold more than a quarter and i didn't even like selling that much because it would fuck with my limited profit margin. anyways, i had met this kid at a party, he went to a school in the city (i was in the burbs) and ended up becoming a fairly regular custy, driving up to grab an 8th once in a while as i had a line on some better than most type herb. one day i get a call from him asking if he can give this chick he knows my number, sure whatever, shit was a little slow and i wanted to re up soon. so i get a call from this chick and she immediately asks if i can get her a qp, "uhh no", i hear some hushed conversation then it's an ounce, still no, a half? no. more whispering and i hear someone getting frustrated in the background, she gets back on and asks what i can give her, i tell her a quarter at most. more whispering and she comes back with a quarter and an 8th, whatever i figure theres more than one person wanting weed and like i said i wanted to re up so i agree, but i'm kind of stoned and it's pouring outside so i tell her she'll have to come to me. fast forward about an hour and she pulls up, i run down my driveway and there she is, a pregnent, trashy looking chick accompanied by one of the hoodest boogers i've ever seen. now i'm not trying to sell bud to a pregnant chick, but i'm figuring it's for og bobby johnson chilling shotgun. i go to her window and she confirms that it's for him by signaling me to go around the car to deal with him, which should have been a redflag, but i wasn't thinking. i go over to parlay with him (the car already reeks of weed) and make the rookie mistake of handing him the product first, he looks at it and starts sighing up a storm. he asks me "how much again?" "80 dude" "ahhh i can't pay 80 for this", we make eye contact and i realize what's up. i try to grab the weed but he smacks my hand off it and she peels off, almost taking my arm with her. now my adrenaline starts going because my arm hit the window frame pretty hard and i'm just pissed in general so i start frantically looking around for something to throw, anything to get them somehow. then i see my car in the driveway, and then i remember my keys are in my jacket, so i hop right the fuck in and start pursuit. at this point i'm starting to think clearly again and i begin to wonder what the fuck can i actually do here. i can't ram them off the road and i'm assuming they are heading to bad area where he most certainly would have plenty of back up waiting as it's clear i'm following them, plus dude was kind of big as it is. then it hits me: pregnant chick, ghetto trashbag, the mutiple bags of weed they just stole (i was at the end of my selling supply after the quarter and i had 3 grams prebagged which i just threw in a bag with 7.5, so they had seperate bags of weed). i whip out my phone and call the cops, tell them i saw some dude with a pregnant girl selling weed to a kid in my neighborhood and i was following them because i was sick of the shit, you know, bullshitting. i stay on the phone and tell them exactly where we are and as soon as we turned onto the main road they get pulled the fuck over. i drove on a little ways ahead so i wouldn't be dragged into it and then busted a u. when i passed them like 10 minutes later, they had the girl and the dick sperated, girls in the car, dicks standing in the rain at the end of the cop car stressing, and the one of cops was starting a search of their car... where he was sure to find a bag filled with weed and 3 other smaller bags of weed, possession with intent to motherfucking sell! can't help that there was a pregnant chick involved either. i went home, called my buddy over, and partook in a blaze of glory. good times. sucks about my 10.5 though. tl;dr: preggo broad and thug robbed my herb, so i follow them and got them arrested. edit: formatted for enhanced readability, thanks for the suggestion /u/acoz0rtl;dr dipshit breaks my friends windshield. can't punch like a man. i am russell crowe. titties. so i am a bouncer. proof: username. pro revenge is probably my favorite subreddit, so i contribute when i can. so a few weeks ago there was a small get together at one of my friends apartments. we were drinking, goofing around, having a good time. well around 2 a.m. we hear a bunch of glass being broken. we look out the third story window and see three guys sprinting away from the parking lot. i think i recognize one of them but i've had a few, so whatever. we look over to my buddy's truck, and his windshield is smashed to hell. it's barely even in the truck anymore. we call the police and they say they'll look into it, but probably won't be able to do much since there were no cameras and we had been drinking. goddamn small town cops. my buddy is pissed and i tell him i'll ask around and see what i can find out. people talk at the bar. fast forward to a night at work a few days later and i'm talking to one of my co workers about what happened. he said "i'm pretty sure i know who did it." "who?" "it was one of my fraternity brothers. he's a complete dickhead and i'm pretty sure he was bragging about it the other day at meeting." "would you be willing to tell the police?" "nah, probably not. i hate the mother fucker, but he's still in my fraternity. he hazes way too hard though, so you can fuck him up if you want to . he could use a good ass whooping." "i've got a better idea." he identified the guy as someone we'll call s. for small penis. well s is a frequenter at the bar, considering it's the only one in town that all the greeks go to. so i started doing something every time s walked into the bar. he's only 20, so every time he would get someone to get him a drink, i would rip it out of his hands and kick him out. normally we just take the drinks from guys and give them a warning with three strikes. well i would do this every. single. time he came to the bar. it was a $10 cover too. he would pay, come in, get a drink, and then i would kick him out. under 10 minutes every time. well after about a dozen times he was really drunk one night and got pissed and got up all in my face. i thought to myself "he put on his big boy britches tonight." he starts screaming "fuck you asshole! i don't have any fun at the bar anymore! you never do this to anyone else!" stuff like that. "sir, i do this everyone. now leave the bar." as i start to escort him off the dance floor. out of nowhere he turns around and jaws me as hard as he can. standard procedure is that when a fight breaks out, we cut the music and turn on the lights so the other bouncers can have better visibility. our dj was on point that night. as soon as i got hit, he cut the music immediately. i just stopped and stood there, looking at him. the lights were on, the music was stopped, and a circle had begun to form around us. i smiled and said "you hit like a fucking bitch." his face went from hardass to pussy in .5 seconds. i told him to hit me again. he swung and i put my head down so he nailed me right in the forehead. he yelled in pain and grabbed his hand. point of information, i'm a really big guy. i was an offensive lineman for a division 1 school in college, and i was a national champion powerlifter in high school and college. i know how to take a hit. "you punch like a fucking pussy. i haven't even hit you and i'm winning this fight. try again you fucking bitch." at this point he tried to tackle me to the ground. i took one step back and just stood there as he put all his weight against me. i threw him to the ground after a few seconds. this was a lot easier than i thought it would be. people were beginning to laugh at him for his bitchy attempts to hit me. i couldn't resist. i turned to the crowd and yelled "are you not entertained!?" i picked him up off the ground and said "you are permanently banned from &lt;name of the bar&gt;. if you ever come back here, i'll hit you harder than you hit my friend's windshield." and with that i threw him out for the last time. the only other bouncer on the floor was the guy who told me that s needed an ass whooping. he was laughing his titties off the whole time. from what my coworker told me, s broke his hand on my skull and had to wear a cast for a few months. so it cost him over $100 to get thrown out of the bar before that night and i imagine several hundred more to get his hand fixed. not only that, but every single frat guy and sorority girl knows how big of a bitch he is. so that cut his chances of getting laid down to nothing, and his ability to shit talk at intramural games down to nothing as well. my friend who got his windshield broken said insurance took care of everything, and this was fantastic. that's what you get for being a dickhead. i worked for a software company as a qa test lead. the company really liked me and i went from a general assistant to a test lead and tripled my pay in the space of the first 2 and a half years i was there. i have a strong work ethic and my opinion held a lot of weight 4 years in when i was leaving to pursue other ventures. my last manager there, who we called 'half day hambly' (not his real last name, but similar) because he had a habit of disappearing after lunch on thursdays and fridays. none of us minded too much since when he was there he liked to 'shoulder surf' and micromanage projects where he knew absolutely nothing and generally made an ass of himself. he was known for forcing projects off track and then blaming the platform programmers for the stall; he had no problems tossing people under the bus to give the appearance that he was competent. right before i left, i had to have minor outpatient surgery and i stopped by his office to let him know that i would need to work from home for a few days afterward, which was a routine occurrence in my department and i had done it on a couple of occasions. he agreed and i went about my business until he informed me after i put in 30 hours from home while recovering that i would need to use comp time to cover my missed hours. i went to him and reminded him of the fact that he ok'd it and he gave me a 'fuck you' smile and said 'well, i guess you should have put it in an email.' so, the following week, when i did my exit interview with hr on my last day i unloaded on them and told them all about halfday hambly's adventures in mismanagement and how he regularly skipped out after lunch to go play golf on thursdays and fridays. the hr manager i spoke with tried calling his office to bring him down right then but got no answer. he asked me if i'd go by his office and bring him down but when i went up, i found his office locked and no one answered the door. the look on the hr managers face was priceless when i told him this as it was 1:30pm on friday when this happened. the hr manager had my check adjusted for me, wished me luck and i left with a smile on my face knowing i had outed this asshole. 2 weeks later, my good friend and coworker called me up to say 'guess who they just fired!' hr started watching old 'halfday' after i left and determined his caliber of excellence would serve him best somewhere else.i had posted the story of my divorce here a little while back, [here]( is the story. well...onto the fun part. &amp;nbsp; just 2 days ago, i was at my local wal-mart, picking up dog food (for my dogs) and collard greens (for my bearded dragon). i had been having a strange feeling the entire time, like an itch in the middle of my back that i couldn't quite reach to scratch. it had started about 3 minutes after i had gotten into the store, and had been persistent the entire time, only ever going away one time, when i had stepped into the bathroom. &amp;nbsp; i came back out of the bathroom, grabbed my cart, and out of habit and reflex, did a quick 360 scan of the area by the bathrooms. unfortunately, i saw something i had no desire to see. 4 registers down, trying to hide behind a rack of postcards (and failing miserably, due to the fully exposed, *very* familar african-american child in the cart)....was **thundercunt**. &amp;nbsp; from what i could see, she was on the phone, and not happy with the conversation she was having. she would keep looking at me (i had my phone out and was pretending to text, while looking at her out of the corner of my eye), and would get even more agitated. &amp;nbsp; so, since i was pretty much done with shopping, i wheeled my cart into the nearest cash register, laid my items on the belt (not the dog food, i was gonna let them come with a hand scanner to scan that 50 pound bastard of a bag), and smoothly, deliberately scanned over and *stared directly at her*. &amp;nbsp; well, this apparently set her off, because as soon as she saw me doing so, she blew up on the phone, seemed to be practically yelling into it. i calmly finished paying for my items, put the bags into my cart, and headed for the entrance. thundercunt, however, had other plans... &amp;nbsp; she promptly pushed her cart out of her ineffective hiding spot, took a second to see which way i had gone, and took off after me. she almost threw her cart in front of me, trying to get me to stop, and proceeded to give me the dirtiest look i had ever seen from her (and that's saying something), and then said something i still have yet to wrap my mind around. &amp;nbsp; **"i want my divorce!"** &amp;nbsp; now, i had to stop and take a second to try to process that particular statement, as to my knowledge, we had gone through our divorce hearing several months prior. so, after thinking it over, and discarding the statement as being the raving of a person who already lost the argument but refuses to let it go, i maneuvered my cart around hers, took a second to smile at her child (hell, i had nothing against the baby, and all jokes aside, she was adorable), and began walking out the door. thundercunt responded with "oh, you're just going to ignore me? i want my divorce, you bitch!" &amp;nbsp; well, i just kept walking. on my way out, a rather burly guy, of the "t-shirt with the sleeves cut off" variety, rushed past me, right up to tc. they exchanged a brief flurry of conversation, littered with her pointing at me and then at him, ending with her throwing her hands up and walking away with her cart. he looked at me, i smiled a bit and gave them both the one-finger salute, and loaded my stuff in my truck and left. &amp;nbsp; honestly, the only thing i can assume from the situation is that he was either (a): a new boyfriend, or (b): a family member that i wasn't familiar with (hell, might have been both, who knows), that she had enlisted the help of to either intimidate me into giving her more, or to rough me up. it would make sense, with her spouting off a statement that had been invalidated months beforehand. either way, whatever she was attempting failed miserably when i applied the tried and true method of "ignore the idiots and move on." **tl;dr:** thundercunt comes back for round 2, gets shut down just as hard as before. i used to work at a busy local pizza "restaurant" as a pizza cutter for $10 p/h cash in hand. so my job involved cutting pizzas and sorting out the orders, not very hard unless there is twenty coming out of the oven in a minute... anyhow, i won't lie i would make a couple of mistakes here and then with orders. as you would expect you would a stern talking to by the boss after each one. however after a while the mistakes started becoming more and more frequent to the stage where i was getting screamed at, i was now triple checking orders because i was sure i had them right. one night "i" was up to eight mistaken orders; then i turn around and catch the mother fucker mixing up my orders that i had organised and then walking off. i was fucking furious! i was copping all this shit because this cunt bag was making mistakes... so after that night i fucking handed it to him. i told him what i thought about him and his shitty restaurant. there were no safety or health standards enforced with the meals or anywhere in the kitchen tbh. so here is what i do... turns out a lot of my friends ordered from the store so of course i tell them how there food is prepared and how there is no respect for the employees. by word of mouth one of the people still working there tells me their nights gradually began getting quieter. then i thought to myself "how else can i fuck-over this cunt bag?" then i remembered that he used to make around $3500 - $4500 after "wages" every night. so i did some math and established if he had been cutting corners by keeping people off the books then he owed a shit load of tax and super to everyone that worked there. so i made a phone call to the tax office and it turns out he owed them upwards of $2,000,000 au provided he had been paying cash in hand for the past eight years the business had been running. i'll just say... there is no more local pizza shop. i believe the tax evasion also landed him some jail time so serves the cunt right. tldr; boss was an asshole, i made him lose his business and had him sent to jail.when my mom was 19 yrs old she was raped in her small town in germany, she got pregnant as a result and aborted the baby. she never reported the crime cause she was ashamed and felt like it was her fault. many years later i'm in her home town, when a man approaches the table we are at with myself, my mom, and my dad he asks how my mom is doing. my dad got really pissed off that he would come near us, and i later found out that man was the person who raped my mom. life goes on a year passes i'm visiting my grandma (in the home town) at the bar having a beer. the man who raped my mother walks in, i know what he did and he knows who i am. i ignore him, the conversation in the bar turns to a sexual one. the man points at me and says "your mom had the best pussy" without thinking i grabbed the bottle of vodka (the bar tender kept his bottles near the edge of the bar) and wacked him across the head with the bottle as hard as i could, the bar tender grabbed me and said "what are you doing?" i yelled back "he is the guy who raped my mother" (bar tender was familiar with the story, didn't know who did it, but knew the person still lived in the same town) bar tender let me go, i jump on top of him and start punching him. he was dazed by being smacked in the head with a hard vodka bottle and didn't really have it in him to resist. finally a customer come over to me and pulled me off. i was able to get a few kicks into his ribs/stomach and i was pulled away and put in the corner. man came back up, ran towards me to avenge his injustice when the same customer who break us up stopped his advance, the man yelled at the bar tender to call the cops. the bar tender said "get out of my bar and never come back" the man hobbled away no cops where ever called tl:dr beat up the man who raped my mother for making a comment about her vagina. * later my mom found out about it, she told my dad he needs to tell me not to do that. my dad smiled and said like father like son. apparently he took once beat the shit out of this man for raping my mom. i posted this to /r/pettyrevenge but have received encouragement to post it here as well. this is going to be long, but i've been dying to tell this story. it's about how i put a narcissistic woman in her place after being accused of stealing on facebook. a few years ago, i was involved in one of those "swap and sell" groups on facebook. it was specifically for stay-at-home moms, and mostly centered around trading and selling clothing, toys, etc. it was an awesome resource, because you could get things for your children at a very low price, and often make new friends in the process. there was one woman, however, that made the swap and sell group an unpleasant place. we'll call her kathy. in person, all she ever talked about was herself, specifically about how great she was. she did the same for her kids. she would also slip little hints in about how you or your children were inferior in some way. for example, she would say things like "oh, your child's soccer team came in third place last season? my son's team came first, but that's not very surprising considering how good he is. i must have done a great job raising him and it's a shame that others can't do the same with their children." she really would say things like that. in hindsight, she was a narcissist. i'm not just saying that, i'm pretty sure she could be diagnosed. i just did the best i could to avoid her if i saw her in the next aisle of a store. one day she saw me with my infant son. he was crying, so she came over and said, "oh, let me hold him. i can get him to calm down." it was infuriating. almost everyone hated her. but kathy really took it to the next level when it came to the swap and sell. she would be the first in line to buy something, only to demand a lower price upon inspection. "these clothes look dirtier than what i saw in the picture, i will only pay half!" she did this crap all the time, and if the seller didn't oblige, she posted a rant about how they screwed her over, never do business with them, yada yada. this sort of talk was technically against the rules of the swap and sell, but kathy was friends with the administrator, so nothing was ever done. the administrator was lazy anyway and rarely interacted with the group. furthermore, kathy had a few cronies that would send pms to everyone in the group, bad-mouthing sellers who didn't accpet kathy's half price crap. it was borderline blackmail. i always felt some anxiety when i posted something for sale, because i was afraid kathy would claim it first and then pull her scam. which she did, several times. she had facebook hooked up to her phone, and since she sat at home and did nothing all day, she was fast to jump on items for sale. oftentimes she would buy something, and then it would appear for sale months later at a jacked up price. what made this all the more frustrating was the fact that she was a pastor's wife and had good standing in the community. nobody knew what a bitch she was, even though she was a toxic and selfish person who cared only about herself. i put up with this woman for three years. then, one day, i had had enough... i listed a toy for sale. it needed 2 aa batteries to work. knowing this, i purchased a new pack of batteries and put them in the toy. i tested it. it worked. i said that batteries were included in my listing. everything seemed to be in order. within two minutes, kathy jumped in and said she wanted it. she obviously saw it pop up on her phone while she was lounging around at home. the rules said i had to offer it, because it was "first come first serve" and i could not skip over buyers. so, with a heavy heart, i set up a time to bring it to kathy's house (she refused to meet me halfway or come to my home, as was her custom). i dropped off the toy when i was in town running errands the next day. kathy didn't try to pull the usual "it looks dirtier than the pic" scam, so that was nice. she asked if the batteries were included and i said yes. i received payment and went about my day. kathy was playing fair. bout damn time... but when i got home, i had 20+ notifications on facebook. kathy had tagged me in a post. uh oh, this couldn't be good... in her post, she claimed that there were no batteries. she posted a pic of the empty battery slots, shamed me for my shady sales tactics, gave a little sob story about how her chubby 13-year old soccer star was upset that he couldn't play with it, and demanded her money back. on top of this shitstorm, one of my friends pm'ed me saying that people were receiving messages from kathy's cronies about how selfish and shady i was. that bitch. i had never been more pissed and hurt in my life. i was done putting up with this chick's shit. i responded with a rather lengthy message calling her out on her scams in the past. i said she was a liar for removing the batteries, and that she should be ashamed of herself for behaving in such a manner when she was a pastor's wife. many people liked my comment, and i knew that the shit was about to hit the fan, but i didn't care anymore. when i logged in to facebook the next day, i had a ton of notifications and messages. my stomach dropped. i skimmed through the messages first. some were positive, thanking me for calling kathy out. some were negative, from kathy's cronies, about what a rude person i was to say those things about her. as for the notifications, most of them stemmed from a single post that had been *stickied by the administrator* in the swap and sell group. apparently she overcame her laziness just long enough to publicly humiliate me. the post said that thieves-- yes, thieves-- were not tolerated in the group, and then went on to **mention me by name.** this was no small thing, as there were many women involved in this group, and we were in a small midwestern town where word traveled fast. my reputation as a mother was being attacked. the post went on to say that, rather than banning me, i had the opportunity to apologize and refund the money i owed. the first comment to the post was from kathy. she said something that, no doubt, she had been dying to say for a long time. it went something like this: "sk5872, you've stolen money from me and tried to blame your past actions on me as well. and yet, in the face of your accusations, i have been patient and kind. this peace comes from the lord. if you would only accept him as your savior, you would feel the same peace. if nothing else, this whole situation just proves that i am better than you." over twenty people liked the comment. holy fuck. this shit had to stop. kathy the narcissist was turning the tables and accusing me of actions which were actually hers (an actual case of projection?). the time for vengeance had come. **the revenge** this requires a bit of explaining. you see, kathy had a secret, one that i stumbled on by accident several years prior while reading the local newspaper while doing errands in the next town over. in one small corner regarding court happenings, there was a column about a man who had killed his friend while high on bath salts. i don't remember the exact details of the crime, nor did i know what the nature of the court proceedings were. but thanks to the column, i did know that this man had been found mentally unfit to stand trial and sent to the state mental hospital, and i did know the names of his parents, who were present at the hearing. the parents, strangely enough, had the exact same names as kathy and her husband. i did some googling and discovered that this man was kathy's oldest son. kathy never mentioned having another son, for obvious reasons. this crime happened when kathy and her family were living in this other town. soon after her son was sent to the mental ward, kathy and her husband moved away, to my town. i knew that she had lived elsewhere before joining the swap and sell, but i didn't know that she had moved to distance herself and her husband from their dark secret. this was my short and sweet response to kathy's comment, i still remember it word for word: "kathy, you've asked me to apologize for actions that were yours, and then have the audacity to say that you're better than me. but what's funny, kathy, is that the son you raised turned out to be a lunatic murderer. i will always be better than you." and i posted a link to the old news article. i did not stick around to watch everything go down, as i was sick of the drama. i removed myself from the group and went about my day. **the aftermath** i received a phone call from a close friend in the evening, and i learned what had happened. after i posted the link to the article about kathy's son, the comments section absolutely blew up. kathy and her cronies posted several comments where the group administrator was tagged, demanding that my comment be deleted. my friend said that there were several posts like this and they started to sound pretty desperate near the end. the lazy administrator, of course, was slow to respond. kathy even said something about driving to the administrator's house since she was not returning her phone calls. after a couple of hours, the whole swap and sell group was deleted. but the damage was done. as for what happened to kathy, i never had the chance to find out, as she deleted her facebook. i saw her in the grocery store a few weeks later, but she just flipped me off and walked the other way. my friends and i founded a new swap and sell group. it gets bigger every day, but kathy is not a part of it.first post, long time lurker here, but i believe you guys would like this story. this is not my story but of a good friend of mine (let's call him mitch) whom i've known for many many years now. this happened 15 years ago when mitch and i were both 16 yo. mitch has two younger brothers, at the time 14 and 15 yo. mitch and his brothers had the most beautiful golden lab, always friendly, a bit lazy as labs can be, loved everybody, truly a great dog. the neighbor though hated the dog, something about its fur getting in his lawn when it shed (i live in a warm mediterranean country so dogs tend to shed a lot here), something about it barking during siesta, in any case, the neighbor was being a bitch about it. now, mitch's parents are of the quiet type, trying to accommodate, they even put a fence inside their own yard to keep the dog in the other side of the yard, facing the property of the other neighbor that had no issues with their dog, kept the dog inside during siestas, and mitch and his brothers would brush the undercoat regularly during the summer months to limit any shedding. to make a long story short, one day they come back home after a day trip and they find the dog convulsing and foaming in their yard, dying soon after. they immediately knew what happened as the telltale signs of a poisoned dog were all too familiar to the father as he had witnessed it time and time again in his youth, when the local police would poison stray dogs during the 50s and 60s to contain an outbreak of rabies. mitch and his brothers were inconsolable. their parents confronted the neighbor, who without admitting guilt, said something along the lines 'the dog had it coming'. the parents, for reasons unknown, probably to avoid any prolonged legal battle or to just put an end to the story, decided not to press charges; which 'forced' mitch and his brothers to take the 'appropriate' action they believed the neighbor deserved. i am not saying that i condone what they did, but let's say that as a dog lover it still brings a smile to my face 15 years later. they waited patiently for 3 days after the event, when the neighbor and his wife (their children had moved out a few years prior) went out for the night. small parenthesis, all 3 were and still are some of the kindest and most thoughtful boys/men that i know. but i regress, they waited for the neighbors to go out for the night, and that's when they broke into the house and started to systematically destroy everything the neighbors owned. electronics, furniture, drapes, carpets, bedlinen, everything. they spent a good one hour in the neighbors house, wreaking havoc. he later told me that it was very meticulous and systematic. they all 3 were crying, and just moving on to the next object to break, or shear, or tear. they then sat outside the porch and waited. sometime later the neighbor comes back home, and they just stare at him and smile, waiving to him as he enters his house with his wife. he never pressed charges either. mitch's parents now have 3 golden labs in the yard, and have always had dogs since then. as far as i know, they never really had issues with the neighbor either.when i was younger, my favorite fruit was strawberries. i could eat pounds and pounds of it and not get sick. unfortunately, it is also my mother's favorite fruit. every time we would buy some, she would tell me to only eat half since the other half was hers. of course, being six years old and home alone does not give me good impulse control. so i ate all of the box. my mother whooped my butt and sent me to bed without dinner. i thought that was the end of it. my mother, on the other hand, decided that she was sick of me eating all the strawberries in the house. she decided that she was going to stop me from eating them once and for all. so she decided to change the detergent and do all of my laundry. now, i have very sensitive skin and i am allergic to a lot of things, including fragrances. i break out into hives when i deal with an allergen. so she changed the detergent to a very abrasive one to get back at me. the next day i broke out in hives at school and fainted. mom wasn't done then. she took me to the doctor (for a blood test since we were still trying to figure out if i was diabetic) and told me that the doctors think i am allergic to strawberries. this was devastating. i was told that it could have been worse, that i could have died from eating even a little bit. it has been 14 years since i have had a single bite of a strawberry. i barely remember what they taste like. however, i found out all about this at a family party when introducing my boyfriend. i told him about how i can't have strawberries for dessert. my mom walks up, looks at me funny, "of course you can. you're not allergic." the second i reminded her, she began to laugh. "oh you were never allergic." i found out the rest from my dad. thanks mom. i hate you too. tl;dr: don't fuck with my mom. edit: i did not expect this to blow up as bad as it did. glad you guys thought it was an entertaining story. for those who were wanting it to be about me getting revenge, see rule 2. now to answer the most frequent issues since you guys are starting to scare me. my mom is not an abuser. she is a little mentally unhinged, but she does her best with what she has. she thought this was the best way to teach me a lesson, and it did. it was not the best way to go about it however. i fainted not because of the hives, but because i had forgotten to eat my snack according to my dad. i was diagnosed with type two diabetes when i hit that age. second, we were a poor family who couldn't afford child care. my cousins lived the apartments above us and my mother worked at the grocery store that was a five minute walk even when i was six. she was our only provider due to my dad's dickishness. when we finally moved for her new job, we got child care, but i was too old for that by then. the big deal was that i was taking away all the treats in our house for myself. that's why my mother was upset. we rarely got anything sweet, let alone fresh fruit. hence, why i went crazy. yes, my dad knew. i have no idea why he didn't tell me. it's over and done now for me. i thought it was a little funny, but it confirmed my ideas about putting them both in a nursing home.i needed a place to stay and did not have much of a choice in the matter. the price and location were right so i had to rent from this slumlord. **the landlord** he is a self proclaimed "handy man". he drove a gutted out shitball of a van filled with cheeseburger wrappers and junk. acted less than interested in any of my problems as a tenant (i went through 3 fridges (used ones, not new of course), hundreds in groceries, lost a bunch of clothing and furniture when the house flooded twice in one week, there was a faint but constant smell of natural gas, the furnace only worked when you lit the pilot light (which you had to do every time you wanted heat in the winter), and half a fucking tree that landed on the roof during a storm, but was never removed). **me** minnesotan (tend to be too god damn nice at times), always always always pay my rent on time, took care of all of the utilities and general upkeep (mowed, shoveled snow, cleaned the lawn, etc etc) of the property during my tenancy. *good tenant* i have too many stories about this cat, but i'll get to the revenge part of this. i had finally had enough and i had decided to move out of this slum. i had lost thousands in my own money to use on the upkeep of the property (since the landlord had no intention on helping me ever). i had found a new place and had told my landlord the news when i handed him a check for a month and a half and told him that i would be moving out in a set number of days. we agreed and it seemed to go quite well. this is when all of the shit really started running downhill. he showed up in my apartment one day, unannounced, and was looking for something. to this day, i don't know what, but i confronted him and he ran out of my apartment like he had been just caught snooping in a woman's panty drawer. then when i am at work he starts leaving me this really creepy messages, saying i didn't pay him rent and that i have been destroying the property. i brush it off, take a few days off of work, and move out of my place after i call my new landlord explaining my dilemma. my new landlord agrees to let me move in early free of charge, awesome. i move out and get a couple of friends to help me deep clean the place (its amazing what you can buy with a case of beer and some pizza). we clean the place and its spotless. after we finish, i get this weird feeling and i take pictures. tons and tons of pictures of every room. feeling content, we pack up the rest, lock the doors and leave. we had a good night and i bought pizza and beer for my friends that came out to help. a couple days go by and slumlord larry calls and asks where i went. i explained that i really wanted to move and i worked out a situation with my new landlord that would allow me to move in early. he started shouting at me on the phone, going off about how i still owe him money and i couldn't terminate my lease (which there was no such thing by the way, just a verbal agreement and the exchange of money.). i had enough of his business and i hung up. a month goes by, i hear nothing from the slumlord. then, all of a sudden, i get a certified letter from him in the mail along with some pictures (how in the fuck did he get my new address, i think to myself). i open the letter and dude is going to try and fucking sue me. stating that i damaged his property (with supposed pictorial evidence) and for the neat sum of $5,000 dollars it would all go away and we would not need to take it to court. i say fuck this and i call up my parents to get the number for their lawyer. i explain everything to him and tell him about the pictures i saved. i ask my lawyer if there is anything that i could do about this. i'm steaming and i want blood. my lawyer laughed it off and told me to go check and see if the property was listed under a rental property in the city that i lived in. the next day i go down to the government center and i find out that the slumlord does not have it listed as anything other than residential. i turn him in and i also find out that the property cannot be rented and a permit for someone to even come look at the property to make sure it was up to code (in the county i lived in) was $5,000. jubilant would not even begin to describe my mood at this time. i was "white guy" celebrating the bitch out of the lobby. i call my lawyer as i am leaving the government center and tell him the good news. as i am leaving town i decide to drive past my place and see if anyone is living there. as i pass, i can't believe my fucking eyeballs. i see the slumlord and a buddy of his "toothless dave" outside the house destroying the siding. i also see that they had fucked up every exterior part of the house to try and pin their misdeeds on me. months go by, i hear nothing, my lawyer hears nothing (despite multiple tries to contact slumlord. at this point, i am filled with an overwhelming sense of joy as i stuck it to that loser. **but wait, there's more!!!** i was telling this story to a buddy of mine at work one day and he knew exactly what house i was talking about. his dad is the county building inspector and he was telling me about how is dad had stated that the property was so damaged that the house was to be condemned. all i'm left thinking about is what did he do to that fucking place to condemn it after i moved out. **tl,dr**; slumlord didn't do shit for me and i lost out on a ton of money. got him back by finding out the property was not listed as a rental property. house ended up getting condemned.i never believed in karma. until this story. a couple of years back i was in a relationship with a wonderful girl. we had been together for 5 years at that point, living together for 2 of them. about a year and a half after we moved in together, i lost my job. it hit me hard to say the least and i became kinda depressed. i guess my girlfriend though comforting me and helping me out was too much because she began sleeping with her co-worker. i saw their e-mail exchange and i lost it. i wanted to confront her so bad but i knew that would do nothing. so i decided to get some revenge. because i wasn't on the lease when we got the apartment (i had shitty credit), i could move out no problem. one morning i arranged some movers to come by our apartment and moved out. but before i did that, i logged into her e-mail and forwarded the exchange between her and the co-worker to the head of hr. later that day i got a text saying that her company let her go, that they were cutting back on staff. i simply texted her "i know you've been cheating on me with earl (not his real name). i moved out this morning. never talk to me again." 2 days later she shows up at my mom's house asking where i am. my mom plays dumb and says she has no clue. she relentlessly texted me after i moved out. and continued to do so for a while. last i heard she moved in with her sister, suffers from depression and is an alcoholic. i guess i'm a bad person because that brought a smile on my face. edit: forgot to add that the guy she was cheating on me with got fired as well.background: i'm a real estate developer and investor, and i own/manage several mid-size multi-family rental properties. i'm aggressive with rents, but i love the construction side of the business and take great pride in keeping my properties in excellent condition. i also ensure my staff provides top notch customer service - i never understood why property managers don't have the same attitude towards customer service as hoteliers. anyways... one of my friends lives in a building owned by a very "traditional" landlord. a grumpy old lady bangs on the door to collect rent every month, things don't get fixed unless you threaten to file a dispute, and in general everything is fixed as cheaply as possible. my friend called me last week and said her fire alarm has been going off since 3am. not the fire alarm actually, but the warning tone on the annunciator panel - this is the device that receives inputs from heat detectors, smoke detectors etc all around the building and monitors and provides power and battery backup. this panel was apparently detecting a fault, and sounding the warning tone. this isn't the fire alarm, but it sounds like a loud smoke detector going off. it cannot be silenced until it is serviced. in my buildings, they occasionally do go off (every few years) and, as with everything else, my staff must attend within 1/2 hour and in this case, appropriate action would be to call the fire safety contractor for an emergency service call. my friend's landlord informed her that the contractor had been called, but it was not an emergency so they would be there in 4 days. *4 days of this alarm going off 24/7 constantly* no sleep for anyone. this was likely to avoid the overtime surcharge for an emergency service. or about $150. but, the manager was kind enough to wrap the panel in several towels with packing tape, to slightly muffle the alarm. he made a half-hearted attempt to silence it by pulling the leads off the backup battery. since the device is hard-wired, this just doubled the frequency of the alarm to include a "backup battery warning." i grabbed by panel keys, and went over to see if i could help my friend out. i was able to open the panel, since i have keys for my own, and they are the same. the battery leads had been pulled off, but the main was still connected, so the beeper was going off like crazy. the manager didn't know enough to turn off the breaker in the electrical room, and i couldn't access it. the manager didn't answer the phone. upon opening the panel, i saw immediately why it had been failing on and off for years (according to my friend) - the batteries were 10 years out of date, and the leads on the terminals were blackened. it looked like the landlord had been swapping out the old batteries with new ones for the yearly inspection, then putting the old ones back in and maybe returning the new batteries for a refund. now i realized why the service call was scheduled so late - so the ll could get some temporary "new" batteries put in time. now, i'm a licensed property manager, but not an electrician, so it would be unethical for me to remove the hot lead from the bus bar and silence the alarm, but low voltage wiring is a different story. unfortunately my insulated screwdriver slipped as i was tightening the battery lead back on, and i accidentally bridged the hot side of the bus bar with the low voltage side of the circuit board. luckily, my eyes were averted to avoid arcing injury. 120v right to the control board. ouch. a big flash, breaker tripped somewhere, and silence. the circuit board was toast - the service tech would have to install a new panel with new batteries. my friend contacted the landlord and reported that something had happened, and the panel was silenced. also, did he intend to provide a 24 hour firewatch until such time as the fire alarm system is fully functional as required by section 6 of the fire code? he affirmed that he did not, and that she could fuck off. her next call was to the assistant chief fire inspector, since she happened to have his business card handy. his response was much more gracious - he was happy to provide the necessary firewatch, and contacted the landlord to inform him of the fact. the fireman's union is a strong one, and their hourly rate for emergency services like this are comparable to a mid-town manhattan law firm. i'm told the bill reached $3000 before the landlord called the service tech to replace the annunciator panel. i'd like to say he also paid the $5,000 fine, but i understand he is fighting that in court. in the meantime, the building sleeps peacefully with a fully functional and up to date fire alarm. just thought i would share a story related to me by my grandfather. back in 'the war' my grandpa was in the navy. he was a fairly skinny guy, but obscenely tough. being of italian heritage, he received 'more than his fair share of shit' from his shipmates. being as italy was not exactly on the best of terms with the us back in wwii, i can only imagine the corn-fed 'muricans on his ship were pretty much dick to him. he could have easily brawled and come out on top, but that wasn't his style. he was a gentleman, and (apparently) always gave people the benefit of the doubt and allowed opportunities to change their own minds. one job of his on ship was packing (and re-packing, i assume) parachutes. quick sidebar here: when you were going to be jumping out of a plane, be it for a combat mission or training, you used the chute you are issued. no exceptions. none. you are given a parachute and that's what you used. anywho... my grandpa would occasionally play with the chutes of people who made his life hell. not that they were in any way unsafe, just playing with people's heads. what he would do is leave a few scraps of tattered parachute cloth or suspension cord hanging out of the packed chute. when he was issuing the chutes to the dickheads, and someone noticed stuff sticking out, he would just go 'ok, no problem and cut off the offending material and hand it back to the guy (he cut off the junk he had added, the chutes were still perfectly packed). these assholes would have to spend the next few hours _knowing_ that heir chutes had been tampered with and that they were jumping to their deaths (obviously they werent, but the didn't know it until they pulled the cord and their chute worked perfectly). people stopped being dicks to him and just left him alone after he taught a few people their lesson. my grandpa is a smart old guy.been enjoying this subreddit, and thought i'd post my own story here. while not as epic as some of these or as clever as nobody ended up in jail or out thousands of dollars, for me it was a pretty important victory. regarding the survival mode thing - years ago i was living with a couple of friends and lost both my job and my place to live within the same 24 hours when the economy shit itself and the bank foreclosed on the owner where we were staying. had about two weeks to get out, and i ended up homeless and living in my car for two years. that's another story entirely. the point, however, is when living in a large city in a vehicle, your survival mode kicks in constantly. you're always worried, you're always cautious, and in the event something happens that's a threat, you usually think of the most effective, brutal, and quickest way to remove it as a threat. as a result, even years later now that i'm stable, i don't really have the ability to gauge an appropriate response to a threat. maybe that's why i went overboard here, but i'll share the story and let others be amused or pass judgement as the case may be. when i was living in my car, i developed a relationship with someone who was a bit more stable than i was. she didn't really care that i lived in a car, as i was always presentable and was able to hold down temp work - nobody really knew i lived in a car unless i shared that info with them. she was big on helping people and was genuinely a good person, as i thought at the time. we had a falling out and just gradually lost contact. our relationship was more of a passion thing. we remained friends on facebook, and she was fairly popular on there with about five hundred friends. this is important later. about a year after the two of us broke up and about six months after i had last spoken to her outside of a few casual comments and "likes" i was doing much better. i had just started a new job that i was about to go through training for, and afterwards would be out of the car and into a more permanent residence. i had done a lot to work towards that point, and things were great. i was at a kinkos using their internet on my laptop and my phone rang. it was her. after a very brief exchange of pleasantries, she gets to the point - her current boyfriend got her pregnant and left her. she needed someone to take her to the abortion clinic, and since she was poster-child perfect girl to her circle of friends and family, she couldn't ask any of them to do it. so she was asking me. on one hand, i was perturbed that this was the first time we had spoken in a long time and this was the only subject she felt was important enough to call me on. on the other, i try to be a good guy and even though it backfires, i was raised that way. but in this situation, i really couldn't help her because i was supposed to drop my car off at a friends house the next day then hop a bus to another state for my orientation and new job. even if i wanted to, which i really didn't, i couldn't. i told her as much, and then shit hit the fan. she started screaming at me on the phone, acting hysterical, crying, telling me that i was a horrible person, i had to help her, i didn't care about her, etc. by this point the other people in the computer area are hearing her scream at me over my phone and i'm getting quite a few stares. i tell her in a tense voice that i had to get off the phone and for her to send me a message. some of you may be getting ahead of me here and see where this is going and think in advance i'm an asshole, but please reserve judgement. i promise it's worth it. my facebook chat window starts lighting up with more insults. i realize that this may bite me in the ass (remember about how i don't respond well to things i see threatening) and start to steer the conversation asking her details - and she gets dragged along. i confirm in the chat that she was pregnant. i confirm in the chat he ran out on her. i asked why he ran out on her as i thought the two of them were close and she tells me that there was a chance it wasn't his. i tell her that once again, i can't help her as i need to catch a bus tomorrow morning. up to this point i'm willing to wish her luck and let it go; i start a new life tomorrow. she then drops a bombshell on me. "if you don't help me with this, i'm going to tell everyone that it's yours and that you raped me." oh hell no. she did not just say that. and then i realize - she said it over facebook chat. instead of warning her, instead of telling her to fuck off, i instead start thinking about what a false rape accusation would do to me on the eve of everything that's about to change for my life. i have one thought, borne out of the survival mode that got kicked into high gear - destroy this bitch. and i know how to do it. i ask her if she's serious when she knows there's no way the kid is mine. she says she doesn't care. i ask her who she thinks is going to believe her. she says it's my word against hers and who are people going to believe? her, or some homeless fuckoff who lives in his car? knowing i know have enough ammo, i pretend to reluctantly relent. i tell her "goddamnit, fine, i'll help you but i can't take you to the clinic tomorrow. it will have to be later this week. i have to change my plans, let me call you tomorrow." she agrees. i then get to work. within a few minutes, the chat transcript has been sent to about a hundred people on her friendslist, and i tagged all of our mutual friends. the chat was also linked on her church page and her employers page. i also sent it to her parents for good measure as an afterthought. almost instantly, my phone starts to blow up. i shut off my laptop, shut off my phone, and went out to my car to spend my last night in it. there's not much i can say about the fallout that will do it justice more than what's probably playing in your heads. sides were chosen, legal threats were made, firings happened, death threats were thrown around. needless to say, her reputation was completely ruined to the point that she not only had to delete all forms of social media, but she had to move clear across the country to get rid of the stigma from the small town she grew up in. over the top? maybe. but it was so, so sweet. it warms my heart on cold winter nights.in college, my brother and i were taking a class together which was basically a public speaking awareness elective. we had to attend 6 university forums. one night at the first one of these terribly dry presentations, my brother and i were seated in the back of the auditorium near the entrance -- right next to a hand-lettered, moveable sign that read "please no food or drink in the auditorium." out of boredom, we started picking the letters off of the board and rearranging them. the final result left the board reading "old penis in the rum drink". this seemed like the best possible combination. we had a chuckle and forgot all about it. after leaving, i realized i had left my keys under my seat, so i went back inside only to find several faculty appalled at the public obscenities someone left on their precious sign. the most outwardly upset of the bunch coincidentally also happened to be my 80 year old statistics professor. he was a heinous old fuck. it pleased me to see him helplessly perturbed, so we made it a point to change the sign every week while attending the forums. week after week, it became more challenging to ninja our way to 60 seconds alone with the sign as they had started covertly guarding it during the presentations. but week after week, upon leaving the gathering, everyone was again saluted with old penis in the rum drink as they went home. it was a slow continuous burn. on the final forum of the semester, two of the old bastards shouldered the sign the entire night. so, anticipating this we simply hand wrote several poster boards with our mantra: old penis in the rum drink! and taped them all over the lobby walls. this caused the old professor and his humorless gang to almost shit themselves. they ran around pulling down the posters as the student body exit the theater laughing at them hysterically. you see, we had become a hero of the people. to put one final nail in this angry mathman's heart, the morning before our statistics final, my brother and i found our way into the classroom early, pulled down the projector screen (knowing it would not be used in class), and left one final message written on the whiteboard behind it. as class was starting, in walks angry, old dr. statistics, he promptly raises the out-of-place projector screen and bam! old penis in the rum drink!i originally posted this story in /r/pettyrevenge , but a few people pointed out that it might belong here as well, so here it goes: a few years ago, i was at my city airport, about to board on a very short (50-minute long) airplane trip to another city. i did the whole procedure, registered my tickets, sent my luggage to be wrapped and stood still in the corner. now, this is important: i was dressed with a white t-shirt and a black pair of pants, looking really formal, so i looked like someone from the airport staff, specially because i was standing close to the airport map, staring at nothing waiting for my flight. i heard a commotion in the hall next to the check-in area, looked there and then i saw him: the asshole. dude was giving everyone in the airport - staff and passengers - a very hard time, demanding priority in the check in service and making a huge scene. apparently, he was too wealthy to just wait in line like everyone else. he screamed so much, one of the staff girls actually cried. i heard he was trying to get a flight from curitiba to campinas (two cities in brazil), which was exactly the flight i was in. so i saw an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to avenge the poor girl and the rest of the staff: i went to the departure section and just stood still next to the place where you go to board the planes, with those "tubes" that connect the bulding to the planes. this is what i mean, i don't know if usa airports have this kind of stuff. anyway, i stood in the long corridor, and when he came close to me, i asked him "are you sir flying to campinas or to rio de janeiro?" "campinas" he said in that disgusting voice. "that way" i pointed to one of the tunnels entrance to my left. if he made past this point in the building, it meant that somebody already checked his id and ticket. so nobody would question him when he got into the plane i pointed, which means that he was not going to campinas. actually, god knows where he might have ended up if he didn't realize he was in the wrong plane. tl;dr: dude was being rude and violent in the airport, redirected him to the wrong plane to teach him a lessoni have a colleague who loves listening to his music on his computer. unfortunately, his choice of music is some or other wailing gospel stuff that sets my teeth on edge. we're in an open-plan office, so music and additional noise are not welcome. when he first got a desk next to mine, he played his music for a bit. i asked him to turn it down, and he did - for a while. the next time, it was back at the usual volume. so i gave him a spare pair of earphones, figuring that might be nice and subtle. he wore them once, and then the music was back. fortunately, i'm a network admin at work, so i have administrator access to his pc. i used a remote process-killing application to kill windows media player the moment he walked away from his pc. after this happened a number of times, he switched to using itunes, so i killed that too. then vlc, and then winamp. it drove him insane. he'd leave his desk, and the music would stop. i even killed it remotely from home once or twice, just so he wouldn't suspect me. eventually it all became a little tiresome, and i haved his pc's registry, killing the sound card drivers, and all sound on his pc ceased. he never figured that out; he did reinstall windows recently, a year later, and the sound works, but he has not played music since. my process-killing scripts are ready...so, this story is going to sound fucked up from the title, but just to be clear, the divorce was for legitimate reasons out of my control. i just happened to help the realization leading to it. at the private school i grew up in, i became friends with dylan. now, dylan and i became great friends because we both were class clowns and had a lot of fun with it. little did i realize dylan actually hated me and talked shit behind my back because he wanted to be the "funniest kid in class" and didn't like sharing that title. little did i know the amount of shit he would talk about me behind my back, the crap he would say about my family, my personality, etc. etc. i was, however, frustrated with when he started putting on this tough guy attitude. since i don't like fighting and prefer to settle disputes with words, he'd always try and pick a fight with me, knowing i'd never fight back. my parents are disciplinary as fuck and would beat the hell out of me for anything like that, so hell no am i fighting. he would apparently fuck with me whenever i invited him on birthday sleepovers such as literally kicking my ass, fucking with my toys, etc. i assumed it was other friends, but turns out it was him. but this is what truly set me off. i started getting a passion for art. almost any kind. because i was forced into math and science but art made me feel like i could be creative and have more control. i'm still in math and science today, but i love to sing, cook, draw, and write! so one day, i spent three hours in school drawing the greatest panda ever. the shading, the colors, and just overall, this drawing was perfection. i fucking love pandas, and this was my greatest accomplishment. so dylan takes my drawing and goes like, "oh this looks cool! i'll take it!" i save face and fake it like i don't care, and say, "oh whatever, i can make a new one anyways!" but it was clear from my eyes that i was pissed. so, this bitch decides to fuck with me and say, "then i guess you don't care if i do this!" and tears up the fucking drawing. right in front of me. i spent so much time on that, and it made me love drawing and he killed it. petey the panda, i will fucking avenge you. once i was fuming a few weeks later, some friends told me everything he'd do. they felt guilty for hiding it, and didn't want to anymore. i forgave them, and told them it was all ok. but now i was epically mad. i was ready to strike. and upon petey's grave, i will lay a vial of dylan's tears. a month or so later, he invited me to his house for his birthday sleepover (to fuck with me), but i planned. for a 11 year old, i was pissed off. little did he realize that my dad knew about how dylan's mom and dad were starting to fight. having overheard this between my parents, i knew what my revenge would be. at 3am, i decided to sneak into his parents' room and brought some lipstick i "borrowed" from my cousin. i went to some of his dad's shirts in the back and put the lipstick on my lips and kissed the shirt collar all over the collar. i did this to a few shirts in the back part of the closet, and then i quietly snuck back to the bathroom, washed my lips off, and then snuck back into bed. the next morning, nothing had happened, but apparently, dylan wanted to prank me later after lunch. fortunately, my parents planned on picking me up after breakfast, and i silently left. a month or so later, i hear my dad telling my mom how dylan's parents are getting divorced because dylan's dad cheated. i was shocked that my plan actually worked. turns out, it worked, but his dad was actually cheating. when his mom saw the lipstick marks on the collar, she started looking through his email accounts, and found a lot of "interesting conversations" in some of his secondary emails. and lastly, she caught him in the act after all of this snooping, and that naturally was the final straw. dylan became a really quiet kid after that, and would rarely talk to anyone. he turned into a loner, and teachers were having problems with him because of this too. apparently, he became known as "the boy with no emotion" because he'd rarely ever speak or laugh or cry or anything. i gotta say, i kinda hoped that his parents would just wind up having a fight or something small, but when i wound up giving the step that led to everything unveiling.... well, that surprised the hell out of me. but i still avenged petey, though.so a couple of years ago i worked as a cdl driver for a small construction company in a dumpy little oil town in utah. right when i had my interview with them, i knew they were real jerks by their attitudes, but hey i needed money and was still going through flight school. the owner and his cronies would drive up in their huge trucks every morning and belittle anyone who didn't have a huge truck or be in their circle of douchiness with them. (i drove a subaru) since nobody had a cdl except one other guy, i had to drive their crappy dump truck and pull a work trailer. this truck wasn't licensed with dot and neither was the trailer. they wouldn't pass inspection, so the cronies would drive out to the job site ahead of me and scout out any dot vehicles waiting to pull people over. if the coast was clear, i would drive out to the job site. it gets worse. they also had a hydrovac truck. this was a piece of equipment that would blast a jet of high pressure water into the ground to break it up, and then suck up all the mud. it was primarily used to expose leaky oil pipe lines to be later fixed, and then suck up all the remaining contaminated mud after it was sprayed. it's a glorified wet vac. you could tell where a pipe was leaking because the ground turned grey and black. i had to drive this piece of equipment too. after the contaminated mud was sucked up, i asked where the disposal unit was so i could dump it. (i worked up in north dakota before this and took extensive classes about not to break the law with illegal dumping) the douche management squadron (who were all brothers) looked at me funny and said to just "go dump it in a ditch". i was completely surprised and warned them of the consequences of doing that. they didn't care and said to "just go dump it in the company lot" then. (basically a dirt field by the shop) the general manager then followed me out to the lot and watched me dump it. i knew it was wrong and took pictures of the dump spot with my phone. to make a long story short, this oil dumping happened three more times- all of which someone was with me in the truck to make sure i did it, even after i warned them. all times i was able to stealthily take pictures with my phone. i started to be treated very poorly after about a month and a half of working there, all because i warned them about the dumping and i didn't fit into their crowd. the manager would tell me to do a job a certain way, and then another assistant manager would tell me to do it differently. when the manager got pissed i did it the other way, the assistant manager would throw me under the bus and say i wasn't compliant. one day i was pulling a flatbed trailer to a job to pick up a huge trencher. the white trash crony loaded it completely wrong and non-compliant with dot regs. i changed the way it was loaded to be legal and the crony got mad and said "it's fine, i've been around trucks for years." ....even though he wasn't the one with a cdl. i told him i wanted to be legal in case i was pulled over, and he went and told the higher up manager. the next day the manager fired me in front of all the co-workers because he said he didn't have a good feeling about me. i was pissed, but had been looking for other jobs at this time, so not too upset. i told him "fine" and turned in my equipment and left. the next day, i emailed the epa about what happened and told them i had pictures. i also called the dot and told them all about the dodgy behavior and crap equipment/trucks on the road. wouldn't you know it! the epa got back to me within a couple of days, and i had three separate interviews with the same agents at my place. i showed them pictures, and gave them gps coordinates. they went out to the dump sites and took pics of their own. they later had me come to their building and verify employees with pictures, and said it was a serious case. i told them that i really reported the company out of spite, even though i knew the dumping was illegal. they understood and were going to take it seriously. i'm not sure what happened or what is going to happen. i know the dot would've done an audit and ticketed them. the government can take it's time to handle things, so i haven't asked for updates with the epa. i know they were a little sidetracked with that huge gold mine tailing spill into the animas river around the same time. i do have the agent's cards and could call, but i haven't yet. the owner and managers of this company were awful, even despite my warnings. you don't mess with the epa. karma's going to catch up with them. tldr: a trashy construction company wanted me to illegally dump oil, so i sicked the feds on them. this is a two parter with a very statisfying ending, posted originally in /r/idontworkherelady/ [here]( where it was suggested that i post it here as well. **part i** so one day i am shopping at my usual supermarket. as i so often do i have my headphones in: so i don't hear what's going on round me. i primarily rely on my eyes to notice what is happening. anyway there i was, all paid and putting my groceries into my bag, when suddenly a dripping cup of potato salad appears in front of my eyes. dripping oily marinade into my bag and all over my groceries. i look up and see a red round angry face (rraf) saying something to me. so i pop out a headphone. rraf: "... fucking now." at this point i didn't realize one thing: he was speaking english. as you can tell by this single sentence: where i live we speak a different language, but as i speak and hear english almost all the time. i don't realize that at the moment. me: "huh?" rraf: "this potato salad is leaking. get me a new one! right fucking now, you lazy fuck." me: "um ... why?" his beheaviour hasn't really sunk in yet. rraf: "that's what you bag boys are supposed to do! you lazy fuck!" okay now i have caught on. me: "hey asshole, i'm not a bag boy." rraf: "whatever you are get me a new potato salad." me: "hey moron, i'm just shopping here." which was when he saw the potato salad in my bag. rraf: "then just give me yours." 'reaches for/into my bag and forces his cup of potato salad into my hands. "it's covered in marinade!" he made a disgusted face and tossed it back into my carefully packed bag. "get me a new potato salad." i have had enough by then. i took my bag and walked "into" the store to dump his potato salad in a trash can. he turned even redder before i left the store. i can't even begin to rationalize how he could have reasonably thought that i was a bag boy. 1. around here there are no bag boys. 2. i was a military-looking black jacket. the supermarket employees all wear red polos. 3. there were two other people packing their shopping bags. **part ii** later that night as i arrived at my work i was introduced to my new manager: red round angry face. well fuck ... or not. his predecessor introduced him as the new "temporary manager" who would get the office into shape until a "permanent manager" would take over. turns out i don't work there, but i do work for rraf. neither of them realize: those are code words ... for me. i know the company ceo and almost everyone directly underneath him, but there are a few layers of hierarchy between them and me. i am officially an independent contractor with a fixed hourly rate that is independent of my work time (day/night) and the office manager is supposed to call me in as necessary. my secret is: i am the company hitman. due to the nature of the company people in manager level positions have very generous severance packages ... unless they are fired for cause. i can see why they want to get rid of rraf. long story short: we both act as nothing happened, but he schedules me to work full night shifts for a month, which suits me perfectly fine given my hourly rate. the problem is: he was supposed to work these shifts instead of me. strike one. his computer doesn't properly log his weekly reports, because of a crappy security system. usually i help people with that, but though luck. company headquarters flags him as non-compliant. strike two. finally, a month in he calls me into his office and tells me that i am fired. that my services were no longer needed. never mind that i cannot be fired without authorization of the division manager. strike three. he was fired the day after. i was asked to supervise him clearing out his office and was probably grinning like a moron the whole time. **tl;dr:** asshole tries to bully me into getting him a new potato salad, starts his new job as my manager and is fired a month later, losing a lot of money. **edit:** to [clarify]( rraf wasn't a new hire, he was a transfer from another office that headquarters wanted to gone as cheaply as possible.been on reddit for a while, but i kid you not, i just discovered this amazing subreddit yesterday. have i been living under a rock? anyway, this is a pretty old story, but it still makes me laugh when i think about it. a few years ago, i was dating some guy for a few months. let's refer to him as d-bag. d-bag had a quiet demeanor, but enjoyed making me laugh and spending time with me. there was something sweet about him, however there were times when i felt like sweet dee from it's always sunny when she was dating lil' kevin and couldn't quite figure out if he had mental handicap. (d-bag wasn't the brightest. he once texted me that 'he has a lot of patients for me.' i asked if he was a doctor. he said 'no, i have so much patients for you, that i will wait for you.' le sigh. not to mention d-bag also had a slight stutter and some serious shifty eyes.) now d-bag was sweet, but at the same time there was something sketch about him. there were a few times when one of us would spend the night, he'd creep into the bathroom some time in the wee hours of the morning to make a hush phone call to somebody. now i am not an insecure little bitch who will quickly start throwing accusations, i need concrete proof first so these weren't exactly red flags for me. but there was this one instance i heard him yelling over the phone at somebody from my bathroom. the yelling was a little muffled, but it sounded like he was trying to reassure someone that he wasn't doing anything bad or so that's what the premise of the conversation seemed to be. i let that instance go and forgot about it a few days later. fast forward to a few days before d-bag's birthday, i am out with one of my bffs for her birthday. we go to a local bar with a few friends and happen to see all of d-bag's friends there, but no d-bag in sight. i'm a little distracted while out at the bar wondering why d-bag's friends are all there, but no d-bag. i obviously drink these feelings away and get super pissed drunk that i randomly end up making friends with one of my bff's friends. let's refer to this friend as accomplice. accomplice and i drunkenly hit it off. it also happens that accomplice lived closed by to me at the time so my bff suggests accomplice hitches a ride with us back. during the car ride, accomplice and i are both spewing a bunch of sorrowful drunken statements on why is it that all the friends of the guy we are seeing was at the bar, but the actual guy was not there? as we both come to the realization that the guy we are seeing could potential be the same guy, we discover this is not the case. saved. although the air is clear of potentially dating the same guy, accomplice asks which friend is it i'm dating. i drunkenly yell "d-bag! d-bag! it's d-bag" repeatedly, followed by "is that bad?" she seems shocked by this, but is reluctant to say what she knows about him. i end up dropping her home without finding any information regarding d-bag, however accomplice and me exchange numbers. the next day, i have plans to take d-bag for an early birthday celebration. some time in the afternoon i receive a text from accomplice asking if i have time to talk over the phone because she has something important to discuss. i'm not busy so she quickly phones in. the conversation goes a little something like this: a: so... remember last night how you said you were seeing d-bag? me: yeah.....? a: how long have you guys been seeing each other? me: a little over 3 months or so. a: oh... me: is that bad? a: well... okay. i'm just going to come out and say this up front, but d-bag has a girlfriend. they've been together for over a year. me: ...son of a bitch turns out accomplice's bff is d-bag's girlfriend. this son of a bitch had me as the other woman. being someone's "option" has never been my style so i am quite furious. accomplice and i devise a grand master scheme to expose d-bag's cheating ways to his girlfriend that very night during the birthday celebration dinner i planned out. i make the arrangements that i will drive d-bag and me to dinner so in the end of the grand master scheme, he will be stranded. but the grand master scheme itself? accomplice and i plan for d-bag's gf to show up at the end of dinner. at 7:30 i pick up d-bag from his house. my insides are crying with delight at the very thought of exposing this motherfucker, but i must remain cool, calm, and collected while being in his presence. we get to the restaurant and have a great time. i am being extra nice and sweet to him, asking him what does he want for his birthday, and promising to take him out to a fancier restaurant on his actual birthday. then we go on to talking about other things and we make this silly bet on how he's never going to kiss me ever again and i say let's bet on it because i know i'm never going to kiss him again. he's so clueless and is laughing about it, like why wouldn't i ever kiss him and that he bets i will by the end of the night. i let out a laugh and say to him "after dinner i have a surprise for you and it's the reason why i can't kiss you." we go on conversing about punishment and karma. he talks about how he believes he'll get punished for bad things he's done and will get his karma eventually. so i say, "you believe in karma? do you think you'll get karma for cheating on your previous girlfriend?" (because he once told me he made the mistake long time ago of cheating on one, but he wasn't referring to current gf) and he says "yeah" with no sadness to his face, all innocence as if he's been a real good guy since then. so i laugh... and laugh... and laugh some more. we get the bill and since i told him i'll take him out on his actual birthday, he covers our dinner. i text accomplice and let her know dinner is over. as a matter of fact, i've been texting accomplice throughout the entire night telling her my status and the silly things d-bag has been saying to me. at one point d-bag steps out for a phone call and when he gets back he tells me "his sister called because she was wanted to know where her macbook charger is." accomplice texts me back saying "he just called his gf to tell her that he's out with his cousin buying shoes." sneaky right? or better yet, ultimate douche bag liar, right? so after he pays the bill, i text accomplice, saying be outside now. as we step outside, i stop d-bag for a second and say "remember how i said i have a surprise for you after dinner?" he says yes... and as we hit the corner boom his girlfriend is there cursing the shit out of him on what a sneaky cheating bastard he is. accomplice and i sit down and watch the entire fight while d-bag has no way of denying me since i am there in the flesh. and as the fight comes to an end, accomplice and gf go their separate way, i go my separate way, and sad little d-bag is left at the restaurant with no ride home (mind you, this is way before uber/lyft days. and sure, d-bag could've easily taken public transportation or called one of his boys to pick him up, but d-bag is a prideful person who wouldn't want to be seen taking the bus and with the grand master scheme, we also planned it on a day that all his boys went out to a city that was an hour away to hit up some club.)short term redditer, extremely fast admirer. this is not my own story, but my dad's during his travel from florida to new york. my father prefers to arrive on at time in anything in life. he's a stickler for that kind of thing. so to my amazement when he told me this awesome story of how he sought revenge, although indirectly, i was grinning ear to ear while listening. of course my father arrives on time to his flight. at boarding time the plane was a bit empty, something like 2 or 3 rows was empty in the very back and my father loves to sit in the back because it's less stressful (and proven to be safer in the event a plane crashes). so there is freedom to choose the seat you want, and my father does so. bags put in the overhead compartment, empty seats on either side of him and life is bliss. that is until the plane is delayed. a minor inconvenience, but nothing too detrimental. 5 minutes pass delayed, then 10 minutes, then 20, then 30. everyone on the plane is wondering why this damn plan won't take off. and then it happens, a family of 5 which we'll call the anuses (father, mother, 2 sons and an infant) board the plane. if you've ever rode on a plane before, you'll understand that this is almost unthinkable. planes love to take off on time and if you're even 5 minutes late you will not be able to board said plane. so here goes the anuses boarding a plane 30 minutes after it's suppose to have taken off. no problem. there are plenty of empty seats and we can finally get rolling. nope! the anuses walk directly to my father and the row he's sitting in and says "these are our seats." well of course my father proclaims that there are a multitude of empty seats and they can just take one of those. nope! they want their seats on their tickets and wasn't having it any other way. another thing about planes. it is federal law that all passengers must sit in their assigned seats in the case of a plane crash, all the bodies can be accounted for and identified. although it's not enforced that much. the anuses must have their seats so they call over a flight attendant (now fa) and explain their situation. the fa sides with them, quoting the law and how my father must relocate. having lost, my father then gets up, collects his belongings and proceeds to move to another seat. the seat he chose? his seat on his ticket, which is about 5 rows up and a middle seat. only problem is, there is already someone sitting there. he tells the guy that it's his seat and he'd like to sit there now. the guy looks baffled when fa chimes in and says "sir there are open seats in the back, why don't you just take one of those?" the fuck?! obviously outraged at this point my father then says "but you just told me to move out of my seat because it was theirs when there was also many seats available. now when i do the same there's a problem?" fa just says the same spiel again but my father doesn't relent, he wants his seat now. he recites the very law she used against him. fa defeated, then asks the guy to relocate as well. this causes a domino effect and the guy goes to his assigned seat and asks to sit there, so on so forth until the entire plane has been rearranged and this plane is now an hour and a half behind departure schedule. the delay in the flight now sets off some red alerts for airport security and the higher ups at this terminal (jet blue i believe.) airport police, upper management and god knows who else are now at the terminal gate to inquire as to why this plane is still here. they board to plane to talk to the pilot about the delay and he says that he held the plane to let some late passengers on board. now that's against policy, because as stated before they like planes to be on time. they inquire a bit more as to the situation and it's all explained by fa, how they arrived late, wanted their seats and then the whole plane had to be rearranged. pissed off that 1. the pilot held the plane to accommodate the anuses. 2. the anuses then asked for their seats which caused a domino effect. and 3. it comes out that the anuses are in fact the pilots family (brother or something), which caused him to hold the plane in the first place they ask that the anuses leave the plane immediately because "you should have never been on this plane from the beginning." reprimand the pilot for abusing his position and indirectly causing this entire fiasco and refund my father's ticket because of the absurd requests by the anuses. the plane finally takes off 2 and a half hours later, my father has a full refund (about $500) and the anuses has to wait for the next flight (this was all at 11pm.) good flight? i think so. edit: people are commenting that it was "their seats" and they have every right to ask for them. yes, you're absolute correct in that aspect. but then you also comment that it was a full family and maybe they wanted to sit together? in this aspect no you're wrong because, as stated in the story there was 2-3 empty rows, on both sides of the plane. if anyone has ever rode a plan there is usually 3 seats per row, on either side of the plane. making it a total of 6 seats per aisle (a1-a6) so there was a potential 12-18 seats available, my father taking up 1 of those seats. it's extremely unreasonable to arrive late then ask for my father to move, when there was 17 other seats available. more than enough space for them to sit as a family. also i do not know when or how he bought his tickets, but if he bought them late, anyone who has ever bought a plane ticket before knows that you don't have a choice in which seat you buy anymore. it's first come first served and the reason the plane was that empty anyways was because it was a very late night flight. my father likes to board the plane last, so when walking through the isle he saw his seat was taken, to which he decided fuck it i'll just go sit in the back because i was the last one on the plane and i know no one is going to come claim these seats. some also commented that the plane being delayed is up to the airline. unless you work for an airline its pretty safe to assume the reason the plane was held for 30 minutes was because the pilot held it, for his late family to board to plane. edit 2: grammar? plus no one is denying the fact that my father might also be an asshole in this situation. in my personal opinion, taking revenge isn't taking the high road and anyone who elects to take revenge is inherently an asshole in that given situation. very few stories on this prorevenge subreddit are they actually not assholes as well. 2 assholes don't make a saint, but 2 assholes make a right. i had actually forgotten about this story, until i read something similar on /r/pettyrevenge, kind of a long one, i am not sure if it belongs here but i have to say the effects were devastating for the victim of my wrath...anyways here it goes. so there i was in 12th grade, last year at last! top of my class, very lanky and non-confrontational little me had all the traits of a wild nerdus geekus. enters humongous shithead (hs), not just your common asshole at school, nobody liked him in my class for very notable reasons: - compulsive liar - made fun of people in every way possible - massive hypocrite, would preach how snitching is for cowards but would be the first one to rat out other people. he was specially assholey to me. i was the first to talk to him on his first day, and we became friends, or so i thought, because after a few days i realized that he was just using me to get to know other people and escalate the social chain, and what do you know he started making fun of me every chance he had. this went on for the rest of the school year and it was so frustrating to see him come to school every day (i would celebrate passionately in my head whenever he missed class which was rarely). but well that time of the year came again, it was finals week, but not any finals, the finals. i should mention at this point that hs was a below average student and not bright at all in any of the subjects, and he always tried to cheat on the tests. i was fairly prepared for the exams and even though the class was big, somehow he ended up sitting close to me for the math exam. the exam starts and as the first 20 minutes pass, hs's little brain can't handle it anymore and he starts asking me questions 'silently', and it suddenly came down on me like a bucket of cold water, this asshole's chance to graduate is in my hands (you were not allowed to graduate unless you passed all courses), at first i was reluctant to go through with it, but then i remembered what a douchebag he was to me, so i thought fuck it... dialogue: hs: hey man whats the answer to number 3??? (lets imagine number 3 was a 2+2 question, the idiot still had to show work but whatever, he wanted the answers) me: it's 9 (2+2=9 pretty out of the line eh? i knew he wouldn't notice the change though because the questions were too complicated for him...) this continued and i gave him all the other answers to all of the questions (all being bogus numbers i came up with), at the end of the test he didn't even thank me, i mean come on i just ruined your school year, the least you could do is show gratitude! fast forward a couple of weeks later, this guy failed the math class because of that final and he had to take math summer classes. naturally he failed them too and had to repeat the year! oh but not only that, i caught a glimpse of him crying while his dad took him by the ear out of school to their car... it was already enough satisfaction for me, but after graduating and starting university overseas, i went back to my country just to discover that he failed 12th grade again and dropped out of school, he works in a local subway now, and i plan to pay him a visit the next time i go back, just so he can make me a sandwich. the moral of the story kids is, never fuck with the person that you need help from. tl;dr highschool bully needed help with his graduating final, i gave him all the wrong answers, and ruined his school graduation. edit: wow didn't expect to get this much attention! to the people wondering if he would spit on my sub, he wouldn't because i would be able to see when he would be prepping it, good thing he didn't work in another restaurant. a few decades ago, i was serving in the navy, stationed at naval training center to do some schooling. we were all young there, 18-20, and everyone had been in the navy about a year at most. a few of us did drugs. not a lot, just dropped acid once a month or so, usually off-base. being in a strange place, lsd was tough to get sometimes. we were all cool and kept it quiet. we were all decent students, good friends, and everyone there looked out for one another. then there was redneck randy. randy was from a small southern town where his unusual surname family were moderately well-off and very well known. coming from a being a big fish in a small pond, randy was entitled. i mean, entitled to the point of being a sociopath. constantly borrowing money without repaying it, copying everyone's notes for class, getting duty switched around to favor his plans. he even doubled-parked his giant pickup truck in the base parking lot. just grade-a douchebaggery. cripes, he even bragged to me one time that his grandfather was ex-klan. *"i ain't ashamed to say my grandaddy wore a sheet".* well, after a few months, randy stopped going to class. he was still in the barracks, but he never mustered for school or marched to class with us. when asked about it, randy said he'd been moved to an 'elevated program' elsewhere on base, working on a project for the navy. we all just assumed he'd entitled himself into another gig. which he had. you see, randy had become a **narc.** around this time, he also suddenly began talking about drugs. not 'sell me drugs' kind-of talk, more like how many drugs he'd done in his life, how many piss tests he'd cheated, how easy it is to get away with drug use. that kind of thing. we realized later he'd been 'laying the groundwork' for insinuating himself into the circles of those who did do drugs....a group he never really associated with, except to borrow money or notes. after a few weeks of this, he had himself a fish; my roomie. roomie told me randy had met a guy in another barracks who sold a bit of acid, and would be willing to part with a sheet, if we'd keep it quiet. randy had bought from this guy many times and swore he was legit. although we avoided randy, he kept pestering roomie into buying until roomie said ok. roomie went to go meet the 'dealer' one day after class, and wound up in handcuffs. if i hadn't had duty that day, *i'd have been in handcuffs, too.* we quickly put the pieces together. skipping class, his talking about drugs, him pressuring us to buy. randy even 'swore his roommate to secrecy' and admitted he had done this to avoid a bad conduct discharge. he'd been caught with cocaine and talked the base police into working as a narc to lessen his punishment. his roommate told us this and informed us randy was getting discharged in a week, himself. why did his roommate tell us? fucking randy had casually offered to turn him onto some stuff a month earlier. and his roommate didn't even use. randy just needed a victim, and anyone would do. on the day randy was supposed to get discharged, he parked his truck next to the barracks. too lazy to carry his stuff all the way around to the lot, he'd toss his stuff out the window and walk around the barracks to pick it up and put it in the truck. i watched him toss two seabags outside from my window, two doors down. when i heard the door slam, i jumped out the window and threw them into my room. by the time randy got around the building, his stuff was gone. if the story stopped here, it would have been posted in r/pettyrevenge. but it doesn't. you see, later that night, when randy was driving back home, we opened his seabags. aside from a cd player and a case full of led zeppelin cds, the seabags were mostly clothes. mixed in with those clothes, though, were randy's discharge papers, including his dd214. underneath those, we found randy's address book and (i shit you not) a phone book from his county down south. it didn't take long for the 4 of us to formulate the plan. our fury at randy was the fuel that ran the engine of our retribution. we called everyone in the address book and told them what randy had done. his parents, his siblings, his aunts, uncles, and cousins all got a call. we called former employers and old friends of his. about half of the numbers were girls in town (randy was quite the ladies man). they all got a call. we had xeroxed his dd214 &amp; 'arrest report' and offered to send a copy to anyone who didn't believe us. only four took us up on it. his family members &amp; former employers got a copy anyways. the only people we spared were his grandparents. that was the address book. from there we moved onto the white pages. almost everybody with unusual surname in the county got a call. we typed up the story at the base library and made about 70-80 copies. they, along with copies of the dd214 &amp; arrest report got sent out to any business in town with unusual surname, as well as any business we thought might be associated with randys family. hell, we even sent a few copies to some businesses we saw were next to unusual surname business. every law firm in town got a copy, as did the local paper. three people on randys street got a copy. for the grand finale, we called the local police department, pretended to be base police and informed them of the incident, reminding them he would be returning to their area in a few days. they got a copy of the arrest report/dd214 too, of course. when all was said and done, we made about 60 calls and sent out about 70 copies to the people &amp; businesses of randys small southern county. we had a dozen or so copies left, so i mailed them to randy himself over the course of 6 months, one every few weeks. i mailed the last one the day i left for my ship. naturally, all those telephone calls and postage got to be kind of expensive. luckily i had plenty of money from selling randy's cd player to a guy three barracks over. the cds were thrown away. i fucking hate led zeppelin. **tl;dr- *"take advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness; travel by unexpected routes and strike him where he has taken no precautions."* -sun tzu**one night, i was on my way home from work and needed to stop at a gas station. this gas station was right off a very busy, tolled interstate highway and had an attached convenience store, as most do. it was dark out when i pulled up, i started pumping my gas and was headed to the store when another customer stopped me. his truck was at the pump across from me. he went on a sob story about how he just got a ticket for not having money to pay the tolls, being completely out of gas and needing to get home since he accidentally took all of his infant son's formula with him when he left. there was a woman with him, looking through a diaper bag while he related his tale of woe, and right when he mentions the formula, she yells "yeah, all the formula is in here. what were we thinking?!? we really need to get back!" she said her wallet should be in the bag somewhere, but after dumping the contents inside the truck cabin, she lamented that it wasn't there. so yeah, obviously, they were looking for me to give them money. for some stupid reason, i decide to give them the benefit of the doubt. i go into the store, take out $20 from the atm and give it to them. in retrospect, this was such a textbook example of the stranded driver scam, but i guess i was really naive. but then instead of just thanking me for the money, this brazen son of a bitch responds, "thanks, but we really need another $20 to make it home. any way you could get more?" he also promised he'd mail the money back to me if i gave him my name, address and phone number. at that point, i begin to regret giving him anything as all the red flags are registering in my mind at once. both of these people were very unhygienic -- greasy hair, very poor teeth (consistent with meth use), dirty clothes. the man's pupils were dilated a lot more than would be expected under the bright lights of the gas station and he was especially twitchy. likewise, the woman was pacing around, muttering to herself in feigned concern. so yeah, they were both probably high. also, looking at the contents of the diaper bag sprawled across their truck's interior, there was plenty of trash but no baby formula. i thought to myself, if i'm going to ruin these people's night, i needed to be sure, so i agree to get more money but first ask him: "can i see the citation you got? my cousin is a state trooper and could probably take care of it for you. i just need some of the information on it." as i jot down his licence plate number on my phone, he checks his pockets before saying, "oh, hmmm. i have no idea what i did with it. it's ok; i'll just pay it. no big deal." *so, you don't have money for gas, but paying more than $100 on a traffic ticket is no big deal. bull. shit.* i now also noticed the state of his license plate didn't match up with his story. pissed at myself, i'm making my way back into the store and the wheels in my head are spinning: *how can i get back at this asshole?* have them kicked out? *nah, then they'll just go to another gas station and victimize someone else.* call the police? *eh, they might not get here in time.* i'm a few feet from the door when genius strikes. i turn and call over to him: "if you want, you can take my ez pass for the tolls. i don't really need it anymore. it's right on the dashboard; the door should be unlocked." "oh, that'd be great! thanks!" i go into the store and pretend to use the atm while i'm actually using an app on my phone to cancel my ez pass. i report their fraudulent activity to the attendant and hurry back outside. i told the man i couldn't take any more money out of my account, sorry. he's disappointed, but didn't press me. i'm grinning like a smug idiot on the inside, get into my car, notice the transponder is gone and drive off. i pull over a few minutes down the road and call the ez pass office. by some stroke of luck, they're open late that day and i'm able to speak with an actual person. i explain to her that when i got into my car just now, i noticed the transponder was gone. i already cancelled it, but wanted to make sure it was all set. she confirms that it's deactivated and i can come pick up a replacement for a small fee. *eh, not today.* she asks and i tell her where and by whom i suspect the transponder was taken, giving her their license plate number and address of the gas station. she promises to pass the information along to the state police. perfect! a day or so later, the state police call me to say they've recovered my transponder and needed me to come in to give a statement. of course, i obliged. while there, i tried to pry more information on the fate of the con artists but they weren't very forthcoming at all. luckily, i told my cousin the story and she said she'd look into the case for me. according to the report, they got cctv footage from the gas station showing me giving the man money and then him taking my transponder when i went back into the store. afterwards, the meth heads got back onto the interstate and stopped at the nearest rest stop, where they presumably tried their scheme again, before moving on to the next one to repeat the process. eventually, they got off the toll road and onto a different highway. when they drove through the ez pass toll lane, they got flagged for not paying and were pulled over a few miles away. at this point, i was satisfied having caused them to get a &gt;$100 citation, but that wasn't the end of it. the cop notices something's up with the driver and calls for backup. when they arrive, the police officer gave the guy a field sobriety test which he failed and was arrested. while this is going on, the woman flipped out and started running. she doesn't make it far before they catch up to her whereupon she resists arrest. all in all, the guy was charged with dui (not his first time, either), possession (they had some meth in the truck), theft by deception (for the $20 i gave them) and theft (for the transponder). the truck was impounded and the guy got a large fine for operating without insurance along with the ~$100 fine for not paying the toll. the woman was charged with possession and resisting arrest (she also had a record). all in all, pretty sweet revenge. they ended up only being tried for the drug-related charges, but i'm still very satisfied with that along with the fines. it gave my cousin (the cop) a good laugh, too.a few decades ago, i worked it for an up-and-coming tech firm. it was a good place, and i enjoyed working there; however, the company finances were chronically lean, which occasionally resulted in some cutbacks. as a result, i wasn't surprised when an announcement was made that there would be a wage freeze, and that all dept. budgets were being cut. what made this financial episode memorable was how a senior vp dealt with it... it happened that the vps &amp; ceo had been deferring taking some bonuses contractually due them; i'm not sure of the specifics, but apparently the deferrals had gone on too long, and the company finally had to pay them out. to forestall unrest among the rank-and-file, the vps were told in no uncertain terms that they were to keep the news of the payments quiet; one vp, however, went out and bought an expensive, high-end european sports car, and started driving it to work - this in turn raised some eyebrows among those whose previously-okayed pay increases had been put on hold, and whose department budgets has been slashed. this vp was also more trouble for the it dept. than the rest of the company put together; about this time there was one particularly unpleasant interaction where he'd gone off on us due to a problem he'd been experiencing for a few weeks (due to his own ineptitude and unwillingness to cooperate with us to try &amp; fix it). this last episode was one which justified payback... our parts cabinet soon contained a 10 ml syringe and a bottle of castor oil; about once or twice a week one of us would happen to squirt a syringe-full of castor oil up the tailpipe of his new car. the result of this was when the exhaust pipe of the car heated up enough to burn off the castor oil, the car would emit a massive plume of opaque smoke! since he lived close to work, the pipe wouldn't heat up enough to start smoking during his commute, making it seem to happen randomly. needless to say, this took the enjoyment out of the pricy new toy he was showing off! given his personality, it was a given that he'd go back to the dealer and read them the riot act when they couldn't find anything wrong with the car; eventually, they did find something to "fix" which wasn't covered by warranty and apparently cost him a sizeable chunk of change. the "injections" then ceased for a few weeks, only to start up again; by this time, he was disgusted enough with the car that he sold it at a bargain price, just to be rid of it. the new owner got a great deal - the castor oil didn't damage the car at all, since it was at the end of the exhaust pipe and downstream of all sensors, etc. [edit- spelling, clarity]asshole neighbors have a habit of turning music right up loud every weekend. with a shared ceiling, thin walls, and their tendency to go off and threaten us when we ask them to turn it down, i found a tiny, simple solution yesterday… switched 4g off, got my phone on edge, and browsed some heavy sites while moving it around the wall. bingo, found a place that makes that delicious zzzzt zzit zizt zit zzzt of an edge connection through their speakers, and let it do its thing. radio went off within 5 minutes and every time it goes up again back comes the edge. bliss. haven't heard it above a murmur since.let me start off by saying that i love my dog. this story starts a couple years ago in a small, but very nice and quiet neighborhood. most people own their homes and everyone takes pride in ownership besides the house next to mine.the house next to mine is section 8.. meaning government assistance/welfare pays all the bills and usually some form of trash lives there. this certain piece of trash this story is about, well let's call her fraggle rock, because she looks like one. this bitch moves in and immediately starts partying. i mean like an every day, all day booze and drug fest. she is selling pills, smoking crack and doing heroin on her back porch, throwing trash (drug bags everywhere) all over my property, brings her druggie crew around my house and keeps my family up really late with there loudness. i really dislike her at this point but i ignore her. her boyfriend is extremely violent and they beat each other constantly, the 4 year old child she has is dirty looking, neglected with behavior problems, and has to witness this shit. it was awful, but none of my business. i spoke to the fraggle one time when she first moved in. i explained i had a really big dog and to just ignore her as she barks a lot but will eventually get used to her like she had with the other neighbors. we were actually removing a swing set off of the property line when i spoke to her. our 6 foot privacy fence was put up about 15 foot away from where our property actually ended and i seen she had a small child and i did not want to get sued because her child got hurt on it (my property). the landlord lives in a different state and is very absentee. he is also an asshole. fast forward a couple months, most of my family went on vacation to another state for an entire month and as soon as i returned, not even 2 hours later i am hauling suite cases from the trunk of my car, mr. out of state landlord comes by and says his tenant is complaining about me looking in her windows and we need to stay on our side of the fence. that brings about an argument.. first of all, i can be on my property all i want. 2nd of all, we have been out of state for a month and haven't been on that side of our property since the fraggle moved in and we removed the swing set. i told the landlord i will be moving my fence closer to the property line. i am unsure where all the accusations came from, her crack smoking probably had everything to do with her bogus claims. i was now agitated with this bitch and she even went as far to call city officials the day i started moving my fence, after we called her over and showed her our survey spikes. around this time i noticed our mastiff, who was treated badly by previous owners and behaves like a guard dog has taken a particular disliking for them so i start watching out my window when i hear her growling. i wish i hadn't seen what i saw... one of her daily regular buyers was jamming a stick through my fence and into my dogs face. he actually broke my fucking fence doing it. i ran outside and screamed " you fucking asshole, you will fucking pay for this". i was upset and my dog had a mark on her face. he ran inside and i seen the fraggle peeking out from behind her curtin fucking laughing. the very next day the little boy is beating on my fence with a hammer and my dog is on the other side flipping out. i yelled at him to get his mother now but she would not come out to talk to me. a few more days later the kid is throwing dirt into my dogs eyes over my fence. the next day he is back with the hammer. i go to city hall and ask the lady there to contact the landlord asap and give him my phone number. i never got a call back. another incident happens with the same original drug buyer friend of hers, he is smoking a blunt with the little child only feet away and my dog is barking. i am right there in my back yard and see and smell it all. he kicked a big ass hole in my fence and actually kicked my fucking dog. that was it. i had it. i went to the police- not something i would normally do but i did not want to lose my dog when one of these asshole gets bit. i talked to the cop, we discussed the entire situation, the parties, drug deals, the domestic violence and he told me the only way to get her out since she was section 8 and the landlord was uncooperative, was to call in her drug deals and she would be kicked off government assistance as soon as she was convicted. it only took one day of calls and i shit you not, 17 fucking calls the first day, all with license plate numbers. the next day i heard her yell talking to one of her drug fein girlfriends ( her voice was always loud and shrieky so i can hear and understand most of her outside conversations from my living room) about a bunch of her friends getting locked up the day before and she didn't understand why or how this was happening. at this point i believe the cops called cps. they started coming around but she was not answering the door. one day she left the child unattended and he was playing on the main street. a family around here noticed and walked the little boy home but no one was home to watch him. cps was waiting out front this time. she somehow still had her kid after that but not for long. there was one more incident with my dog. a different druggie friend decided it was a good idea to pelt my dog with rocks. i couldn't believe this was happening still and was beside myself the hell i was going through. i was in my yard all the time because i had to be, it was a serious inconvenience to be in the yard every time my dog wanted to be outside but i felt it was the only way to make sure these people didn't harm her. i lost my mind that last time and started pelting this guy back with rocks. the fraggle was on her back porch knocked out and she awoke briefly to let out a snorty the pig laugh like it was a fucking game. the fraggle likes to drink and drive. since the drug deals only got her buddies busted and not her i decided i would wait and watch and call in her next drunk driving adventure. . she had to go! it didn't take very long. a few days later her violent scum bag boyfriend stole her purse and jumped into a car that was waiting and took off. i heard her scream "my pills, give me my fucking pills!" i see her stumble to her car, completely shit faced, hop in, and peel wheels in hot pursuit. i call it in. the poor child was outside in the snow barefoot. that is a perfect example of her priorities. the cops arrested her and i knew that because cps came the next day after the child never went to school. they found the little boy there all alone, just how he had been the whole night. the bitch was too worried about getting in trouble to disclose to the cops she left the child.. a 4 year old, home alone. really sad but hopefully he has a new family now or at least will one day. the fraggle returns a day later. no car, and she stops going to whatever job welfare forced her to have. the violent boyfriend must have been in jail still from her purse snatching incident because there's a new scumbag boyfriend hanging around with track marks visible a mile away. well violent boyfriend gets out of jail and runs up in the house. i seen the whole thing as my doggy is freaking out. dope head boyfriend and violent boyfriend start fighting. there is a bat and blood. i decide this is my chance to get the cops in the house and finally get these fucking pieces of trash out. it was a sight.. cops come, guns drawn, dope head runs inside and violent bf runs through the other neighbors yard. in the end, they all went to jail. unfortunately it wasn't the complete end, when she got out of jail she smashed the back window and squatted there for about a week. i didn't bother calling the cops because i knew the house was getting damaged and it felt good knowing the landlord would have to fix it and section 8 will not pay for damages. fraggle is gone. i've seen her once around town. she's living on the streets. lost everything and she really had it all and her life was so easy living off the government. i told that fucking bitch not to fuck with my dog. she should have listened. before i got clean, i bought most of the oxycontin i was hooked on from my friend's husband. she had a good heart but he was a giant turd. eventually he ripped me off. (i paid, he said he'd have pills soon, i never heard from him. when i called to check, he got hostile, said some nasty things, refused to give me anything) i wasn't surprised but i was furious, and i never saw him again. i was the librarian at our local newspaper at the time. one morning on my way to work, i passed his house and saw a bunch of cop cars in his driveway, lights flashing. i was super curious (and admittedly hoping he was in trouble for something) and when i got to the newspaper i went straight to our police reporter and asked him about the cops. he had no idea so he checked a source. it turned out to be something mostly trivial, i've forgotten the specifics, and then asked me what the big deal was. this reporter happened to be a good friend, so i happily explained that the house belonged to my former drug dealer, who had ripped me off and was a giant turd. i said something along the lines of, "you should print something about how awful he is." after i finished ranting about it i said adios and went upon my day. if anything, i expected a one-line brief under police news. instead, the next morning's paper included a fair-sized article covering the previous day's events at my dealer's house and then, delightfully, recounting all his previous criminal activity in detail. his full name and address was mentioned over and over and it was the best thing ever.several years ago i had a coworker who was absolutely worthless. she called in sick at least every other week with some malady, was always out running around, chatting and socializing instead of working and just generally leaving the rest of us to fill in for her. another coworker (who i will refer to as "fed up") were really sick of dealing with her because we were the ones expected to take her calls and take care of her customers when she was out or away from her desk. i had complained loudly and often to my manager to no avail. for some reason she took it as if i were challenging her authority, rather than believing i had a legitimate complaint. one day she basically told me she was sick of hearing about it, i obviously had a personality conflict and to drop it or else. well i dropped it but i was pissed. finally one week, everything came to a head. "worthless" handled one of our large clients and we were getting a lot of calls from their customers. so many in fact, that my supervisor told me and fed up that we needed to help worthless because she couldn't possibly handle all the calls. i was livid. maybe if she spent her time at her desk instead of running all over the office she could handle the calls! anyway, i did what i was told but i fumed the whole time. worthless was also in the habit of leaving early every day. at about 20 min to closing she'd shut down her computer and go sit in another coworkers office and blab for 10 minutes, and then they would leave together while i was still working. one afternoon after she left, i still had about 10 of her unanswered calls so i sent them back to her desk. i figured if she had time to leave early, she had time to return her own calls. well apparently the next day, worthless tattled to the boss, because she came to see me about the phone calls. i'd had it. i told my boss exactly what happened and why i sent the calls back. i guess this time she agreed with me because we didn't have to help her with calls anymore. the whole time this was going on, worthless was bitching nonstop about this client. she was so pissed about having to take all these calls and griped all the time. well she decided to vent on facebook and, idiot that she is, made disparaging comments about one of our biggest clients online. as if that's not bad enough, she was friends with at least 20 coworkers, all of whom saw her rant. most of them were friends in facebook name only, because in reality very few people could stand her. so, one of her "friends" screenshotted the page, printed it out and gave it to fed up. we then mailed the screen shot of her rant to the hr manager from outside the office and sat back and waited. two days later worthless was escorted from the office. rumor has it that hr had her termination paperwork ready before they even called her in. edited to fix some typos, and make the story read a little more clearly.i apologize if this if overly long. i am trying to condense it as much as possible without losing too much of the feeling of the story. my story started the day before orientation into my college program. you see i applied for a very competitive program and never received an acceptance letter till the day before class started. i was also working the day it arrived so i never really got the letter till that evening. after some begging and pleading i managed to convince the dean of the department - a heartless compassionless bitch of a woman - to not count that absence against me. this program had a strict attendance policy where you were given three absent days a semester and would be kicked out on the fourth. they made this very clear, and i didn't want to take any chances so i fought for that first day. a little over a month into the program i was asked to go see the dean. i had been sick for two days prior and i assumed she was going to give me a warning about the attendance policy - others i knew had the talk with her already. when i got into her office she asked for my security badge. i handed it over, slightly confused. she then says "i'm sorry to tell you but you've broken the attendance policy and can no longer attend class in this department". i was irate. my eyes were watering from a combination of fear, rage, and confusion. i explained that i only missed two days. she tells me i missed the two sick days (which i did), she mentioned that i also missed orientation (which i did, but she said she wouldn't count against me), and then she said i missed a fourth day which i actually could prove i didn't with a signed and dated test i took that day. i explained this to her and told her to look at the test which i still had with me. she ignored my proof. i kept trying to talk some sense and reason into this emotionless wench. i made sure to point out that i just spent $5000 on tuition and $2000 on books/supplies. she didn't care. she didn't interrupt me, but she wasn't listening. when i stopped talking she says "you can leave now". the confusion and fear subsided and the rage intensified. i blacked out for a moment and literally wiped my arm across her desk ensuring nothing was left on it when i was done. i broke her picture frames and ornaments she had and even managed to crack her laptop. i stormed out knowing security would be there very shortly. i went directly to the administration office to get a refund, that is when i realized she did this the day after refunds would be given. that smug cunt scammed me. even more pissed i decided to go to our off campus pub where i had planned on meeting some friends later. i was in there a couple of hours when one of my professors walked in. she was a younger professor and attractive. i had been flirting with her since i started the program so i could be on her good side when it comes time for marking. she tells me she just heard i was kicked and my friends in class said i would probably be at the pub. she tells me she has seen the dean pull this stunt a few times and never really thought about what was happening until now. the dean was scamming students by kicking one out after refund deadline and bringing another in - ultimately getting double the tuition for a single seat. i was slightly drunk and my now former professor said that i needed to meet her the next day. so i assumed she had a plan, i hoped she had a plan. the next morning my former professor arrived and i hopped in her car. i drove to another college in the same city (my second choice but equally good). i figured she was going to use a connection to get me into a program, and i was right. but that's not where it ended. her former professor/mentor was also a lawyer and happened to work at this college. we sat down and explained the situation to him and he agreed that we have a case - at least to get my money back. he wrote up a letter to the dean of the department on my behalf. we sent it through registered mail. within 48 hours of sending that out, i received a phone call from the lawyer telling me that the dean has agreed to refund my money in full for tuition/books/supplies. i was happy with that outcome, but still felt like she was getting away with doing this to other people. i explained my concerns to the lawyer and we devised a plan. my former professor was sent an email every time someone was kicked so that she didn't allow them into her classes. all professors got this. she sent me all of them and i tracked down the 30 most recent ones and found that 16 of the 30 were in the same situation. the lawyer and i compiled a list of those names, drafted a letter on their behalf, and sent it to the dean of the department and the president of the college. this time it took a few weeks, but we were both asked to go in for a meeting. we got in and the dean was there along with several board members and school lawyers. we told our story and the dean had her chance for a rebuttal. in it she explained that she was being nice by returning my money since i missed four days. expecting this i had the proof that i did not miss one of those days and presented it to everyone in the room. the meeting ended on that note. a few days later the lawyer was called by the president of the school. the school had terminated the dean for breaking the schools ethical policies. they also agreed to contact each of the students she had personally kicked out for false reasons and refund them their tuition in full. i was so excited that i called my former professor to tell her the good news. i took her out for dinner to thank her for all of her help in this situation. we dated for a few months after that dinner. while we were dating we heard the former dean took a much lower paying job in a much less desirable city. **tl;dr** school expels me for false reasons to get double tuition for each seat in the program. i get her fired, i get myself and several other students full refunds, and i date one of my hot former professors. someone told me to share this here my little brother is probably one of the most kind and pure-hearted kid i know. one of those people who would rather let a spider outside rather than end its life. i, on the other hand, am a cruel and unforgiving person (when it is needed). i'm 5 years older than my brother and was in high school at the time, so i would get home about 30 minutes before he would. we lived within walking distance of our schools so everyday we walked rather than take my car (good exercise). one day my brother gets home with some unusual bruises on his forehead and arms. after some poking and prodding he finally told me that some older shit heads follow him home on their bikes and punch him on occasion. this did not sit well with me. in fact my blood boils just recollecting this event. instead of letting my fury get the better of me and simply beating the spit out of them, i decided to formulate a plan. the next day, i waited for them a couple of blocks away from my house, envelope in my hand, until i finally saw them riding behind my little bro. i could already hear their little mouths spewing so much shit, their assholes must've been jealous. i approached them my brother sees me and stops, a look of worry and confusion on his face. i give him a quirky smile. i walk up to the ring leader and extend my hand with the envelope, drawing his attention away from his front tire. in my best douche-style voice i say "yo man i'm having a killer party this weekend. here is the address and shit". the look of awe and happiness that came over his face was priceless. (being invited to a high school party was a big deal back then) i guess i should mention that as he was accepting my party invite, all while telling me how pumped and excited he was, he failed to notice me nonchalantly jamming a small but solid piece of wood into his bike spokes. he began to pedal, but is quickly upended. with a squeal of terror, his face met the ground with a sound i will remember until the day i die. he cried, lost a tooth, and did something nasty to his nose. his "posse" ran to his aid. i patted my brother on the head and asked him how his day at school was as we walked home. never had any problems after that... also the envelope contained a piece of paper that said "fuck you". **tl;dr** bullies harass and abuse my brother on his walks home from school, i sabotage one of their bikes and the asphalt sexually assaults his face.this is a crosspost from /r/pettyrevenge i made over a year ago before this subreddit existed. this is definitely a more pro than petty revenge story. ---- i apologize for wall-of-text and if this one is a little too technical. this involves a somewhat popular card-based trading game (mtg). i tried to strip out as many unnecessary details as possible to make it easy to read. plus, i don’t remember them all. i usually am not the one to take revenge since i’m risk-averse. however, in this case, i found it was the most logical thing to do since i knew ahead of time that the other guy was going to try and screw me. there was this fellow in my high school. his name was david. he was one grade above me and he was a complete asshole, a compulsive liar and a compulsive cheater. often times during lunch hour, students would get together at the tables to play card games and such. i usually got involved in these games as well. david did too, but not as often. when he did, i watched him. honestly, this kid fascinated me since he was completely blatant about his lying and cheating. i remember distinctly watching him play a game of magic: the gathering with another student and i would watch him take 2, 3, even 4 cards at a time when he should have only been drawing 1. his opponent was completely oblivious to this and was so concerned about her own cards to really pay attention to what david was doing. i just kept my mouth shut. pretty soon he had something like 20 cards in his hand while his opponent had 4-5. it was very ridiculous. i usually avoided playing with him, but i must have played with him at least once. he would continue to cheat in the open until you called him on it. of course, he would try to lawyer himself out of it or tell me i got it wrong. he would try to change the rules of the game to benefit him in the moment for his specific situation. he would throw a fit if you tried to argue and would only back down if you got the whole audience to agree unanimously that he was wrong. playing him was an exhausting experience since you spend more time arguing and watching him than playing the game. it was 1995 at the time, and i had played some magic: the gathering (mtg). i was nearly finished with this game since all the great expansions came out before i even got involved, and people with money held all the power cards. i had dropped my own money in the new expansion “fallen empires”, which turned out to be one of the worst expansions ever made in the game’s history. therefore, i was pretty sour and was basically giving up the game since i didn’t see how i could ever catch up. a guy i knew, alex, decided to organize a starter pack tournament, where the players had to compete with only the cards they got with the starter pack. this sounded like an interesting variation on the game, and i thought i might join to try and squeeze some fun out of this game i was quickly losing interest in. incidentally, david joined this tournament. now, his reputation was well known by alex, but he let david join anyway. the logic being that he needed people, even if those people were assholes. there was only something like 5 people in the tournament so it was hard to argue with that. can you guess whom my first match was against? that’s right. it was fuckface himself: david. now, i didn’t want to lawyer and argue with david the whole game since that was no fun at all. if i was going to play him, i wanted to completely royally screw him over and embarrass him in front of the whole player tournament. a sort of preemptive revenge for the shit i know he was going to pull on me. knowing that he was going to cheat ahead of time gave me some unique opportunities. i felt it relieved me of any ethical obligation to play a fair game. i needed to stack the deck in my favor, so to speak. let me explain what i did. so, each player was given a starter pack and one booster pack (mtg revised edition for those who care). this gave you an assortment of cards that made overall fairly weak decks. most games resulted in waiting for the person to get enough land to play a monster and start doing damage against their opponent. any sizeable monster in play usually results in that player winning since our decks were so weak. in order to give yourself a chance of getting the right cards, you need to strip out all the fluff that was going to do you no good. so your cards were divided into your active playing deck and your reject pile. you only played with your active deck. at the end of the game, the winner gets to draw at random a card to keep from the loser’s active deck or your reject pile. it’s the winner’s choice. this is important later. my deck had an unusually useful card for this sort of tournament called a demonic tutor. it essentially lets you go through your own deck and pick out the exact card you want. if i ever got this card, it would be my key to winning since i could pick out the only monster i have that actually does damage. so now i have two chances of winning. if i draw my monster or draw the demonic tutor. david also had an unusually useful card in his deck as well. i think it was some kind of rare card and he cherished it so much. i don’t remember what card it was, but i remember it did him no good against me. my goal was to completely win the match and then pilfer his precious rare “at random”. to prepare, i took my uberpowerful demonic tutor card and oh so gently, put a tiny fold in the top right corner of the card. this way, if you put it in a deck, you can see it stand out from all the other cards. you only see this if you know what to look for. when we met for our match, we get to browse each other’s cards so we know what to expect. i browsed through his deck and took out his precious rare to admire. while david was too busy looking through my cards, i put the same tiny fold in his rare card and put it back in his deck. i didn’t have time to check if it stood out, so i crossed my fingers. next we shuffled our cards. since i could see where my demonic tutor was, i shuffled it carefully so that it was below the 75% mark in my deck. so when he cut my deck, there’s a good chance that the demonic tutor would end up near the top. if i didn’t end up getting this card, i have a second chance of getting the monster instead. luckily, when he cut my deck, he cut it above my demonic tutor’s location, so i was good to go in that department. next, i cut his deck, but since i could see where his precious rare was located, i made sure to cut the deck so that his card was as close to the bottom as possible and wouldn’t show up during the match. david was too self-absorbed to suspect that anyone other than himself might have evil intentions. things are going well so far, and i’m starting to feel bad for david. i’m starting to question whether what i’m doing is the right thing. these doubts are quickly erased by subsequent events. we start to play. my job here at this point was to watch him like a hawk and call him out every time he tries to cheat. and try he did. he tried to do the whole multiple card-draw on me. i called him out on it. david tried to act like it was an accident. this got the tournament organizer’s attention and david a verbal tongue lashing from alex. alex basically told david to stop acting like an asshole and play the game. this had the effect of crucially destroying david’s credibility and getting everyone in the room on my side. i shined a spotlight on his douchey ways, so to speak. next thing he did was try to lawyer his way to do something that was clearly against the rules. of course, i made a calm but loud enough scene for everyone to notice and eventually called alex over again to adjudicate. alex told him he’s full of shit and ruled in my favor. soon enough, i had the demonic tutor in my hand after several turns since it was near the top. by this time, i had all that i needed but the monster. i pretended to act joyful and surprised when i threw down my demonic tutor and went rifling through my deck to get that monster. david’s face started to go red and his body was very agitated. the next round, i threw that monster on the table with gusto! i celebrated with “yes!” and “i can’t believe it!”. the other people in the room were starting to admire my skill and good luck. they were really watching my game now and clearly wanting to see me win. the best david can do at this point is pull out a monster to block me or somehow get rid of my monster. knowing that the only card that has a hope of achieving that is his precious rare safely at the bottom of his deck, i was inwardly confident, but acted nervous to lead him on that he actually had a chance of pulling one out. every subsequent round, i would attack him with the monster, pinging his life down. of course, during this time, nothing good came out of his deck. slowly, his chances for winning dwindled and his fury grew. then it was over. i celebrated and other people in the room marveled at my amazing play style. david was so mad he was shaking. whenever he spoke, he was petulant and angry. while i was making a big show of celebrating my good fortune, david had already planned and executed his next cheat. he took both his active pile and his reject pile and mixed them together as soon as the game ended. if you recall, these piles are supposed to be separate so that i could choose which pile to pilfer from. by mixing them up, he reduces the chance that i’ll randomly take any of his good cards, including his precious rare. i immediately called him out on it as he’s mixing them together. he starts arguing about the tournament rules and his interpretation of them. i make a big show of arguing and acting like i was cheated. honestly, it didn’t matter that he did this since i could still see where his precious rare was. this final act of cheating showed his petulance and completely ruined any reputation he had in the room. i called over alex the organizer to adjudicate and demand restitution. clearly there was no way to unmix the decks unless you have an entropy reversal device, so the damage was done. alex called david an asshole for what he did, and alex tried to placate my hurt feelings. acting hurt and angry, i told him “fine! let’s get this over with.” david had a smirk under his face, thinking he’d finally pulled one over on me. oh, how wrong he was. while making a show of concentration and trepidation, i spread his deck out and made a show of going after a card, but changing my mind a couple times. finally, “at random”, i pulled out the card with the tiny folded corner and with drama turned it around to show everyone at the same time that it was the precious rare. immediately david let out a scream of anger that made the whole room silent. he quickly packed up all his crap and stomped out of the room. but i had his precious rare. everyone was overjoyed that i had completely and totally demolished david and dealt a slice of righteous karmic justice at the same time. we all agreed how much of an asshole he was and that he got what he deserved. honestly it was the highlight of the tournament. david dropped out of the tournament after that and no one was sad to see him go. i never told anyone about my deception. i think people are happier thinking the universe conspired against david to deliver justice. tl;dr i outcheated the cheater by knowing the future.this revenge story was posted in alt.revenge 15 years ago. once upon a time there was a man who owned a piece of land next to a thriving restaurant. now this man had owned the land for a long time, (22 years), and it was undeveloped. he had bought it cheaply, but it had great highway frontage, and he had always dreamed of building a little used cars lot or gun shop on the tract, as his retirement pastime. now, the man had had the tract zoned as a commercial lot when he bought it, but when news leaked about the upcoming development, the restaurant owners petitioned the zoning board to overturn the commercial zoning, and re-institute the original agricultural zoning. by the way, all land in the mythical state of kentucky is zoned as agricultural by default. this was unfair, illegal, and generally rude, but the restaurateur's brother was the county zoning commissioner, so things naturally turned against our would-be entrepreneur. after fighting the good, clean, play-by-the-rules sort of battle and losing, our would-be entrepreneur gave up. he decided to accept the county zoning. not to see the tract go idly unused, the enterprising retiree decided to pursue another business venture. he raised hogs. lots of them. two hundred and four, to be exact, on his little 12 acre tract. for those of you unfamiliar with the climate in time-lost kentucky, the summers are downright southernly in their humidity and heat. as you can imagine, a rather malignant odor grew up around the thriving hog farm. patrons of the restaurant ate elsewhere, anywhere else to be exact. in a matter of weeks, the zoning commissioner reversed his earlier ruling, returning the commercial status of the lot. it is another caveat of kentucky zoning law that land can always be used for a purpose lesser on the scale of hierarchy than its current zoning. everyone, especially the restaurateur, was surprised when the hog farm remained in operation. nothing, not even substantial financial offers, could convince the new farmer to quit his now beloved occupation. exactly 3 months, and four days after the opening of the hog farm, the restaurant closed its doors for good. the farmer, in a fit of depression, ceased hog farming and decided to open a small sporting goods store instead. it remains there to this day, alongside his newly-acquired restaurant. never spoke much about this revenge, but here it goes. i came home from a double shift at work, only to find someone had shot my two english mastiffs. everyone in my neighborhood knew it was my one neighbor, but no one could prove it. he would make comments alluding to it, but never outright said he did it. fast forward three years later everyone in the neighborhood hates this guy still. he is just a monster. i had a horse that foaled sooner than i thought she would (was told she was due in dec, she foaled in aug). after checking her placenta to make sure it was all there, she gave birth while i was at work, i was at a loss of what to do with the afterbirth. a few days later, i see asshole neighbor put up a beautiful brand new white front door. i knew what i was going to do. middle of the night, i used 2 ice hooks, carried this massively heavy placenta to the front of his house....and heaved that bitch right on his door. all i could see was a dark blob at the upper half of the door, all the way down. he had a new door put up the next day. this happened during my final year of school (which in comparison would be the final year of "high school" ) i was in a boarding school due to a problematic family situation. my roommate this year was the fattest, meanest person i have ever met in my life and she continually made my life a living hell. my problems with her was that she continually stole my stuff, especially my food and snacks. when i locked my stuff in my locker, she threw fits like an angry toddler. another thing i really hated about her, was that she would always eat junkfood at night, often noisy stuff like chips or crackers, and the following morning the package wrappers would be all over the floor. i would always step on crumbs, it was fucking nasty. the staff did nothing about it as they had no proof of her actions. finally i had enough of her, and when the staff didn't want to do anything about the situation, i decided to do so myself. one morning, as i was leaving for school, i opened the window just the tiniest bit. when the students left for school, a teacher was supposed to make sure none of the rooms had any windows open, but when opening the window just right, it would appear to be close while actually being open. during lunch i ran back to my room and went in through the window. this way, the staff in the house wouldn't see me. the lockers in the room had number locks with only three numbers, i tried out the different combinations until i eventually found the right one. i hid every food and snack item in my roommates locker underneath her bed. when i locked up the closet again, i put some metal in the locker slot ( a trick i had been taught by one of the other students. basically you just have to pull a bit harder to get your lock up, but to an idiot it appears as if your lock is stuck). i then went back to school, and no one even suspected i had been gone. in the evening the day continued as normal. at 5pm all students had to be in their room and do homework. i entered my room to the sight of my roommate fighting her locker and wildly complain about how it wasn't working. she couldn't get the lock to open at all. finally she blew a fuse and started kicking and trashing at the door, which made all of the staff turn up in our doorway. she complained about her locker, specifically her lock, but one of the staff members manged to get it open pretty quickly. when her locker didn't hold any of her precious food, she blew yet another fuse and started crying about people stealing her stuff. one of the staff members asked her whatever she was sure she didn't just misplace it and she spit all over his face as she explained to him, in great detail, that she would never misplace her stuff. the staff started searching the room and pretty much immediately found the stuff hidden underneath her bed. they are of course mad as hell about the fact she "misplaced" her stuff and then thrashed her locker in a fit of rage. the episode made way fro me to complain about how i felt unsafe having to be in a room with my roommate, obviously she had anger issues. i was assigned a new roommate. mission complete. my wife was extremely ill throughout her entire pregnancy with my daughter. she missed enough work to eventually be let go. she was due in december, and terminated early in the month (on the day we had our daughter). with a mortgage, bills and now two kids, this was a very difficult time for us. i was working as a professional office type, but also picked up a paper route for extra cash. i was getting up every morning at 3 am. running the route, then going to work all day for 8-10 hours. i needed a day off from the route, and you have to find your own coverage. i took to craigslist (i know). kid (like 19 i think) agrees to meet me. we drive the route, i give him the instructions, directions and pay him $20 up front. we agree i'll pay the rest when it's done. he shares with me he's getting a new job (a place i worked before in an administrative capacity, and i still have lots of connections there). he no shows. i get myself in there and get it done. call him 1000 times. no answer. well i have his name. call my friends at the new job and explain what an ass he is. guess what? he's fired before he even hits training. i find out a year later he was arrested for raping an underaged girl. lots of luck in life scumbag.hey guys, another short story for you all. **the setting:** after finishing basic units in community college, i had transferred to a 4-year university.my family had fallen on hard times, so i had taken up a part-time job to supplement my financial aid. the job was at a cell-phone kiosk located inside of a virtually empty k-mart. it was minimum wage, but it was all i could get at the time. **the target:** $douchebagdan, a regional manager of the kiosk company. this retard considered himself to be the next steve jobs, yet had absolutely zero practical experience in sales or marketing. he wasn't directly abusive, however he made a point of promoting the two douchiest people in the company and assigning them to make everybody else's life a living hell. **the reason:** i could spend hours writing about my time at the kiosk, but ill spare you the boring stuff. let's just say that it got to the point where i carried a pocket-recorder and installed a call-recorder app on my blackberry. even the kmart manager had submitted formal complaints about the attitudes and actions of my immediate superiors. **the last straw** i took a much needed 5-day vacation to go home and visit family. i sat in traffic, 4 members of my immediate family cramped in my small car. my phone rings, and i answer with my bluetooth speaker. &gt;viper: hello? &gt;$manager: what the f***********************************. a few minutes went by with my manager berating me for taking a 5-day vacation; even though he had approved it. i finally hung up on him. my family was mortified. for the first time in my entire life, i saw my grandmother without a smile on her face. i dialed $douchebagdan. &gt;$douchebagdan: hello? &gt;viper: hi $douchebagdan, i need to report abuse from my manager again. &gt;$d: why? &gt;viper: he just called me and berated me for taking a vacation that he had approved. &gt;$douchebagdan: where did you go? &gt;viper: i dont see how that matters. &gt;$douchebagdan: it does, tell me. &gt;viper: i went home to visit my family. &gt;$douchebagdan: for how long? &gt;viper: 5 days &gt;$douchebagdan: you what? &gt;viper: he approved it a month ago. &gt;$douchebagdan: you need to return to the store now. &gt;viper: i'm like 400 miles away. &gt;$douchebagdan: i don't give a f***! you can't take 5 day vacations! the conversation continued to this effect. i could almost see the steam coming out of my grandmother's ears. finally, i ended the call. i was done dealing with it. i drove back to my parents house and pulled out my laptop. i packaged up all of the recordings into a .zip file and called up the company hr. i filed my report and sent off the recordings. the following monday, i woke up to my alarm at 8am. i hadn't heard back from hr yet, so i called them and asked for an update. "it's under investigation" was the answer. i told the hr rep that i wasn't comfortable going to work. i gave them my formal resignation without notice and hung up. a few hours later, i got a call from hr again. they told me they were putting me on "paid leave", and would be in contact soon. another week passed, and i was invited to lunch with the hr manager. **the resolution:** $douchebagdan was fired on the spot. the management under him were heavily audited, and 3 of the 4 were also fired. the audit revealed that one of the managers was committing fraud by creating fake accounts, then selling the "sold" phones on craigslist. further investigation revealed that $douchebagdan was also in on the deal, fudging the numbers wherever he could. both were convicted. $manager was found to have a permanent record of physical violence, one that $douchebagdan had hidden from the hr team; he fell back on drugs and eventually skipped town. i got my job back, and was given the title of "manager" for the few short months that i stayed with the company. **the revenge:** about a year after the incident, i was on linkedin and saw a "people you may know" recommendation. it was $douchebagdan. i checked his profile and was surprised to find that he had found a job as a regional manager for a fairly sizable electronics retailer. that was at least, until somebody sent an anonymous "tip" to his new employer. suddenly, he didn't seem to be employed there anymore. original link to my story here: so it's been 3 months now. found out through email notification she was released back on parole, but in the same state she committed the original crime in. whatevs i thought, my small work of revenge got her 6 months. job well done. well, about a month after her release i received another email notifying me of her fugitive status. she ran again. well, there's only one way for her to make money so i searched some sex ads in the area. and whaddya know? there she is again. knowing her addiction to social media, a few clicks of the mouse and bam...guess what i found? within 3 weeks of getting out of prison, she ran back to her home state and married some guy she was seeing for a couple months before i turned her in. seriously? she accomplished what she tried to do to me so effortlessly. no doubt she did it to change her last name and to have a base of operations with a man that will put a roof over her head no questions asked. from what i can tell this guy has been single a long time, and suddenly this hottie that's madly in love with him wants to get married. no red flags there of course... well, from his profile he had to go on a work trip or something, and within 4 days....four days after getting married she was posting ads all over the state and traveling to meet clients. not going to sit by and watch this dude get deceived and her to get through life scott-free through deception and lying....so i contacted him, told the full story, turns out he didn't even know her real last name. i suggested he turn her in, but instead he just confronted her. she played the victim up until she bailed and ran out the door. he thanked me after that event. hopefully this is grounds for an annulment? not so much pro revenge, i'll agree with that. maybe slightly stalkerish on my part...maybe. but it's not hard these days with the wealth of information people put online for a simple google search to infer what somebody is doing with their life, especially if they don't try to hide it. leave the poor girl alone? fuck no, she's a sociopath and a fugitive and will continue to con men until she lands a millionaire. honestly, people like her are almost worse than sex offenders, at least they get put on a list. granted, is it their own fault guys like him get taken advantage of? hell no, until you meet a sociopath, you have no idea of what deceptions they are capable of, especially when it's a women that uses her sexual nature. people like her continue to roam free, wrecking peoples hearts, wasting their time, and taking their money. if i could i'd make this bitch famous. edit: well here we are 4 months later... looks she deleted all her personal information off the web, and used burner phones for a bit while she continued to escort for a month or so after her husband was notified. decided to check up on the situation today. turns out 1 month ago she has made a reemergence online and the husband has taken her back. looks like he involved her family somehow because now everyone is friends on facebook, he didn't even know her parents when they married. i guess this is where the story ends. crazy sociopath gets away with screwing men over for years into false relationships, has a couple kids, abandons them to their fathers, then marries a guy that took her back after she decided to go hooking for a few months during their marriage (still a fugitive too). whatever story she concocted to convince him to keep her, well good for them. just goes to show in this world, a pretty girl can do no wrong. there will always be nice guys to pick them up when they fall.i was on a business trip to a client in philly, located just far enough away from the city to be a very expensive cab ride, but not so far as to warrant a rental car. i flew down, got an airport cab there, was there for a week being picked up and delivered from my hotel by taxi, and on friday the client called a cab for me to return to the airport. the driver of my cab was distracted and not driving with safe attention to the road, so after a couple miles he hit another car. fortunately it was a low-speed collision, just barely not fast enough to deploy air bags, and everyone walked away unharmed. however, i had to wait for the cops to show up to give a statement, and i insisted the cab company send another car with another driver to take me to the airport. a couple minutes into waiting i realized the driver had left the meter running, which i insisted he stop. all told i was there maybe an hour between waiting for the cop, talking to the cop, convincing the cop not to force me to go to the hospital (i had a black eye before the accident and the cop was really worried that i was terribly injured and too delusional to realize i had been hurt), and waiting for a new cab to show up. so, while i'd left early for my flight, by the time i got to the airport i was going to have to rush to make it. you'd think if you had a cab company and your driver had a car accident with a passenger in the car, you'd see to it that they got to their destination safely and hope they don't sue you, but not only did the second cabbie run the meter and ask me to pay, but he told me the owner of the cab company had insisted he get the fare from the first cab's meter and insist i pay it too. he had the decency to look ashamed about all this, so i wasn't too nasty to him personally, i told him calmly that i recognized that the law allowed that i could be charged for the trip although good business practice would dictate otherwise, but that if i hadn't been charged i would have given him a good tip, while now he'd get no tip as i was offended. and then i told him what to tell his boss i was going to do... you see, my client there was a major bank... it wasn't bank of america, but a few years later it got bought by bank of america, so you can think of it as being that size. and, they had people in to consult with them and work with them often, and they always used this cab company for all the local travel. i would be going back there in two weeks, so i simply phoned up my client on monday morning to let them know about the accident and asked them very nicely to please find another cab company for me to use when i would be there. my contact at the client was, of course, horrified, and made sure that they, their employees, and their consultants and contractors would never be using that cab company again.obligatory not my story, my dad's. the year is 1986, my dad goes to a well known college with a large student body. as such, the dorms are all ten stories high. on floor nine of one such building lives a certain asshole. we'll call him douchebag, or db for short. db lives in the same dorm as my dad, and has a window directly over the entrance to the dorm. being the asshole that he is, db keeps a bucket of water balloons. and every day when students got out of class, db would throw water balloons at the people entering the dorm below him. this did not sit well for a lot of people, but db generally didn't target people who he thought could beat him up. however, 9 stories up it's easy to get away with a lot of things. he'd get individuals walking alone, or groups of small girls, people carrying books, etc. one day my dad just happened to be one of those people. db drops a water balloon, missing him but still landing on the pavement and splattering all over him. dad looks up, sees db laugh and close the window. ohhh, this asshole's gonna get it. what db doesn't know is that my dad was a huge prankster in high school. there are plenty of things i'd love to tell this subreddit, but a lot of them wouldn't count as "revenge." so dad gets his friends together and they formulate a plan. see, one of his friends knows the kid who lives in a dorm on floor 10. directly above db. late in the night, they haul a huge garbage can up the stairwell all ten flights, fill it to the brim with water and set it in the friend's room. the next afternoon, class lets out and they sprint back to the dorms and lie in wait. sure enough, db leans out of his window, ready to strike. and that's when the water hits him. 55 gallons of pure glory rained down from above, with enough force to (almost) drag him out the window. and it just kept coming. call it what you want. a cascade of karma. a shower of revenge. a baptism of stupid. needless to say, the water balloons stopped after that. edited because they filled it after they brought it up 10 stories.this happened last spring. it was for a final project in my sophomore year of high school. i joined a group for a total of four, including two good friends. however, we all just assumed someone knew the last guy, none of us knew quite how this indian kid named dan got into our group. whatever, dan was a smart guy from what we knew. we planned a study session at panera bread the following saturday. group text. everyone confirms they will attend. even dan. of course, dan doesn't show up. no biggie right? we bust our asses on the script and decide to let him get away with just writing the analysis of our script. dan once again agrees. the next week we were going to film the project at my house. now it is important to note here that due to poor planning on our part, we had only two more days until the final was due and we hadn't even filmed yet. we instruct dan to bring the analysis of the script with him to my house when we film. but guess what: he hasn't done the analysis like we told him to. he tells us he can write it while we film, but that wasn't the deal, we need everyone in our group to film for full credit. so dan says he will come film with us than write the analysis. but doesn't show up. what the fuck dan? we missed off season practice to accommodate *you* and you don't show up!? at this point, we realize he is just dead weight. but we were mad. we wanted revenge. we realized we had been instructed to pick our own groups. technically, *the teacher had no idea who was paired with who*. so, we compiled all of our group texts (including some where this guy referred to us white guys using the n-word) and printed them off. then we shot the film sans dan and i gleefully wrote the analysis solo. the next day (the day before its due) dan is texting us like mad trying to get us to film with him. but oops. sorry dan, we only took one day off practice to meet with you and that was yesterday. we finish practice. i tell dan (who had already been waiting 3 hours at this point) that we had already shot the day before. he sends a flurry of angry texts demanding that we shoot the entire project over again, to which we all reply no. come the day of the project, we had already emailed the analysis, video, and script to the teacher. we show her screenshots where dan has clearly neglected his responsibilities and refereed to us with the n-word. dan is called to speak with her privately right before we present and is not in the class for the rest of the period. we later found out he had received a warning for his use of language with us but, even better, dan received an f on his project and his grade dropped two letters. it was glorious, and nobody ever worked with him on a project for the rest of the year in any class. he did learn his lesson, but not before getting the lowest passing grade in the class that year. edit: unnecessary boldinghello all! this is gonna be a long one just warning you now. this happened about a year ago now in october of 2014, i had just split with my ex-wife and was moving into my own place with a friend of mine we'll call him....dickbag or db for short, db had just split up with his girlfriend of almost 15 years, we decided to move in together as we were good friends and had known each other a couple years. upon moving day, i moved all my things into my room aside from my desktop which i put downstairs and setup attached to my desk [with locks]. my laptop which was worth quite a bit, was stored in a storage compartment in my closet that he didn't know about as i chose that room specifically for this purpose. things were going well for the first week....then my wii disappears, ended up finding it at his exs place as he had taken it over for his kids without asking me, i unhooked it and took it back told him if they wanted to play it they can come over to our place, same with my ps3. a few days after that i find him snorting coke and pills and lock up my stuff even harder not wanting him to sell it off but low and behold he somehow finds my laptop and pawns it for cash, i called the cops they said there was no proof so i went pawn shop hunting and found it but they wouldn't let me see it as it had already been sold even though i argued tooth and nail it was stolen property and i would sue unless they let me try to access it as the hard drive was busted and i knew that within that short time span they couldn't have replaced it, ended up not getting the laptop back as they had a signed paper with a false name on it and gave him $1300.00 cash for it. man i was fucking livid at that point. onto the next part, i confronted him about it told him to get my laptop back or get the fuck out of my apartment cause i was the only one paying for bills and food, he called my bluff and didn't leave. so i packed up my stuff, called the cops on him snorting drugs and gave them full access to enter the home and left. last i heard he's living under a bridge after posting bail somehow for all the drugs they found and his kids don't even want to see him, nice knowing you dickbag, hope you have fun living on scraps the rest of your life. tl;dr guy stole my expensive gaming laptop, he got caught, i called the cops and moved out, he got evicted cause he couldn't pay and the landlord took his stuff after 30 days as is the agreement when he didn't move out edit: forgot to mention he took my brand new car out for joyrides when i was working and it's not hard to spot driving around town as i'm the only one with one ^this may not quite be a revenge story as there was no sole perpetrator whom was targeted. rather that i simply got tired of being awoken at 6:00am. either way, i couldn't find an appropriate sub to put this in, so here we are. during my college years, i lived in a small town that had two main landmarks: the university i attended, and a latter day saints training camp/church. the town's residents consisted entirely of college frat boys, retirees, and lds. for the most part, it's a very nice town to live in, i wouldn't hesitate one moment to move back, but there were a few small things that bugged me. the most notable of these was that my condo was only a block away from the lds church, which meant that roughly twice a week, my doorbell would go off at about 6am. now i am not a racist or religionist, however i am a sleepist - anybody who wakes me up unnecessarily is bound to find that out very quickly. sadly, this chain continued through my first semester of college. being that i was working a full-time job while attending full-time college, i had very little time to spare. getting more than 4 hours of sleep in a night was my version of sleeping in. so you can understand that the doorbells at 6am quickly became an unacceptable nuscience. it was time to put a stop to this nonsense. at first i posted signs. nobody read them. i disabled the doorbell. they knocked. i put up two signs. they still ignored them. i photoshopped satanist paraphanalia and pasted it up on the windows at the front of the house. that only fueld them more to "show us the light" i parked my car to block the pathway to the house. they climbed over the bushes. i called and filed complaints with the church. my words were ignored. finally, i'd had enough. i pulled my roommate into a meeting and we plotted. we plotted real hard. tuesday morning, we were prepared, and like clockwork, only a few minutes after 6am, there was a knock on the door. i opened the door shirtless. i had blood all over me, and was carrying a knife and the leg of a boar that my roomate had recently shot on a hunting trip. the lds boys were shocked, but were determined to talk to us, so i invited them in. they walked into our living room, we had our satanist paraphernalia plastered to the walls, and even had a fake human skull hanging from the ceiling fan. on the television, we were playing a hard-core porno with the speakers turned up quite loudly. the boy's sat, and i offered them some glasses of vodka. they declined. i took two shots. &gt;viper: so what i can i do for you two? &gt;lds: we are here to talk to you about jesus &gt;viper: who? &gt;lds: our savior jesus. &gt;viper: i'm not good at spanish, but i think you are pronouncing it wrong. &gt;lds: jesus, the son of god! &gt;viper: oh! i see. hold on, let me get my husband, hes fascinated about this kind of thing. important note: i am a straight male. i stand up and walk down the hall to the bathroom, where my roomate is currently hiding. &gt;viper: dear! the boys want to talk to you &gt;roomate: right now? &gt;viper: yeah, they want to talk about jeezes &gt;roomate: cant i finish? &gt;viper: i dont want them to be waiting. &gt;roomate: fine... the bathroom door opens, and my roomate steps out. he is completely nude, except for shaving cream covering one-half of his nether-regions. the effect was that he was half-way through. he steps out into the living room, and with a voice that would make richard simmons seem straight says: &gt;roomate: oh haiiiiiiiii the look of shock on the boy's faces was priceless. &gt;lds: um, we can come back if you guys are... &gt;roomate: nonsense! tell me about this cheesus &gt;lds: uh.. okay... roughly an hour went by, my nude roomate interrogating the boys as i continued to slaughter/clean a boar on the kitchen table while intently watching the boys make nevous glances at the skull, porno, and the door. finally, we let them go and cleaned ourselves up. we had to steam-clean the floor later to get the blood-stains out, but it was totally worth it. we had 2 whole years of uninterrupted sleep. update: 1. the mod's contacted me asking me to show some proof, and the information that i have provided them seems to have been satisfactory. if you think this was made up, then you are a minority. 2. there has been some argument over the timing of the lds boys. not all doorbell rings were at 6am on the dot, however since our apartment was so close to the church, we were always some of the first in line. generally speaking, the knocks were tuesdays/thursdays between 6-7am. so, let me start this story by saying that i am a cyclist. i transit to work via bicycle because generally it seems to be the fastest and cheapest way for me to get to work. i have also just moved, and have just realized that busses to my new area stop running after 6pm. so you know, now more than ever it is the most efficient means of travel. given that i haven't moved far my route to work hasn't changed very much. i take a slightly different route but ultimately it all connects to the same road i have taken countless times before without issue. today i am riding along said road and i come up to a bus stop full of bogan teenagers (couldn't be older than 13) blocking the shared bike/pedestrian path. i'm not an ass, so i slow down and gradually make my way through them. while i'm doing this one of the teens who was spraying deoderant on himself decides hes going to be funny and spray deoderant in my face. i stop. i get off my bike and walk towards him asking him what the fuck he thinks hes doing. he thinks i'm going to hit him (and i don't blame him for thinking that) and takes off. sprints around the corner. since i have left for work early i figure i have enough time to confront this kid a little bit more and get on my bicycle and chase after him. i couldn't see him anywhere. this old couple was walking along and i ask them "did you see a little turd run by here?", they respond that he went in the alley way. so i pursue him, he sees me and begins running again. at this point while i'm cycling after him i want him to realize that i'm not just your run of the mill responder, that he has messed with a crazy woman. so i start yelling at him the craziest stuff i can think of at the time. *keep running turkey* *i'm gonna get you!* *i'm going to make you my bitch!* over and over with a couple of "fucking" variations here and there. i chase him around the block a few times, past the old couple, past a man in a suit who saw the whole thing. his friends are laughing at him, the guy in the suit is laughing at him, the old couple just seems confused. eventually he is puffed out, even though he can dodge me easily since he is on foot, i have more energy than him (again, i cycle to work every day). he's puffed out and says him: maam him: maam, i'm sorry. him: all i did was spray deoderant on you me: you know that is called assault mate. me: you sprayed it in my fooken face (for some reason i said fucking this way) me: if it was anyone else, you might be lucky to be standing him: well i'm sorry, can we hug, can we shake hands? me: i don't really want to mate. at this point i deliberate as to what exactly i am going to do. should i accept and let him go? or should i humiliate him more in front of his friends who are now watching our exchange. i was a teen once, i know what teens respond to better. so i took his hat. i cycled around the corner out of sight (to where this originally happened) and put it in the bin next to the bus stop. i ride past the man who has taken his suit jacket off (since it is damn hot) and he asks me: *did you get him*? i respond *i got his hat* i ride off into the... sunrise? get to work and have a shower. moral of the story is, don't fuck with cyclists on a shared pathway. we aren't cars, we aren't in heavy traffic that will keep us moving away from you, we can stop and we can turn around. backstory: my baseball team in high school was a co-op with another local high school, so every day the baseball guys from our school would get on a bus after school and ride to the co-op school for practice. to combat my thirst at practice, every day before school i would fill my [gatorade squirt bottle]( with powdered gatorade mix. then, shortly before getting on the bus for practice after school, i would fill my bottle from the water fountain to have cold gatorade for practice. for a few days on the bus during my senior year, we would get to the co-op school and all of my gatorade would be gone from the bottle. you see, some of my friends and i would be sitting in the seats facing the aisles so we could talk, so my back was to my bag and my other stuff and i wouldn't be paying attention to it. one of the guys would sneak under the seats to where i was sitting, take my bottle, sneak back to his seat, drink it all with one of his friends, sneak back to my seat and put the bottle back without me noticing. i acknowledge this was partially my fault for not paying attention to my stuff, but at the same time i was from a small school and knew all the guys on the team, and therefore didn't think i should have to worry about my teammates stealing my drink every day. after the third day of it happening or so, i decided that was the final straw. we boarded the bus the next day and all was normal... or so they thought. i placed my stuff in the seat and intentionally faced the aisle of the bus, waiting in giggly and gleeful anticipation for the bait to be taken. about 10 minutes into the drive, i took a chance and sneaked a peek behind into my seat... and my bottle was gone. shortly after, i heard from the front of the bus, "what, what's wrong man?" i looked up to see one of my teammates, john, look over his seat and angrily look at me with my bottle in his hand. "**what did you put in here?!**" unable to resist any longer, i busted out laughing and revealed to the entire bus full of my teammates as loudly as i could: "**you just drank my piss!!! bahahahahaha**" prior to the bus ride that day, i didn't put gatorade mix in the bottle, and instead took a pee into the bottle before boarding the bus. after i peed into my own water bottle, i filled the rest of it with water from the fountain to 1. mask the warmth of my pee and 2. fill the remainder of the bottle as to not make the perpetrator suspicious. shortly after discovering that he had just drank my kidney kool-aid, john momentarily freaked out, ran back to my seat, and started punching my shoulder while i rolled with uncontrollable laughter. to this day, i have never had any sweeter revenge on anyone in my entire life. tl;dr john stole my gatorade, so i made him some of my special urinade.so my street is kind of a main thoroughfare for students from the local high school. it more or less takes them directly from campus to most of the fast food restaurants. because of this there is always tons of litter and kids doing stupid shit. more times than i can count i've looked out the window to find mcdicks bags or drinks or sometimes entire pizza boxes thrown into someone's driveway. so shortly after school starts for the season i'm already sick of this shit. next time someone litters i'm gonna rub their god damn nose in it. not helping my mood is the fact that, not even half a block away, there is a garbage can. the shaming part 1 it's laundry day. i'm in shorts and bare feet, nothing else (i'm a 23-year-old dude tho). this wild herd of students all bearing items of litter walks in front of the house, and i'm watching them discretely out the window. i'm thinking, okay, maybe one of them will drop a cup and i'll tell him to pick it up. even better. i get the holy grail. some fat kid whips a full drink right at the garage door and runs quite sadly a few feet down the block. i've got him in my sights, i rip the door open and tear after him. i call out "hey fatass are you kidding me" and all of his friends turn around, but he pretends not to hear. his friends just stand there, white as sheets, as i grab the fatty by his collar and toss him to the ground. i yell "you wanna throw shit at my house!?" and he starts blurting out "i'm sorry i'm sorry someone paid me to do it," with this terrified look on his face. this kid is a minor and i could probably already get in shit. i let it slide, tell him to smarten the fuck up and go back in. they all continued on without a word. the shaming part 2 fast forward about a week (so, today). our pumpkins are still on the steps from halloween. not even near the sidewalk, mind you, but all the way up in front of the door. the usual lunch rush comes and i'm reading a book on the couch in my shorts (laundry day again). my girlfriend hears this scream from outside and i slowly walk over and watch these two teenage girls kicking our smashed pumpkins down the street about a house over. now, i don't know if they did it, or if they're just kicking the pieces, but my girlfriend says "i thought i saw someone's head in front of the window," and she goes out there and watches them. as she steps out, this construction guy in his dump truck pulls up and says "it was the girl in the pink sweater. i think her name is ashley." fuck yeah construction guy. so we jump in the car and pull out of the driveway. it should be noted that at this point, this rude douche canoe student with an ugly mustache just guns it around me in a sunfire. remember this guy. so we catch up to the girls, pull into a driveway and my girlfriend (who is pregnant btw) fucking chews them right out. asks them why the fuck they felt like doing that, told them how hard we worked on them, etc. they apologize, look like they're on the brink of tears and shaking. couldn't be older than 15. gf asks what we should do, i say "they seem sorry, i think we should just let them go." but that's not good enough for my girl. she tells them "if you don't clean it up i'm coming with you to the school and we're gonna tell your parents." they definitely don't want that and she marches them all the way back to our place. ten minutes later they're covered in pumpkin and the mess is clean. construction guy is still there and he gives me "the nod". then guess who shows up? mustache douche in his dirty ass car. asks them if they want a ride and they start getting in. they mention how dirty they are and my girlfriend, being the considerate person she is, asks if they want some napkins to clean up. at this point we are being way nicer than we should, but whatever. they decline and tear off down the street. now i'm standing there with my girl and i'm like, "this is when he rolls down the window and screams something." well, he rolled down the window, but he flipped the bird instead. you just had to fucking do it, didn't you? we were gonna let this go. not anymore. so i start sprinting my ass down the street (not shirtless this time, i have a jacket and shoes on). i lose him after a couple blocks but by the time i get to the corner he's actually dropped the girls off and he's coming back. yes. my girl is in the car, she caught up to me. i see mustache across the street slowing to a stop sign and i run over there yelling "heeeeey buddyyyyy". his face goes pale and he just guns it through the stop sign. girlfriend turns, i jump in and we fly after him. he stops further ahead and motions us forward, so i get out and walk towards him. he fucking starts driving off again. what is with this coward? won't talk to me unless i'm in a car? is this what our culture has come to? can't face me unless you're in your bubble? some time around here he makes like he's going to swerve right into my girl and smash the car. fuck that pissed me off. i run at him and he's just saying "you're a goof fuck you" etc and i just told him to be a man and step out of the car. which he didn't do, obviously. so he tears off again, circles around, comes back and sees us and then turns down a side street. so we follow him and end up back at the school. immediately he runs out and calls over a teacher, crying about how i'm "harassing" him. so i politely tell the teacher how him and his friends vandalized my property, made obscene gestures, and threatened my (pregnant) girlfriend with vehicular assault. best part is, we caught a lot of this on camera thanks to my dear girl. so she goes in and shows it to the principal who requests we email him all of the evidence we have. so we did, went home, laughed it off and finished the laundry. and we have an embarrassing video of them cleaning up pumpkin and being cowards. update: as i was writing this, mustache douche actually came back to the house with some people in the car and scoped the house out, pointing and talking. he circled the block and came back again. we have informed the authorities, but i'll keep you guys updated. edit for clarification: i'm gonna address some complaints people have: i did not drag my girlfriend along for the ride. i actually ran after the mustache kid on foot, leaving her at home. it was entirely her own prerogative to catch up in the car. she is not my slave, i am not her master, she has her own free will and can think for herself, thank you. as for the "car chase", it really wasn't. he ran a stop sign before i got into the car. we drove about 20-30 km/h, very casually down the street after him to the next stop sign. i got out again, he did that swervy shit at our stopped car and took off. i turned around and sat in a driveway. we saw him come back and very slowly drove after him around the block and to the school. the whole trip was probably about three blocks going half the speed limit. so aside from his actions with the stop sign and the swerving, there was no danger. also, these "kids" as i say are at least 16 years old, possibly older (17/18). i am 23. there is not that much of a difference between us. when you are 16 and commit a crime, you can be charged as an adult. therefore, i do not consider them minors. furthermore, i did not actually injure or hurt anyone. yes, i tossed the fat kid. he made a violent action towards my home, so i did something about it. i wouldn't go further than a shove. i could have punched him, choked him out, stomped him. but i didn't, because i didn't want to. i dunno about you guys, but in my town, when someone flips the bird, it's a sort of challenge. i called him out, i chased him down. i was willing to engage in some good ol' fisticuffs if that's what he wanted. but he very clearly didn't want that, and i wouldn't have done anything to him unless he threw the first punch. i was honestly just thinking about kicking the mirror off his car (eye for an eye so to speak). until he made like he was gonna hit my girl. that deserves at least a bit of justice, don't you think? update 2: nothing yet, guys. he's been around the block a couple of times but i think he got the hint. i'll post a follow-up if anything happens. still waiting to hear back from the principal of the highschool too. ------- tl;dr fat kid throws litter gets thrown in return like the trash he is, girls smash our pumpkins and have to clean it up on camera, then their friends flip the bird, try to smash our vehicle, pull bitch and cry to the school and get reported to the police.hi everyone, this is my first post on this sub. i wasn't sure whether to put it in pettyrevenge or here since the effort was pretty petty but the results were pro. this story takes place on my families farm. it's a small hobby farm we bought about 10 years ago and has two lots cut off the front corners which were sold to two older couples before we bought it. they were both very nice and there was lots of space and privacy so life was good. on the farm we have four dogs, but the two who will be the stars of this story are two [maremma's]( whose job it is to protect the farm and the animals from a very large pack of coyotes who roam the area. they do this by going to the edges of the property and making a lot of noise to discourage the pack from even coming towards the farm. about a year ago the proverbial shit hit the fan. one of the couples moved into a retirement home and left the house to their son and his wife, unfortunately these two were the classic definition of city slickers. they jumped at every cricket chirp and frog ribbit and we're especially upset when they learnt it was a 20 minute drive to the grocery store. they also brought a very small chihuahua and a very fat cat with them. a couple of nights after the couple had moved in we got a phone call complaining about the dogs, that they were barking at the couple and threatening their cat. this was strange behavior for the dogs so we apologized, and brought them to meet the couple so the dogs would recognize them as friends. while we were there we found out that they had been letting their cat roam outside at night, we told them that was a bad idea and probably bringing the coyotes in closer and forcing our dogs to come deal with the threat. a few hours later we went home thinking everything had been taken care of. we were wrong. we continued to get phone calls complaining about the dogs on a daily basis and since you can only repeat yourself so many times we eventually gave up on trying to reason with them and started locking the dogs inside through the day as well as ignoring their phone calls. since we weren't responding anymore they called animal control, who having met our dogs on numerous occasions, told them they were being ridiculous. after about a month of daily calls to us and animal control we got a call saying that they had bought a gun and if our dogs came near their property again they would shoot them. this was not something we wanted to risk so we immediately went out and installed an invisible fence around the property closest to the house and barns that absolutely had to be protected, this left almost a kilometer of land between the dogs and the couple and made sure they would not be protected (harassed) by the dogs any more. about a week later we found out that their cat had been killed and eaten by coyotes almost immediately after the fence had gone up and a month after that they sold the house and moved. i was more than happy to see them go but i do feel sorry for the cat. edit: tl;dr dogs protect farm from coyotes, city slickers move in with fat cat, threaten dogs, dogs get fenced in, cat gets eaten by coyotes, neighbors move awaythis story takes us back to september. now i'm a nice guy. a very nice guy. i tell people my phone is always on, and i usually get at least one or two calls a week for emergencies. one of my friends proceeded to call me at around midnight for a ride from the bar. her friends left without her and she was stranded. while i'm waiting for her in the parking lot, i am introduced to microdick mcgee in an unpleasant way. i see this guy walk out of the bar (wearing a sailor hat) and go into his jacked up truck (raised cab, big ass tires, suspension, and so forth). i name his microdick mcgee due to the (fake) stereotype of big truck means overcompensation and because he's a complete ass. see, he gets into his truck and proceeds to back up into my parked vehicle, on the drivers side.... and then he starts to drive away. what? did he not feel when he smoked my car? anyways, i start to chase after him and take photos of his licence plate and truck so i have his info incase he gets away. he sees the flash and pulls over three blocks later. i get his info in the form of a business card... turns out he owns his own construction business. we go our own separate ways. i call him later on a few days later, and he wants me to just go to his friends' repair shop... and he'll pay for it. hell no. i'm going through my insurance, i don't want to get fucked over for these repairs. so i fill out the forms and bring my car in... they take photos, my statement, and that's it. now we skip forward two months... i still haven't had the repair done (i'm going to wait until christmas when i can afford to be out of commission for a few days). i get a call from my insurance... turns out he's denying it ever happened now. so i have to go meet up at the insurance agency with him at the same time, with our vehicles for them to take more photos and measurements. i get a call the day of the meeting... turns out he can't make it. nice of him to cancel an hour before the meeting. ass. i think he's doing this to avoid getting caught. we re schedule for two weeks later... he skips this one again! re schedule for another two weeks.... and he misses it again! the insurance agent and i are complaining about this twat and i get some... nice information. turns out he was driving on a suspended licence. i can only assume from a dui or too many collisions and tickets. ooo. i'm going to use this against him. so i go to the bar, and view the footage at the time he hit me, and 15 minutes before he hit me. remember the sailor hat? yeah. that fucked him over. he's a candle in the night at the bar. too easy to find. i get proof of him backing up into me, and a video of him having a drink. bam. drinking and driving. did i mention my state has a zero tolerance policy? next, i tell the cops to show up to the meeting place...and to wait. so we go to the fourth and final meetup (where if he didn't make it, they'd rule in my favor and fine him). he shows up... they rule in my favor (the paint is still on his car!!). he doesn't even look at me the entire time... and drives away as quick as we're done. bam. pulled over as he drives out.. gets a $800 fine for driving without a licence. i also give them the video footage! oooo. if you didn't have a dui before, you do now. and now... i drove past his business a few days later. still driving his truck, and without a licence. so i call the cops again and laugh on my merry way... and i'm going to call the cops everytime i see his vehicle there. that's a fuck of a fine he's going to get, eventually his vehicle will be seized, and because he can't drive... he's not going to be able to go to his clients (he owns a construction company; he's the only employee, so transportation his entirely dependant on him). can't drive to clients? can't make money. can't pay the multiple fines i'm giving you... your business is going to go under. don't drink and drive, don't deny an accident you're clearly at fault for. i don't know if this belongs here, but i'll give it a go. this is a story about my sister. throughout her entire education, primary and high school, people kept telling her that she would never amount to anything, that she'll never make something out of herself. teachers, students, and even some of her friends. she was told by a teacher that she would never finish high school, and that she would live a hard life. because she was told all of this, she started to believe it, and a result she did what people expected her to do. she skipped class, she didn't try because she was worried about putting herself out there only to be shot down. things changed and she didn't want to be this person anymore. she now has more than 6 years experience with a volunteer ambulance service where she is the second highest ranked worker. she graduated high school near the top of her class. her year 12 artwork was a finalist for an art exhibition. she's three years into her engineering degree when she's getting distinction and high distinction marks. she has two jobs, one an engineering job and the other is a great job that lets her travel for free with an included weekend salary of over $500 on average. her second job requires media coverage, so she's been in the paper quite regularly for promotion. everybody who once told her she was going nowhere in life know has her success printed on their papers. she recently ran into the teacher who said she wouldn't finish high school. this teacher was excited to see her, she came up to her and was asking about her life. my sisters response was "who are you?", and then she walked away. the friends that trashed her are no longer in her life. she hears about them through facebook and some have tried to contact her but she doesn't respond. tl;dr: my sister was told by a lot of teachers, students and friends that she would never get anywhere in life. she proved them wrong.(edit:i realize this post is getting a bit dated.. but many of you asked for an update of the aftermath..so aftermath is at the bottom) i repaired an ipod touch for a girl i met at work. i initially offered to repair it for $40 plus the part which was $25. she offered to make it a flat 70$. later, instead of coming by my house, she arranges to have some guy meet me at a local grocery store a couple blocks away. when they pull up, my friend and i notice she is in the truck but sitting very close to the douchebag driving.(xt cab pickup. f250 i think) this was a bit confusing because i know she is married to a deployed marine from our convos at work. he hands me the ipod through the driver window and i see that this thing is in bad shape. i can't tell if it was a long drop or a throw, but one corner of it is smashed, and the casing was slightly bent. the digitizer was still functional but the shattering made it practically unusable. the next day i spend an hour or so carefully peeling off the screen and broken bits, and complete the repair after trying to straighten out the corner as best i can. i message her to let her know that its done. they arrange a meet, again, not at my house, but at the end of the street. i meet them there, show them the ipod and explain that since the corner was bent, the screen doesn't fit as well as it would and it would be a good idea to let it sit under some weight to make sure its pressed flat. she said it looked great and handed me some money. i assumed the two bills she handed me were a $20 and a $50. it was relatively dark so i waited until i was on my steps to check it. sure enough.. its only two $20's &gt;_&lt; .. needless to say i was annoyed and i messaged her instantly. a day goes by without a reply. so i send another message. she asks if $40 was ok, even after seeing that the part + shipping was 75% of what she gave me. so, just to make sure it is her intent to stiff me, i ask if she means for me to accept 10$ for the repair and she says "i guess". so of course i proceed to tell her to find someone else to fix the other devices we discussed. she decides to call me an ass at that time. her boyfriend takes over the conversation. he threatens to stomp my ass and slips up by stating that i am not to 'talk to [his] lady that way'. amused, i decide to press it and toss a couple jimmy-rustlers his way. he responds predictably with more threats and i can't help but laugh at how tough he is trying to act, likely in a hormone-induced rage meant to both put at ease and impress his married girlfriend. i continue to mess with him for ten or so messages, the last of which are in the 3rd image. (the messages not included show a convo about how shitty of a job i did and it wasn't perfect and he could do better.. interesting, being that he wasn't her first choice) he lobs some more bs to which i reply with more bs, mainly just to piss him off, and the block which i had been anticipating came shortly thereafter. as soon as i was blocked, i knew they couldn't see my posts so i posted all 4 images to fb, which, of course, caused some gasps and laughs. the final image being a screenshot of a message sent to her husband containing a screenshot of his wife's boyfriend's initial threat and slip up. i didn't include his reply out of respect and since it isn't exactly relevant. i can say that he was shocked by the message and thanked me for the info. apparently he knows the guy too. although he trusts her, and has no reason to trust me, a stranger, he was grateful for the info and he would deal with it in his own way. i thanked him for his service and said take care. tl;dr - married woman stiffs repair guy for 30$, then has bf assume the conversation when repair guy calls her on it. repair guy gets his jollies off causing general drama and proceeds to inform her deployed marine husband of her cheating with screenshot. this may be slightly petty but it wasn't ideal material for pettyrevenge, being that it wasn't something lame like flipping the cd in someones optical drive, or changing a label on something etc etc. update: i have not been in contact with any of the parties involved since the incident occurred but i do have news regarding the aftermath. i was browsing one of the local classifieds groups on fb and to my surprise..here is the chick that screwed me outta $30 trying to sell some shit haha. i knew immediately that she had created a new account because i was blocked by her dbag bf. i clicked her name, leading to her new profile which has a creation date of nov 29th. it doesn't say she's married but her last name is still the same.. and whats this? her town of residence is the very town she was moving away from just a short while ago. dbag is apparently her new #1 and she liked his fb page 'dbag's woodworking' lolol so much for 97k a year in-home appliance repair.. bummer.. i was almost sure that was all working out for him. another thing that surprised me was her photo: her head was shaved! she previously had shoulder-length hair. now she kinda resembles the dorky kid from undeclared. so, to bring this all to a close.. the apparent aftermath: she moved away to be with her husband who is in the marine corp (florida), they probably separated as a result of the fiasco i helped unfold, and is now back in town, with dbag no less, who apparently couldn't tolerate $97,000 a year (lul) and instead opts for small time carpentry. shes trying to sell anything and everything on a fb classifieds page including popular board games (as if everyone doesn't already have three of these stashed somewhere) and shes not lookin so hot.. infact.. the picture gives me the impression that shes not really pleased at all. i imagine shes upset that she no longer has the big truck, the motorcyle, the steady income, the husband abroad providing all these things for her.... but in reality.. i feel shitty for potentially being the catalyst for her separation/divorce and ensuing unhappiness but at the same time i don't feel bad. the marine is free and gets to use his paychecks on himself, and surely got his big truck and motorcycle back. i'm not perfect and i've made mistakes and to this day i'm still reaping what i'd sewn years ago. mistakes of this magnitude will teach you one thing.. and it is a fact of life: karma is a frigid bitch... -finmy freshman college year myself and a couple other friends had cars but many of our peers did not. whenever we went out as a group you'd chip in towards gas to whichever car you were riding in. one guy though (~mike) would always change cars at the gas station. it took me awhile to realize the scam. as soon as we'd pull in he'd get out to use the restroom then get in another car for the remainder of the ride. he'd say he already paid the car he just vacated if asked. i never questioned that but it dawned on me that i'd never actually seen mike hand over any cash. i asked my other friends about it later and everyone went through a round of "sonofabitch!" when we realized what he was doing. the next time we went out we picked a destination much farther than usual, ~30 miles away from school. when we stopped for gas, one car did not pull in but parked up the street. the other cars (one he was in) each went to the pumps as far apart from each other as possible. sure enough, he gets out and heads over to the other one. but, we both pulled out and left him there. i have no idea how he got back to school but we saw him the next day. i am pretty sure he never went anywhere with us after that either. **edit:** re: being in /r/pettyrevenge or /r/regularrevenge, i did not know those even existed. i did read the sidebar before posting and thought this fit here - *your story should be about getting back at someone who wronged you in generally an interesting and/or funny way.* the response was coordinated between myself and two other drivers and was in reply to someone's douche behavior we discovered was chronic. i'll add, this was well before everyone had a mobile phone, bag phones were still rare then. if he used a phone it was from a pactel booth dropping in coins. he got back by either being extraordinarily lucky and catching someone in the dorm who he could talk into driving ~30 miles to retrieve him or by hitchhiking back. there was no uber or lyft option and even cabs would have been few out there. my guess is that he hitched back. this happened in northern ca where 2 when miles out of town you are in a long stretch of wilderness until you hit the next town. whatever method he used, the getting back part would have completely sucked. i don't remember much of the aftermath but i was quite likely relieved when i heard or saw that he made it back. but only about this much &gt; &lt; . disclaimer: i honestly think this is more /r/pettyrevenge than /r/prorevenge, but this fits the rules here more than it fits the rules there. i also think it's petty because we didn't have one final *coup de grace* against him. still with me? here's the story: &gt;the year is 1995. there's me, who i'll name kevin o'malley. i don't hide who i am on the internet, but i'm not gonna make this an /r/tifu by doxxing myself and getting banned. there's my wife, who we'll call alice o'malley and my boss who we'll call mark green who she never met. &gt;alice and i worked in seattle for computerstore. i was 20 and we had 2 kids. i was teaching for them - you name it: word, wordperfect, excel, quattro, access, quark, photoshop - basically every single thing that existed at the time. alice was doing inside government sales. we got job offers in dallas at the corporate hq. i would be training at the flagship store down the street and she would be doing major gov't accounts. &gt;because i was young and hadn't finished a university degree, i had trouble getting certification to teach in texas. my manager told mark all about me, but he didn't really pay attention. when i got there, he quickly realised that it wasn't legal for me to teach the public since i didn't have tea certification. he also decided he'd rather have someone else. however, i was well-connected within the company and was friends with people far above him. he tried to drag his feet on my tea certification as my sponsor. i could get it. i had enough college and work experience, but he was trying to force me to quit. &gt;mark goes to a big convention in la for government sales as we sold training to the gov't as well. alice, being in gov't also has to go. the company has gotten rooms for everyone at the same hotel. the first evening i get a call from my wife. &gt;"this guy was trying to touch me on the elevator. he was propositioning me, touching me and cornering me." &gt;"eww, gross!" i say. "well, you're a big girl. tell him to fuck off. knee him in the balls or something." &gt;"i will if i see him again!", she replied. &gt;i thought nothing of it. that was that. &gt;a few hours later i get a call from my wife. she seemed pleased with herself. you could hear her smile beaming through the phone. "kevin!", she excitedly blurted out, "you'll never guess what i did!" &gt;i'm somewhat perplexed as i'm thinking she's won the lottery or something. "uh, what did you do?" &gt;"you know your manager, mark?" &gt;"yes, yes, alice! of course i know mark! he's the bane of our fucking existence! he's threatening our ability to be able to live. fuck that guy! what?!?" &gt;in the most serious tone i had ever heard out of her, she says "mark is the guy who was hitting on me." &gt;i pause and say "ok, so what happened?" &gt;alice says "well, i was at the bar and he comes up to me and i'm sitting there with my nametag having a drink and talking to karen, my co-worker. he comes up and starts touching me, fondling me, touching my ass. i tell him to stop. we're all wearing nametags from the convention, but he wasn't. he looks at mine and says 'o'malley' and starts to pause." &gt;she goes on, "i ask him what his name is. he says 'mark, mark green.' i instantly figure it out. i say to him 'don't you know my husband?' and he looks kind of dejected. 'kevin, kevin o'malley.' and his face turns white as a ghost and he leaves." &gt;i say to her "go tell virginia (the training director) right now. go tell her right now." virginia is a friend of mine because i created and developed the first internet instruction course for us in 1994 and we marketed it to the entire company. it was really successful and part of the reason i had a name for myself in the company. &gt;alice goes and finds virginia. she tells him how he kept touching her and hitting on her and didn't take 'no' for an answer. how he was dragging his feet on my tea certification, how he didn't know who he was hiring and failed to tell us this was even a problem. and virginia calls me and i explain all of this. &gt;virginia is an old-school feminist and the only female executive. older lady. she was not impressed. mark returned early from the conference. my tea certification happened quickly, as in people from up high in the company pulled strings to get it done. &gt;mark wasn't long for our location. our store was the flagship, we had the biggest accounts and it was by far the most prestigious. before he was moved laterally to a different store with no future, my wife used to call me at work and call his direct line to ask for me. she would pick me up at work and come in with our kids. he would close his door every time she was there. every time i asked him for something, i got it. and i made it a point to ask him for stupid shit. all the time. and then he left for the crappy store and eventually left the company for good. the /r/justiceporn element to it was that it really helped my standing in the company, as well as my wife's to bust this guy. we both interfaced with the executives regularly. in the end before he left, i ended up in a regional position above him, but laterally. i suppose the irony was that he was trying to make me quit, but they put him in a position with poor bonus structure and he ended up quitting and they didn't have to pay out the severance package of his contract.don't know if it belongs here, but grievous bodily harm is involved, so maybe? growing up i had a friend we'll call dave. as far as we ever knew, dave was likely the result of a mother who had been doing a number of drugs for most of her pregnancy, as well as heavy drinking. when he was around 4, his mother dumped him and his little brother with his grandmother, and promptly ended up in jail for attempting to rob a bank. his grandmother decided that his younger brother was an angel, and he was somehow evil. dave had issues. doctors said he had all of the signs of antisocial personality disorder at around 12, and ended up being sent to a special school where he basically retracted farther and farther from human interaction... that is, aside from with me. dave was inhumanly smart, liked sports, could play any musical instrument that you handed him within a week, and we had basically everything in common. in spite of what doctors, and his family seemed to think, dave was a totally great person. he was such a good friend, that one time when he came to me and admitted that he had feelings for a girl i was dating, and she admitted to liking him, i immediately gave them both my blessing, and remained friends with him... not her, though. she for some reason was angry that i was not upset that they were happy. that's another story though. dave and i ended up taking martial arts together for years as well. it was an awesome outlet for me, since i was home schooled, and didn't get to meet many people, and him, since he turned out to be amazingly talented at martial arts (i was not shocked by this.) the thing was, as cool a guy as dave was with me, and our tightly packed group of friends, he was in fact a smart-mouthed, sarcastic bastard. he did not like fighting, but more often than not i could assume that if dave was speaking to someone, we were going to end up in a fight. we were 16 year old boys. not too bright all around. so, dave's grandmother has decided one day that she would punish him, since his little brother had broken down the door to dave's room. it was obviously dave's fault for wanting to have privacy, by her logic, and so he was sent to reshingle the roof of his house, (this is apparently a fitting punishment, for wanting privacy.) i found out, and as you do when your buddy needs help, i suddenly found my ass up on a roof with a hammer, pulling off old shingles... and completely terrified of the 2 (i just went and looked a few minutes ago, it's not 3,) story drop on the other side. while i am up on the roof, i hear voices. i slowly, and fearfully walked my way to the edge of the roof. almost straight below me, i see a local dealer (we'll call him fats, everyone else did) is threatening dave. he is threatening him with a bulge in his coat pocket, which no one can see. now, we live in baltimore city. there is about a 30% chance that there is actually a gun in that pocket. i'm trying to decide what to do, when he pulled his hand out, and to my surprise he is holding a cheap, fleamarket style butterfly knife, of the kind you get when you're like 12 and think you're a badass now. well, i can only partly remember what happened at that point. he cut dave, and it was fairly bad. there was instantly blood visible. i then took one giant step off of the roof, with the idea in my head that i would land on this fucker, and kill him. i had completely lost it at the thought that my friend might be dying, and i was totally fine with the idea of going to jail for killing this asshole. good/bad news for me, i did not land on him, and instead hit the ground directly in front of him, doing damage to my knees that i've never really recovered from. good/bad news for him. i did not kill his ass, but when i fell my forearms came directly down on his collar bone, shattering it in a completely horrifying, and magnificent way. how i didn't break my forearm i don't know, but this kid looked like someone had hit him with a wrecking ball. he screamed, and took off right away. i can only assume shock is what kept him awake, because we heard days later that his collar bone had been broken in like 3 places, as had several of the ribs below it, from the impact. dave, as it turns out, had gotten a cut across the forehead, and was otherwise fine. it also turns out that dave was getting ready to hit fats in the face with a claw hammer, when i came falling out of the sky like some tubby, rage-powered meteor. according to him the sun blacked out for a brief moment, a flash of pale white boy descending from the heavens, and then two fat guys on the ground, screaming. he had no fucking clue what happened. he helped me inside, and after a bit we (with all of the expert medical knowledge two 16 year olds can muster) reasoned my legs were not broken. i then limped home, and went to bed, while he went back to working on the roof. we never saw fats again after that. turns out a lot of people did not like him, and when he was suddenly completely unable to defend himself, he thought it was a good idea to leave maryland for good. edit: sorry if this is a bit rambling. a bit drunk, and remembering old friends i haven't seen in years. wanted to share the story with someone. edit 2: added line into story from comments about my pale ass falling from the sky like it was the dawn of the final day. edit 3: doctors said he displayed all of the signs of antisocial personality disorder, not that he had it. sober now, sorry for the misunderstanding. edit 4: finally got off my ass and walked up the street to look. 2 stories from where i jumped, not 3. makes sense in retrospect, since we would have had to place the ladder at the lowest part of the roof. fear and bad memory was definitely making me remember it as being way taller.i met my buddy pat in the early 90’s when i was a sophomore in high school. he was a ‘nam vet, living in a dilapidated old apartment in a crummy small-town on florida’s west coast. the units were pretty run down, with cars, young bare-footed ill-watched children running about, and the various kind of yard detritus one might suspect. i guess he’d taken a shine to me because i was intrigued by him working on various cars, boats, and the fact that he'd sneak my 16 year old self beers, just to have someone to chat with. also, pat was in the midst of a nasty divorce. sometimes these things happen when you decide to cohabitate with a cocktail waitress 20 years your younger, but such is life. she’d taken him for nearly everything (which wasn’t much to begin with), leaving pat almost completely broken hearted. almost...because she left him moose, a white poodle-ish dog of questionable lineage. moose was great, pat would take him to bars, dye him green for st. patrick’s day, and they were always inseparable. if pat was working on a derelict boat while sucking down a parliament and mainlining busch light in the 90 degree heat, moose was right there with him, all day long. about 3 months after the divorce, pat’s ex called, demanding the return of a beloved childhood stuffed animal, a small unicorn. evidently, her father had given it to her, he’d recently passed, and she realized it was the only remaining item she’d forgotten to abscond with. i’m sitting there witnessing the phone conversation, wondering what the hell she’s bitching about, when pat closes the call with “fine you worthless whore, i’m going out of town but will be back in a month, you can collect your fucking unicorn then.” slam. pat looked at me and a devilish smile crossed his crocked teeth. after explaining the call, he leaves the kitchen to fish through some dusty closet boxes and retrieves the plushy unicorn. “moose!” he calls, and moose comes running, per command. eyes wide and tail-wagging, moose sits and awaits master’s command. “moose, here’s your unicorn!” and pat tosses it down to the runt dog, who eyes it for a moment. it may be fair to mention at this point that moose is not neutered. he then proceeds to doggy fuck the ever living hell out of that unicorn like the antidote was lodged somewhere in its fluffy soul. word travels fast in shitty communities and soon “moose, go get your unicorn!” was the favored saying. damn near everyone would pass by and mutter those words, only to have the poodle run inside, get the stuffed love toy, and proceed to befoul that thing like nobody’s business. a month passes and poor unicorn was looking haggard, missing an eye, and all dignity. bitch cocktail waitress finally pulls up one muggy florida day in her chevy celebrity to collect her prized possession. after some unpleasant words exchanged, she demands her unicorn. a small crowd had gathered and pat’s moment had arrived. finally, after losing everything, it was time to mutter the sweetest words of redemption i’d ever previously, or ever will hear again: “moose, go get your unicorn!” roughly 14 years ago, i was a naïve kid and went to a car dealership to buy my first used honda. i had enough money saved for a down payment but the stereotypical used car salesmen upgraded me to another, more expensive car. it had just been traded in earlier that day so it was still in the service shop. i got the service check-off sheet claiming all the work that was done and the main one being "brakes replaced". i take it home and after a few days of adjusting to the new car, i notice that my brakes are squeaking. i call the dealership and they tell me over the phone that honda's do that (made a record of time/date/name of rep). i ask around and sure enough they confirmed what the dealership had told me. over the course of the next 4 months the brake noise upgraded from a squeak to a squeal and by the end of the 4th month, a grinding was heard. i bring it into the dealership and they tell me, "*your brakes are completely worn to the nub! you have maybe 5% left at best. that will be $490 to repair the issue*" i speak to the service manager (sm) who was no help. i find the salesman and anyone else involved with my sale and none of them can help me as the check-list states "**brakes were replaced**" i've never heard of brakes going out in less than 5000 miles. i finally get a hold of the general manager (gm) who flat out tells me, "*son, you're a kid, guys like you race fast and brake hard. i've replaced brakes at 2000 miles before.*" he won't do a thing for me. they replace the brakes but one of them isn't tightened on well and on my way home, the brake pad falls off its housing (its still attached by tangling) and i call a tow truck on the dealerships expensive. i have the guy take the ultra long way back as they bill by the mile. i pick it up the next day and nothing is said about it. i sulk for 6 months telling my story to all that care to hear me. finally a friend of a friend hears me out and is familiar with what to do. he helps me to write a letter to the better business bureau and notify news agencies. i'm to write "help me" articles to newspapers, even call up talk radio stations for advice. i takes several weeks and nearly 60 envelopes later, i had stacks upon stacks of letters going out to various agencies and companies. two months go by and i had gotten a few news agencies that were interested but the big one was the bbb. my case worker (chad) says they will do an investigation and informs me that this isn't the first time said dealership has done this before. mine was the first where detailed records were kept. (i had additional maintenance records going into the same dealership as well as secondary opinions). over a year had gone by since i bought my car and i take it back to this dealership for the last of my scheduled warranty maintenance. before i do so, i go to a bbb trusted mechanic and have him confirm my brakes are good. 9500 miles and nearly brand new still. at the dealership, i avoid everyone that might recognize me and i speak directly to the mechanic. he does the last of the warranty maintenance and i ask him to check my brakes knowing full well that the service manager and gm had written notes about me for future reference (chad warned me of this). he confirms what chad had told me would happen. "*your brakes are almost worn out. you must ride them hard as they were replace about 8 months ago. you should probably get them replaced again.*" i ask the guy to write all this down and he refuses to make it on the official paperwork. but caves on dealership letterhead instead. name/date/time/the works. i fax this information to chad and some time later i get a phone call from the gm of the dealership. i don't remember all of the half hour long conversation but he was attempting to bribe me with free service, vehicle upgrade (with a pay the difference catch), blah blah blah if i would retract the "unfair accusation" i made against him and his store. i was milking him for all it was worth and i finally said, "**you know, being that i drive my car like a typical** *kid,* **i would be thrilled if the dealership replaced my nearly new tires, brakes and oil and transmission fluid. i am** *hard on cars after all* ". he was verbally pissed at my attempt to rub what he said in his face. he hung up claiming i was being unreasonable. i never did get my refund for the brake job i never should have paid for. it took 3 years and several more complaints from other customers but the dealership was forced to close down and sell. chad tells me it was mostly because of my detailed recordkeeping and persistence that led to that dealership going under. **td;dr: dealership sells me a car with bad breaks and lies to cover up their mistake. i call the bbb and the dealership is eventually forced out of business.** *edit1: if the mods want proof this happen, i will gladly give it to them upon request. **done** sorry to have upset a few of the redditors* *edit2: wow thanks to /u/funkyskunk and /u/flclimber , i found out a lot more what actually happened. bbb probably took my evidence, information to the da or attorney general and the manufacturer probably got involved. with enough evidence, they were able to bring down the corrupt dealer or force them to sell.*not me, but my brother a couple years ago. he is a mechanic and tow truck operator in a small town. a while back, he gets a call for a job; a guy wants to buy his son a used pickup truck, but it's in another town and needs some work; the client says it's a lot of work apparently, but it should be a fun dad/son project. he hires my brother to pick it up. my brother gets our there and it's in surprisingly good condition; the big thing is the tires are shot. he tows it to his shop, calls the dad, and explains he actually got a pretty good deal. brother offers to install some new tires and do a little minor work and the truck should be ready to drive. dad happily agrees and gives the work the go ahead. two days later and the truck is running. my brother takes it over to the house and leaves the bill on the seat. five or six days go by with no word from dad, so my brother calls in to ask how the truck's running. "great!" says dad. so my brother asks about expecting payment, dad says he'll be in first thing in the morning. the next morning rolls around, no dad. same thing for a few more days. my brother reaches him again, and now gets a little run around, with dad trying to say the truck's not running so well. dad doesn't really know vehicles, though, so his bluff isn't really working. my brother says he's willing to work on other problems or recommend other mechanics, but he still needs payment for work already delivered. at this point, dad starts mumbling something about how he won't be scammed and hangs up. dad ducks my brother's calls for a week. so, my brother calls the local police to explain what he's going to do, then calls me to ask if i want to see something funny. i say sure, and he picks me up and takes me to this guy's house in the afternoon on a friday. the truck is parked on the street and has been driven recently. a police car pulls up, at which point my brother says hi to them, then starts loading the truck onto his tow truck. after a few minutes of beeping, teenage son comes out of the house, freaking out. he's a brand new driver and thinks he parked wrong or something, but my brother explains that his dad didn't pay. son goes inside to call his dad. my brother loops around the block for a better angle, then backs the truck completely into the driveway. he pulls out, lifts the truck on jacks, removes the tires, them lowers the whole thing onto a couple 2x4s, then puts another bill on the windshield for the time he spent at the house. we all then leave, and my brother closes up his shop before hearing anything. he doesn't hear anything until wednesday next week, and it's a call from *mom*. apparently, dad spent a few days lying to his family saying my brother was trying to scam them, but eventually fessed up. mom was fuming, because her car was blocked in the garage the whole time by the truck! she came down in person and paid my brother cash for everything, plus more to come back and reinstall the tires. the best part, unfortunately, i didn't get to see, but mom made dad apologize to my brother in front of their son when he reinstalled the tires.just discovered this sub and love it. thought it would be a great place to share my story. two years ago i lived in a touristy area of ontario and worked as a server and bartender at a fairly well known canadian restaurant chain. it is no exaggeration to state the front of house manager (foh), assistant manager (assman), and general manager (gm) are among three of the dumbest people i have ever known in my life. my four months working at this place were fucking awful and soul crushing but the tip money was unreal so i could tolerate it. this was essentially the management dynamic: foh was a lazy fuck who projected his own laziness onto the front of house staff. he was prone to giving lectures about how lazy we all were and constantly threatening us with "a stack of resumes" he had in the office. he would also make insanely creepy remarks about female employees (one of whom was my sister so super awesome) and racist comments about customers. assman was essentially the kind of person who never had any power in her life. she then used her new power to make our lives miserable. her first order of business was removing any information about workers' rights from the premises. finally gm was just a manipulative sadistic misogynist who was just straight up abusive to female staff. also, these three people hated each other and made no attempt to hide it. basically by the end of the tourist season i gave no fucks about my job and wanted out. i started a work to rule strike which supremely slowed down operations in hopes of getting fired. fortunately foh decided to stop scheduling me which led to an intense confrontation where he was very sure that i (a fairly physically imposing guy) was going to beat the shit out of him. instead i told him to fuck himself, went home, and read the employment standards act in its entirety. i wrote a lengthy report to the ministry of labour citing at least 16 violations of the employment standards act. for the better part of the next year they were under investigation which resulted in me getting a pay out for termination (constructive dismissal) and them getting a number of fines. the sweetest part being every time i heard from my case worker she spent a good amount of our conversation bitching about how awful the management was to deal with. the last i heard from her, the ministry was still doing regular inspections of this restaurant since they've now been red flagged for shitty labour practices. so satisfying.this post might've turned out a bit too close to something from /r/offmychest, but i hope it's alright. not sure how pro it is either, but i think it's a bit too much for pettyrevenge. so, a little background story. i'm currently in my last year in school, not quite sure what grade it'd be in america, but i'm eighteen right now, so late highschool early college? the year before this wasn't very productive however, and i had very poor attendance and not the best grades. however, in the last months of the year i pulled myself up from the ground, talked to my teachers to see what i needed for a pass and then spend day and night studying and writing to achieve that. now, my history teacher was rather lax about the whole thing, only asking me to hand in one task before summer came and he'd give me a pass. summer came and went, school began anew and we switched systems so that i couldn't see my grades. a month into the semester however, i was called into a meeting with the vice-principal where she explained to me that she had arranged for me to take extra history lessons to make up for my failing grade. this stunned me, and i went straight to my history teacher to ask for an answer. he dismissed me at once, saying that he never got anything and that i hadn't handed it in, despite both emailing it and leaving a printed copy on his desk. i offered to give it to him once more, but he just said "this is just how we're going to do it. you'll have to attend class" that'd be the biggest problem. the extra classes i got put in? scheduled at the same time as four other subjects. now i had to run to those teachers, ask to do stuff at home, beg for them to mark me as present despite me not being so. (as here in sweden you will lose financial support if you go above 10% absence) eventually things have settled down with an extra 2 hours of studying every day to make up for it. when sitting in class and hearing about the antiquity for the fifth time however, i was not only intensely bored, frustrated by the huge waste of time, but also angry at my history teacher. so when he droned on about how ceasar was stopped just short of achieving dictatorial power i took my first stab. "actually, didn't the senate vote him dictator perpetuo? which quite frankly wasn't very far from absolute power?" "mayhaps, i'll have to check that later. anyhow, he was assasinated by a group of senators led by brutus, who we think was his son.." "isn't that considered highly unlikely by historians today? given that ceasar at the time of brutus' birth was merely fifteen?" and on, and on. i'd give him four or five sentences, interrupt him whenever i could add something which he missed or point out something that was wrong, or considered unlikely. i knew he was very apprehensive about dealing out any sort of disciplinary action against me, and i think i went as close to the line as i could, even making him say "no, i think you're wrong. let me look that up real quick" and googling something, before having to admit that i was right. i read ahead in the coursebook, but when that proved to be insufficient i started frequenting askhistorians, listening to the podcast "history of rome" and look things up, especially common misconceptions, before i knew we'd cover them in class. i think i'm driving him mad. he has apparently consulted my mentor, bringing up the subject himself that "maybe he shouldn't miss all those classes to be in mine" but she knows my situation, and assured him that it's fine, and we've got something worked out. he has started to avoid lecturing and started to just hand out an assingment, tell us to check the textbook and google for the answers and then disappear. all i know is that i will continue this, and since i'm learning, i'll get a good grade too! edit: yes, i tried to show him the sent email, however as i mentioned earlier the school switched providers for their online stuff, from a provider called it's learning to vklass. thus i can not access my previous school email.i originally posted this to /r/pettyrevenge but soon realized that this revenge wasn't really petty and was assured of that by some redditors, so i figured i might x-post it here for those who might be interested and/or don't browse /r/pettyrevenge **context** so my 11-year-old little brother was born 2.5 months prematurely and despite the doctors giving him marginal chances of surviving, let alone developing normally in the event that he should survive, he did and is fully functioning, except he lacks in certain areas, such as drawing and crafting. he draws worse than a 5-year-old in kindergarten, but he can't help it. so one day, the teacher in his art class collects all assignments, looks at my brother's work, starts laughing and commenting at it and parading it around the class saying "this is the kind of crap you're not allowed to bring in" and "did you use your toes to draw this or something?" among various other things in front of the whole class. my brother naturally didn't want to attend art class anymore and told my mother about this afterwards and mentioned she's been saying mean shit to him for the entire 3 months he had taken her class, but not as bad until now. **revenge** after having told my mother about this, she was naturally infuriated and went to his school the very next day only to hear the same teacher making rude remarks about other students of hers behind the half-open class door. my mother just stood there for a bit and eventually smiled at the teacher and asked if she could have a word. the teacher was mortified, blushed harder than maybelline, but finally managed to stop stuttering and shaking and came out of the class to meet my mother. just a note: at this point, she had no idea who my mother was or what she wanted, she was just shitting bricks because she knew my mother had heard the how she talked to her students. so they started talking about my little brother and her remarks and once my mother was done explaining his situation regarding shitty artwork, she handed the teacher her business card with a date and time on the back and told her to be sure to show up. oh yeah, i probably forgot to mention that her title on said business card says: "head inspector" of the ~~censored~~ county department of education. the teacher was suspended without pay for 30 days and was made to take some sort of classes on ethics and communication. tl;dr: my little brother who was born prematurely was made fun of by his art teacher since he can't draw well due to being born early, my mother who happens to be the head inspector of the county's department of education confronted her; teacher gets suspended without pay for 30 days and has to take mandatory classes on ethics and communication.this is from /u/joe64x in /r/britishsuccess: some twat in a company van cut up this man who was driving his family around and later verbally assaulted him. unfortunately for this twat, he had a front-mounted dashcam and is a web developer. he bought the company's website and posted the whole story and video there. enjoy! i had a relationship with a girl some time ago, i'm 18 and she was 17. we had sex over the summer, and her parents freaked out when they found out. they threatened to charge me with statutory rape, even though my state's age of consent is 17. our relationship ended, and that was that. a few weeks later she and i began talking again, i found out they took all of her electronics and had started punishing her severely. her school social worker contacted the police when the signs of physical abuse started to surface, but the police did nothing to stop it. she attempted to move in with her grandparents, but it didn't work. she eventually burned down their garage to try to get herself removed from the home, because she felt that anything was better than living with her parents. her parents kicked her out the next day, she got home from school and her belongings were on the front lawn, and her keys no longer worked. i caught wind of this and was furious. it was wrong of her to burn their garage to the ground, but their beating her and such was too far. the day after i find out about all of this, i'm at starbucks with my best friend, and my ex's parents show up. her dad sees me, and asks me to talk to him outside. i'm a pretty scrawny dude, and he's not, so i cautiously agree. we go outside, and he gets so close i can feel his breathe on my face. he starts throwing out words, threatening to kill me, telling me to watch my back, et cetera. i told him to calm down several times and not to cause a scene. eventually he backed off. after this encounter, i was fuming. this guy was threatening my life, was essentially blaming me for his family falling apart because he's a dickhead, and acting just like a total neanderthal. so i decided to get back at him. i called the police and found out what i could do as far as the law, and found that i could attempt to charge him with assault, among other things, but i decided a psychological strike would be much more effective. so i contacted dcfs. i told them everything about what had just happened with their 17 year old daughter, explained the abuse, keeping my own incident out of the matter, and dcfs went in to investigate. they removed the 12 year old daughter from the home as it was deemed unsafe due to the parent's violent tendencies. they are allowed no contact with her for the time being, last i heard their marriage was on the rocks as a result of the stress brought on by loss of their daughter. their middle daughter, who i had relations with, is glad i made the call, as it got her little sister out of a dangerous environment. i felt that making them lose a child and almost destroying their marriage was sufficient revenge for threatening my life. might still get the police involved. well this is a long story - using throwaway account as friends know my reddit name. beginning: i was born in india. when i was 10 i moved to a small country town in australia when my dad got a job here. it sucked. i was small, fat, brown, had an accent and didnt understand the culture. a bunch of racist nutjobs at school bullied me and life sucked. thankfully i kept my grades up and got a scholarship to study science at a major univesity in a major city. during my first day of tutorials at university i notice there is a shy, awkward looking chubby indian girl sitting by herself. her name was rani and she too was from a rural town. she had just moved up here with her second cousins. we quickly bonded over how bad high school was and how nice it was to be in a multicultural city. we ended up having a lot of mutual interests and joined the same societies/clubs at our university (video games, board games, indian cultural clubs, ballroom dancing etc). within a month or so i asked her out (first girl i ever asked) and she said yes. we dated in secret and became each others first everythings (kiss, love, relationship, sexual partner etc). after a year of secret dating she moved into my apartment. life was fantastic. we never fought, had 0 problems, had similar hobbies + friends, constantly attracted to each other, had sex every day etc. it was perfect - just two love birds building a life together. problem: well after dating in secret for 2 years we decided to meet each others families. my parents are conservative muslims but knew i was going to date around. they were just happy i had chosen an indian girl they could relate to. her parents initially were very harsh and aggresive. however, when they met me they immediately fell in love with me. the only problem was they wanted us to get married. rani and i had already talked about this. we both wanted to get into medical school after our bachelors. we both wanted a family and the white picket fence but we had both decided to wait on that until after medical school. however, after meeting her parents and some introspection i decided to speed up the plan. my plan was to ask her for marriage in 2 years time when we'd finished our bachelors. we would get married in the 5 month break after univeristy - do a bit of travel - have a honey moon and then commence medical school as husband and wife. in the meantime i decided i was going to lose all my excess weight and become the attractive groom she deserved. both her and i were fat and we never had any issues with our weight and attractiveness to each other and i didnt care if she remained fat for the rest of our lives. i just wanted to improve myself and make myself the attractive man she deserves to be with. heartbreak: rani was innitially supportive of my weight loss. she liked the new me and how much energy and confidence i know had. after 1 year i had lost 30kgs and hit my ideal bodyweight. i started lifting and was building muscle mass. rani started getting more insecure in herself. i would reassure her that i had no issues with her weight but we started getting into more fights. she was annoyed with how id always cook my meals and i wouldnt eat out with her as much, i spent all this time at the gym etc, i was too attractive for her etc. i would reassure her all the time that this wasnt the case but things kept getting worse. with 1 year to go i let rani's father in on the plan. i asked him for his consent to marry rani on the proviso that we'd get married after graduation so that we wouldnt have to worry about a wedding whilst trying for med school. he said yes and was absolutely excited. with 8 months to go rani started acting really cold and weird. i knew something was up. at first i thought it was the stress of med school entrance exams and coursework etc. 2 weeks into the coldness i opened up her laptop to look up this tenancy agreement thing regarding our appartment. i see a messanger message from this guy that was highly suspicious. rani had this friend that looked and acted like that dumb fat brother from my name is earl. he was absolutely ridiculously socially inept, annoying and very uncultured/ignorant. he was very fat and had bad bo all the time. he was in the board games/video games/anime clubs with us. looking over her skype messages rani had been bitching to earlbro about our relationship for the last year or so. earlbro had confessed his love for her a couple times which rani had knocked back. 2 weeks ago rani and earlbro must have cheated. earlbro wanted rani to break up with me but rani was saying this whole thing was a mistake and to shut up. well i saw red and immediately packed up my shit. i printed the messages out. i tell my landlord that i wont be renewing my lease. i text rani that i know and that we are through. i quickly move most of stuff (i dont have much, most of our stuff was ranis) into my friends house and tell my friends to sheild me from rani. well rani found out and went ballistic. she apparently ran home and saw my stuff gone. she went to our mutual friends house and started balling her eyes out. she tried contacting me but my friends deleted all her messages etc. apparently earlbro was a drunken mistake, she never wanted to hurt me etc, the reason she cheated was because she thought i was getting fit so that i could find a better girlfriend and upgrade from her (wtf?), could i please meet her for another chance/closure ... blah blah. i decided i was never going to talk to her ever again (something which i have successfully achieved). revenge 1: rani's dad started blowing up my phone a day after dumping rani. he aggresively demanded an explanation on why i broke her heart. her 2 older brothers also called and made threats etc. i didnt reply to their voicemails. instead i sent a huge email out to both rani and my parents. in the email i wrote out a heartfelt message explaining how id envisioned rani and i getting married but she had cheated (i copied in the screenshots of her message) and that i apologise for causing a scene and diminishing our families' status (indians care a lot about family status) but that id really like my space so i can concentrate on getting into med school. within 1 hour of sending the email out rani's dad phoned up. he was very apologetic. he said his girl was very sorry and it was a mistake. he said he would drive up and beg at my feet to take rani back and offered me money (wtf?). i accepted his apology but said i dont want any further contact with her or her family and wished them all the best. a week later rani's family drove down to our city. they took rani back to their country town and pulled her out of her courses. she didnt graduate on time and couldnt apply for medical school. she returned 1 year later to complete her course but she failed. she ended up living at home unemployed for a year before going into a retail job. she put on massive weight and now looks like a bloody globe. word got out to the indian community about her cheating and her family was ostrecised. rani is now massively depressed and her family has resented her for bringing down their status in the indian community. revenge 2: i went off to med school in another state. a bunch of indian parents got in contact with me to tutor their kids. one girl i tutored, amina, blew me away. she was studying science and wanted to get into medicine. she was gorgeous both inside and out. she had a beatiful smile and lit up the room. most importantly, she had a beautiful sole. she was active in her community and volunteered a lot not because it would help her get into med school but because she actually cared. after tutoring her for a year i knew i was in love with her. i asked her out but she declined. she said she liked me too but she is religious and only wants an arranged marriage as per islamic law. despite not dating her i knew she was my dream girl so i contacted my parents. my parents and her parents 'arranged' our marriage on the proviso that we would be engaged for 2 years until both she and i graduate our respective programs. during this time we started dating as fiancees (weird i know). years back rani and i had made a bucket list of romantic activities we would do together as a couple. amina found the list. i explained the situation to amina and she said she liked the list and wanted us to complete the activities with some modifications. we aimed to complete the list before our marriage. amina took photos and scrap booked all our memories as we completed them (things like hiking a mountain, salsa dancing, great barrier reef, rome/paris etc). a couple months before our scheduled wedding amina published our scrap book on facebook. somehow rani found access to the scrap book. she sent a scathing message to amina saying she stole her idea. amina messaged back a viscious message saying how terrible rani is, how bad it must be to lose someone like me and that the scrapbook was our idea together before we'd get married. hearing that i was getting married must have pushed rani over the edge and she threatened to take her life. she had to spend 3 weeks at a mental health ward. it was a massive scandal in our indian community. this was 3 years ago. revenge 3: ive been married to amina for 2 years now and things have been perfect. she is now in med school and im a junior doctor. we're trying for a baby now. last sunday my father called. one of my dad's friends from another city was trying to arrange a marriage for his son. rani's parents had contacted him with a proposal. my dad's friend called up my dad to get an idea about rani before they introduced her to his son. my dad forwarded my initiialy email to this guy and then called up and told him rani's story of cheating, dropping out of university, depression etc. needless to say that guy ran for the hills and cancelled the arranged marriage. he was very thankful for my dads advice and said he would warn the other indian people in his state about her history. endnote: so thats that. in the end i didnt even have to talk to rani these past years to get my revenge. all of it was delivered on a silver platter by karma. i have a beautful wife, a job i enjoy whilst all rani got was misery and self-destruction. all this because i wanted to lose weight before i proposed to her. its probably not pro-revenge but i still get a kick out of it and maybe some of you guys who are unlucky with love will find some peace/joy reading this. just passing the karma on. gather around, it's going to be a long post. it's also getting things off my chest finally. okay, so this story sets in india. my gf at that time was in university and living in a house with around 6 other housemates. she was fine with all of them except 1. we'll call her fb. fb was the type of housemate that made sure that my gf's life there was miserable. she'd do something almost every day to upset my gf. sometimes it'd be little things like stealing her food, borrowing her shit without permission and not returning it etc. other times, she purposely chipped off parts from her coffee mug that i got her as a gift, slashed her bike tyres, wouldn't let her and other housemates in at 1am when they was returning from a party and left them stranded outside..etc. you get the picture. the house they were living in was for 'girls' only. guys were allowed but then asked to leave after 12am where sometimes 'random' security checks happen. i say 'random' because they hadn't had a security check in the 1.5 years she had lived there. fb's boyfriend lived with her for a week with no consequences either. so it's no surprise that when i came for a 2 week stay over to the house (from another country because we were long distance), the landlady got a tipoff on the first day and a security check happened where i got kicked out. with nowhere to go at 1am and a kind of remote region, my gf decided to sneak me back in to stay the night and leave in the morning for a hotel. when i climbed up the staircase to go upstairs to her room, she saw me. we locked ourselves in the room , but then there were cops after 30 mins that showed up because fb claimed that i "raped" her and "touched her". wtf. i didn't even acknowledge her. so the cops interviewed us for an hour and her parents were called (they live in a different state) explaining what she had done and a big deal was made. she had also been told she would be denied a stay for the next semester (current semester ending in a month). i was let go due to the false accusation (everyone at home said it didnt happen) but still out in the streets at 4am, sitting on the bench, with the nothing to do but plot my revenge. so it begins. **step 1: petty revenges** after living with my gf in a hotel room for 2 weeks (indian hotels are really cheap), on the last day i go back over to her house in the morning (boys are allowed at this time) and the house is empty since all the girls are in classes. fb has her room locked, but my gf has the house keys with all the locks. so she opens the door to her room. the first thing i do is mix sugar and water (it really attracts ants) and spill a fuck load making a trial from her window to the ground. then i move her matress up and strategically place sugar water over all the corners of her matress. before i could even move to phase 2, i could already see the ants piling up. *phase 2*, i go over to her private bathroom, and there are 2 toothbrushes there. my girlfriend isn't sure which one is hers , so she calls fb's roommate to confirm. (roommate hates her too). i take the toothbrush outside and douse it with mild pepperspray and leave it out for a while. i also take her deodorant spray and put more pepper spray on the nozzle and entrance and let it out for a while. *phase 3*, it had been one of the housemate's birthday the previous day so there was leftover cake in the fridge. gf just knew that fb will want at least a slice if not the entire thing to herself. so i went out to the garden opposite the house, and picked up a small chunk of dog poop and put tiny pieces of feces (not visible) on the cake. gf warned the other housemates not to eat it since it's a prank and later on she bought another cake for the girl. *phase 4*, i pissed on her soap bar, gf took picture. *phase 5*, i put a lot of powder on the rims of the overhead ceiling fan. such that when she comes home around 5 and turns the fan on, her room would be covered in powder. *phase 6*, i leave the gas on in the kitchen , and since she's a smoker , the moment she lights a cigarette, the house would burn down. okay, i'm kidding about this one chill guys , but i did almost briefly consider on the night that i was accused for rape. **step 2: petty revenge in action** so the best part of the revenge starts when i take the flight back home and wait for my seeds of destruction. i reached my country back at around 9pm (india time). my gf tells me that the powder thing just happened so she was pissed and crying about it to the landlady who basically didn't give a shit and asked her to suck it up. i send her an international text message (i have a data plan to send cheap messages) saying "you should put powder more often, it makes your face look prettier." the same night, gf sees that she took a slice of the cake, i text her saying "what you did to me, was quite shitty". she responded "whatever". i responded "speaking of shitty behavior, how was the cake?" no response. gf says she couldn't hear anything in the room all night. she caught on to the toothbrush prank , so that didn't work out. she just texted me "nice try asshole , i'm going to use this as proof" . she took it to the landlady , who again, didn't give a shit. however , she used the deodorant and it was so effective that they all had to leave the house for 2 hours. "enjoying the weather outside?" lastly, after my gf had switched houses the next semester , i sent her the picture of me pissing on her soap bar. at this point, the landlady couldn't do shit, so fb took it to the police who also didn't do shit. after all that happened , "why are you so pissed?" insults ensue... **step 3: pro revenge** okay so if anyone in the world is still reading this, all this counts as just petty revenge. the real pro revenge comes in here. i found out who her boyfriend was , since he studied in the same university. i made a fake instagram account of a girl , and every week i'd upload a new picture. i made it looks completely genuine. i had about 350 followers , 200 following and around 50 posts spread over 3 months. i started messaging the boyfriend, talking to him , telling him that i found him attractive etc. it got to a point where he was like , "i've actually broken up with her now". i call my gf and and confirms with her roommate that they're very well still together. screenshot conversation. send to fb. send text "pity your boyfriend is cheating on you, maybe if you weren't such a bitch..." for the coup de grace. (idk if i said it right) when i went over back to india after 6 months, her roommate had just about had it with her and was going to move out too. she was in charge of the house keys that day, and she was in the university. so i picked up the keys from her, went over to her room again, and planted weed under her bed. (new matress btw) then later on at night , my girlfriend tipped off the landlady about a guy intruder. so there was a security check , but instead of a guy, the security found the weed. they have a 0 drugs policy. she blamed it on her roommate who said she was in university all day so there's no way she could do it. the roommate also testified to fb using the drugs and bullying her into not telling anyone. my gf also testified the same. she was kicked the next week. "2 lessons in life, don't do drugs , and don't fuck with the devil" the uni she went to was in bangalore. (idk if i can post the name or if it's breaking privacy rules of the subreddit?) people always smoke pot there , it isn't that hard to find weed. cops don't care, uni doesn't care . anyway, that is the story of my greatest pro revenge. i've had many of revenges , but nothing this intense. hope you bastards enjoyed it! i am both proud and ashamed of this one.... it was a warm summer night and i was leaving my favorite bar with a friend of mine. we decided to take a short walk to the top of the parking deck a block away, wanting to top off the wonderful night by doing some sightseeing while enjoying our beer buzz. on the way there, while passing under a window, a gravely, clumpy, damp substance falls all over us, getting in our hair and clothes. upon smelling the defenestrated sandy stuff that fell on us, we quickly realized it was used kitty litter that someone had thrown out of their window. and it was putrid. you know if the cat lady was crazy enough to throw her kitty butt clumps out of a window, this bitch most likely had neglected the shitbox for a while, so we had what smelled like half a year’s worth of kitty piss and shit in our clothes and hair. now, my ex used to live in the apartments that the kitty litter came from, so i knew exactly which window the cat shit sand had been thrown from. my friend and i ventured up to the apartment door and knocked on it, so we could tell the poopoo perp that this wasn’t 15-century london, and it is inappropriate to empty your chamber pot into the streets, especially if you don’t look to see if there are any pedestrians below. i knocked, and could see under the wide crack under the door that they turned off their light and pretended not to be home. originally, i was just going to reprimand the cat caca culprit, assuming they were either drunk or mentally ill, but now this disgusting societal menace was going to just pretend like they weren’t home? what a fucking pussy. a revenge plan popped into my head, and i pulled down my pants so i could take a piss on their door to let them know how it felt to be waylaid by a wiz. but i had a problem—all those french fries and pitchers of pbr were brewing something foul in my bowels, and i told my friend i couldn’t pee because i had a turd brewing—which is when a brown light build went off in my head. while my friend was laughing in wide-eyed disbelief, i further pulled down my pants and dropped a lurid log the on their door mat. and this wasn’t just any dingelberry delight— this was a post-pbr and foamy french fry feces squeezed out of my butt like a soft-serve station from the 9th layer of hell. luckily the cat-shit culprit had a swiffer sweeper in their foyer, but tonight it was not being used for clean up. i took that mop and used it to push my recrimination defecation under their door, so when they eventually opened it, my surprise secretion would smear into their apartment, spreading a brown, rancid revenge rainbow on their floor. tl;dr: catshit nitwit dumps turds and pee all over me, so the putrid poopoo-perp gets a personal pie reply. when i was overseas in iraq on my first deployment, i decided to take advantage of our limited tuition assistance (it's free while active duty and doesn't effect our gi bill benefits) and take a few general ed classes to get a jump start on my degree. i chose a computer class (i work in it, simple stuff) and a health class. no big deal. i chose the community college in my hometown, which we will call mcc, because, well.... it's my hometown and it made sense. before starting the class, i confirmed that the school would accept military tuition assistance. disregard the fact that i got c's in both classes because the instructors didn't allow me to make up the tests that i missed while in transit back to the us even though they said they would let me.... that should have been my first clue. several years after these few classes, i was getting out of the military when i received a bill in the mail from mcc for the two classes. i called the education office on base to ask them what had happened, and they informed me that they didn't know - they had sent a letter to mcc to tell them where to send the bill for the classes. i asked if they would send another letter, so they said sure, and they did. a few months later i got a call from mcc saying they still hadn't gotten paid and i had been turned over to collections. i asked if they ever got a letter informing them where to send the bill, to which they replied that they didn't. at this time, i still lived in southern california, near camp pendleton, so i went on base to the education office and asked them for a copy of the letter informing the school where to send the bill. my hometown was 400 miles away, just close enough for a short vacation. so i drove home and walked into the school with the letter and handed it to them. at this point the woman in the tuition office informed me, with a very unpleasant tone that pretty much reeked of "i don't want to deal with you".... &gt;mcc tuition lady: we don't accept military tuition assistance. &gt;me: but i called before i ever even enrolled and asked if you did, and somebody in your office here said you did. &gt;mcc: no, that's wrong. we accept the gi bill, not active duty tuition assistance. &gt;me: how could somebody have gotten those two mixed up? this is the veteran tuition office. you're supposed to know the difference. &gt;mcc: well somebody was wrong. but your balance is still $255 for your classes and all the fees. &gt;me: why don't you guys accept active duty tuition, then? &gt;mcc: well, a few years ago we did, but we never got paid, so we stopped accepting it. they never paid. &gt;me: how long ago? are we talking semesters or decades? &gt;mcc: well, before i worked here. i've been here for five years so it's been a while that we've had this policy in place. &gt;me: can't you guys try billing them this once and see if they will pay up? doesn't it make sense to at least try rather than leaving your students to get screwed and stuck with the bill? i mean, if they don't pay now, fine i'll handle it. but why not just try to send them the bill? i've already spoken with the tuition office on pendleton and in pensacola, florida where the main office is located and they've said they will pay, they just need to be sent a bill. i'll even pay for the stamp if you'll just mail them a freaking bill. &gt;mcc: well if they want us to accept their tuition assistance, they need to approach us to work out a deal on payments. &gt;me: lady, they're the united states military. they've got hundreds of thousands of veterans around the country whom they are paying for and taking care of. they have bigger things to worry about than one community college in a po-dunk town. they're not going to come to you. you're the school who wants the money - you go to them. at this point i left, fuming, because now i have a collection agency calling me all the time over two c's that i didn't even want. i was already going to school somewhere else and had started over! wtf was this mess all about? after some thinking, i decided to write a letter (email, whatever) to my congressman explaining everything that has happened and how i'm stuck with the bill. i mean, the point isn't the money - i could pay it. but what about all the other vets from my area who want to go to school there? what about the people after me who got stuck in the same situation? after writing a letter to my congressman, i decided to get the people involved. i contacted all the local news agencies to see who would do a "human interest" bit. publicly shame these jackasses. i found a friend of a friend who has a weekly column in the local newspaper. i gave him the full details, along with a picture in my dress blues per his request, and he said he'd help me out. yeah, you can see where this is going now. a few days later i got a call from a representative at our congressman's office - i didn't know that stuff actually worked! i explained to him in detail all the trips i had to make back and forth going between the school and the education office on camp pendleton, delivering papers by hand because the school didn't want to cooperate. he said he'd make some calls and try to get this resolved. a few days later, the article ran in the paper. it wasn't front page stuff, of course (our town has enough crime that human interest stuff falls aside), but right there was a picture of me in uniform and a few paragraphs about how the school is screwing me over. a few hours later, the woman from the tuition office calls me back with a very different tone of voice. &gt;mcc lady: hi usmcevan, i really want to help you out with this. let's see what we can do to get this resolved. i found out that the representative from the congressman's office had called her the same day the article ran, and she was getting leaned on heavily from all her superiors. she sent the bill to the proper location, and my bill was paid in full - very quickly. the very next day the school president called a meeting to rewrite their policies on how they handle military students. **tl;dr school declined my tuition assistance, was crappy to me about it and sent me to collections. i got the local media and my congressman's office involved. suddenly the school was willing to take the money.**growing up in a typical suburban neighborhood, i frequently had to interact with the typical neighborhood bullies. my bad luck, however, was that the local bully lived right across the street from me. even worse, the whole family – kid my age, his older brother, and parents – all exhibited the same lack of social niceties and were all equally despised by not only those around us, but by seemingly everyone they interacted with. they seemed to revel in their bad reputations and it was clear by the lack of parental correction even when an adult called out one of the hellions that there would be no change in their demeanor. the father would routinely get into physical altercations with passers-by whose dogs stepped foot on his meticulously manicured lawn; the mother would threaten law suits for slander against the elementary school teacher when summoned to discuss her children’s behavior. the community pastime was discussing the latest atrocity some member of the family had committed. now, i mentioned the father’s lawn – his pride and joy, even more so than his children judging by the amount of time he spent in maintaining it. my home had a prime view of his treasure as we sat up on top of a small hill looking down and across the street on it. summer mornings were frequently started by him firing up some apparatus to coax a little more green out his grass or blow some errant leaves that dared trespass within the confines of his fifty by thirty foot plot of fescue. it was annoying, but we knew better than to complain. someone, however, decided action was needed. to this day i have no idea who the culprit was (i often joke it was my mother but she adamantly denies the allegation) but whoever our justice-spewing vigilante was, my hat is off to them. it was a slow burn and started innocently enough: the father asked my mom if she had noticed any dogs urinating in his yard while they were on vacation. of course we hadn’t, but even if we had, she had better sense than to instigate another fight in the neighborhood. she assured him she’d keep an eye out and keep an eye out we did. it soon became clear the pristine grass was taking a turn for the yellow in a couple spots right in the middle of the jerk-family’s lawn. within days the plan came into stark clarity: a perfectly executed “fuck” spelled in six foot, bright yellow, chemical-burnt grass letters. the father was irate and his bully sons began interrogating us kids in an effort to calm his ire. my honest ignorance served me well and saved me a beating but it piqued my interest in the caper even more. i watched with rapt attention through our front bay window as the bully-dad dug up the offending vegetation. many chuckles were shared in our home while we watched him realize he had replaced a yellow “fuck” for a dark brown “fuck” trench. he quickly fixed the problem by spreading new seed and laying hay over the whole mess. oh, but it was a slow burn, as i previously mentioned. a week or so later we watched as he raked up the hay, plastered to the young grass by regular watering and pampering. once it was all up and bagged, he stepped back to admire his work – the once yellow, then brown “fuck” was now a bright green, young and healthy “fuck.” he exclaimed so loud enough to hear over our air conditioning. bully dad had the whole crew outside in no time, all armed with shovels and hoes, and eventually dug up and re-seeded the whole yard. a few weeks passed and all had returned to normalcy. that is, however, until i noticed another small patch of yellow pop up in the middle of the new grass. i would like to start off by saying that i am not a spiteful person, but after reading a post regarding someones revenge on a former boss i was reminded of a former ass-hat manger that i had a hand in getting fired. i am a chemist by trade. i work in a lab mixing chemicals together to make viable products for consumers. i once worked for a company that made all types of plastic. they were in serious need of a chemist and a friend (whom is the vp) recommended i interview. the job was to be the lab manager. i would be responsible for 3 other chemists and two qc employees. i went through the very long interview process and was offered a job. however, it was not the job that i interviewed for. the management "team" decided that i was too young (i was 25) so they gave to the job to someone else who was older. that person would be the ass-hat manger. i was given a chemist job. it was a good job and it paid well, so whatever. so my first day on the job i am introduced to ass-hat. upon meeting him, he seemed to relish in the fact that he got the management job over me, and immediately started to show it. the lab was going through somewhat of a transformation. the previous manager was a pack rat. as in, he kept every single piece of paper that was ever handed to him. so my first assigned task was to go through every single piece of paper to see if it was relevant. i had to physically remove each piece of paper from the box and scan it over for said relevant info, even though the box clearly said 1972 on it, and all it was was pamphlets from shows or old ass chemical brochures, i still had to go through it. this took me weeks. i was the only person assigned this task, everyone else did there normal job. in the mean time, he was busy showing up for work late, leaving early for his two hour lunch, disappearing for and hour and a half after lunch, and leaving work early. he maybe was seen visible working for 1 hour a day. fast forward to me finishing my assigned task, ass-hat finally allows me to do some actual chemistry work. this is when i found out that he has no real experience working in a chemistry lab. or being a chemist. how do i know? because ass hat decided to mix a couple of chemicals that don't "play nicely with each other" and then proceeds to throw it in the microwave. 60 seconds later we were short one microwave and had a new respect for the fire extinguisher. he followed this up with leaving industrial sized mixers on high speed while unattended (big no no, they could kill someone), starting another small fire in the plant and completely ruined an industrial sized mill. after a couple months of his unsafe lab practices (they continued), i started noticing some changes in his personality. specifically towards people that he deemed a threat to his authority. he got into a very loud verbal argument with our first production manger, who then quit, then proceeded to get into an almost physical argument with one of our salesmen, whom also quit. once those two were off his list, he turned his attention towards me. now for a little back story. i mentioned earlier that i was friends with the vp. (i still am) i have worked for him before and i enjoyed it a lot. hence the reason i applied for the job. i am the type of person that shows up early and leaves late. always have, always will. i take great pride in doing good work. well ass hat took our friendship and my work ethic as a threat to his authority and made it his life's goal to fuck with every single part of my day. he would assign me jobs to do, i would do them, and then he would berate me in front of everyone about how i did it wrong. then he would tell me how to do it "right", and i would fix my mistake and do it exactly how he told me to and he would come back and berate me again in front of everyone about how it was still fucked up. he did this for everything. the best part about all of this was the end of day "meetings." these "meetings" consisted of me going into his office, closing the door, and him yelling and swearing at me for at least 30 mins. topics you ask? think of one, it was probably my fault in some way. this went on 2-3 months until i cracked. i cracked because he got physical, as in shoved me when my back was turned. now, i am not a small person. i am athletically built. i played football, i ran track, and i lifted weights. i don't know what got into him but it got into him in a big way. i was shocked. i had never had a boss do that before. i don't know why, but i just let it happen. so when he was done screaming in my face, i just left and went straight to the bar and had a drink, and another, and another. that was the day i decided that i had had enough. i wasn't putting up with anymore bullshit. i am admittedly not a very creative person when it comes to revenge, so the only type of revenge on a boss that i had ever seen (way before reddit) was from the movie office space. i literally did what that guy did. i just showed up and did absolutely nothing. i came and went when i wanted. i took 45 minute smoke breaks, 2 hour lunches, came late and left early. this drove ass hat insane. and every time he tried to talk to me about it i did exactly what the guy on the movie did, i just never stopped and walked right past him. every time he wanted another "meeting" i just never showed up. i just went home instead. so after a week or two of this, i happen to be wandering around the office and i stumble into my vp friend. he seemed stressed out and i inquired as to why. "the safety inspector is here and he will be doing a walk through of the plant." he said. he told me "to let everyone in the lab know that he was here and not to fuck up." his words, not mine. well because i had literally quit doing what i suppose to do and ass hat had to do what i was suppose to do, and seeing that he is a walking fucking disaster, i took off for my 2 hour lunch. i wander back into the plant after my 2 hour lunch (my food was excellent) and shit has hit the fan. every big wig in the company is in there and they are all freaking out. i walk up and the first thing the vp asked me was "what did you see!!!???" being friends with him i replied "i didn't see shit, what happened?" so word on the street is this. ass hat decided that he owned the place that day and went out and used one of the industrial stand up mixers (think kitchen aid mixer that makes cookies but 8 feet tall) to mix something in a 1 gallon container (i was suppose to be working on this project but obviously wasn't). now, these things are made for containers that hold 500-1000 gallon containers. so he puts this container under this gigantic mixer and realizes that the container cant be strapped down with heavy duty chains. (side note: you need to strap down the containers. these things spin at 3000-5000 rpm. i have seen 1000 gallon containers spin that weight 4,000lbs. that's some scary shit). so what does ass hat do? he grabs a roll of duct tape and tapes that shit on of course! once he plasters that bitch with duct tape, he cranks that mfer up to full blast and walks away. (also a big no no. for those of you that don't know, all machines in any industrial shop have to manned at all times, no exceptions) about 2 minutes into this act of stupidity, in walks the safety inspector. one of the production guys sees this gigantic fine running and promptly runs over and shuts the machine down right as the safety inspector sees it. over walks the inspector to inquire into what the hell is going on right as ass hat walks out of the lab freaking out. asking who shut off his mixer and of course cussing and swearing. he then proceeds to turn the mixer back on, cuss out the production worker, and asks the safety inspector "what the fuck are you looking at?" and walks away. so once i am got done laughing my ass off, i calmly inform my vp and all the other big wigs that i am not surprised. i inform them of their lost microwave, the fires, the destroyed mill (they knew about the mill, they just didn't know how it happened). i told them about the confrontation that occurred in his office, and i told them the truth about some other things they didn't know about. (bottle of scotch in his desk, drunk on the job, etc. etc.). the fire in my vp friends eyes was burning hot enough to destroy worlds at this point and he turns around and tells everyone that there will be a meeting regarding today's events in the morning and orders everyone (40+ people) to go home. we show up the next day and ass hat was no where to be found. the point of the meeting was to inform everyone that ass hat was not allowed within 500 ft of the building and that if we saw him near the building, we needed to call the police. what i found out later was that the police already had him. when my vp friend went to fire him, ass hat got physical, and the security guards with my vp friend got physical back. he was charged with a whole slew of shit, to much to remember. later that day i was promoted to lab manager and given a raise. we celebrated with a glass of scotch that found in ass hats desk. i'm a college student, and like all other college student, i'm poor. i don't get to do a lot of nice things. however, sometimes i will treat myself. i'm a huge fan of [bubble tea] ( one day, my friend and i went to a bubble tea cafe near our campus to celebrate the end of midterms. this particular cafe is a favorite of mine, because i know the manager. we're on a first-name basis, and she'll occasionally give me a free drink, just because. i was hoping to see her again, but a different woman was there, sherry. i went up to the register and placed my order, asking for less ice. sherry's eyes bugged out and said "we don't do that here." i was surprised, because all bubble tea cafes do that. i repeated my request, asking her if she could do if for me anyway, even if it wasn't an option on the machine. she cut me off and said no. i was speechless. this cafe generally had great customer service. i paid and them my friend ordered. sherry worked at a snail's pace. instead of making multiple drinks at a time, she made each drink individually. i watched her make my drink, and to my surprise, she added extra ice to my drink. after 15 minutes, our orders were finally finished, and my friend and i left. we headed back to campus. it wasn't until we were in the dorms that i tasted my drink. to my surprise, my drink was incredibly diluted and the bubbles were overcooked. this bubble tea was a waste of my money. i was so angry that i made a yelp account and posted a long, detailed review about why my bubble tea was terrible. by chance, my friend took me back to that cafe. i saw my favorite manager, and she told me that sherry had been fired because of my yelp review, along with other customers' complaints. i asked the manager if they had a job opening, and they did! i started the week after, working what used to be sherry's shift. one my first shift, i noticed that you can input the customer's ice preference. **tl;dr:** woman makes terrible bubble tea. i write a bad yelp review. she gets fired. i get her job. now for this revenge, you're gonna need some backstory... senior year of high school, i moved to a new school, didn't know anyone except i met this one girl, who we're gonna call r. now r was at first seemingly a nice but strange girl. she admitted she liked me and as i was rebounding from my previous relationship we hit it off. after about 4 month of us being together i caught her cheating on me. i decided that she wasn't worth it and broke things off and decided to completely shut her out. my life started getting better, i started making new friends and things were looking up. that's when the rumors started. they were small things, but either way i knew she was behind it. i ignored them and went on with my life. a week later i hear from some people that her and her new boyfriend were caught having sex off the side of the road in the back of his car. i laughed and made jokes but i again refused to make any comments and left it alone. she confronted me in the halls (in front of the principal) and accused me of starting and spreading rumors about her. i told her she wasn't worth the effort and i walked away. apparently the principal didn't like the 'excessive profanity' she used against me and forced her to formally apologize to him. *now for the story* i came back to school after spring break to be whisked into the principal's office. shortly after sitting down, a police officer comes in with papers. i was being served a restraining order against me for allegations of rape. her affidavit was along the lines of "my ex boyfriend throwawayforjustice9 raped me last november. he has been spreading rumors about me and i highly suspect that he is the one behind the notes in my locker telling me to kill myself" mortified, i was sent home and unable to return to school for about a week. during that week i compile all the evidence i could against her. the fact that we stayed together for 2 months after the allegations and the fact that she spoke of me in such a loving tone. *not the tone of a rape victim*. after the week was up i walked into court prepared for the worst. the judge, a stoic man in his early 50s presided over the case and after all was said and done, i had brought 2 boxes full of evidence (both copies for her and for the judge) while she simply read her affidavit. the judge dropped the order and i was a free man once again. now for the revenge. i left the courthouse and when the court recording was released and i was given a copy, i immediately approached the detective leading the case against me for rape. he dropped the case and instead took up a case of perjury and falsifying a police report. she's going to be spending a few years behind bars for what she did, her new boyfriend left her (strangely enough it was when she was being arrested he left her, not when she admitted to him she made it up), and she's being disowned by her family. she fucked up, and revenge couldn't be sweeter. tl;dr: girl cheats on me, i ignore her, she lies and says i raped her in court, i get her thrown in jail.the mods said my post wasn't petty enough for /r/pettyrevenge and removed it and someone was banned for suggesting i post here, so i decided i should. i worked at a town home community as a leasing agent for 2 months. the job sucked and i had to work on the weekends, but the manager agreed to let me have mondays and tuesdays off. if i didn't get a weekend, i at least wanted mondays off because they suck. i worked by myself 95% of the time. from the beginning, i was barely trained and had no confidence in my job performance. i had no one to call when i had questions, either. the assistant manager (lisa) gave me her login information in case anything i ever did needed a supervisor override. that's how little either managers were around. i was always by myself. when i first started, i went to lunch with another leasing agent (jessica) who worked at our sister property. she was nice, but talked shit on the company real quick. she told me that the petty cash for her property had been short $50 a few months ago and amanda (manager of both properties) had used her own money to force balance it. they both had to sign off on it for audit purposes. another tidbit - i had to input rent payments into a program on our system. lisa informed me that she lived in apartment 205, so that would always show up as "not paid" because it was "different" since she was living there. she told me just to ignore it and that i never had to worry about her. labor day is always on a monday so we were closed that day. when i came to work on wednesday the assistant manager (lisa) informed me that i would have to start working on mondays because they were just so busy. i was pissed. i took the job on the condition that i would have mondays off. i also was told i wouldn't be paid holiday time for labor day because it was a monday and i had that day off. so i was like thanks for deciding that i have to work mondays after the monday holiday. i was pretty open about my annoyance, but whatever. so later on in the day i am checking my personal email, and i have an email from career builder - i still get these emails. i am used to them. i had a profile on there with my resume and just never took it down. well, lisa pops up behind me when i am looking at this email and calls and narks on me to amanda. amanda calls and is basically asking me what my problem is and blah blah. she told me jessica told her that i was negative when we went to lunch that day and i was just talking trash the whole time (ha!!!!). i finally told her i was done with the job and she told me to give her my written two-week notice. the next day, i went to leave the property to go pick up lunch and lisa waltzes in as i am leaving. she gives me some shitty smirk. when i got back from my lunch, she was gone. i got on my computer and my email was all arranged weird. it was arranged by sender instead of by date. i was pissed. i knew that bitch had been going through my email. so, i remembered that she gave me her login info and i logged into her shit to see how she liked it. there were several emails exchanged between lisa and amanda calling me a brat and a bitch and just talking all kinds of shit. i tried to dig up any information about lisa living in 205, but nothing existed. everyone else had a folder of info but there was none for 205. there was not a spare key either. she was living there for free and i knew it. so i decided to email the main guy who worked at corporate. i told him lisa was living on the property and what her apartment number was, i told him about the petty cash fraud, the going through my email, them never being there, etc. i left my work shirt provided by the company along with my keys and had the maintenance guy sign off on a paper saying i did just that. then i took a copy and left the property in just my bra and skirt, no fucks to give. i turned off my phone and changed the voicemail to the message you get when someone has their phone turned off (these chicks weren't exactly brilliant). i got a call from the maintenance guy later that evening telling me that amanda did try to call me and thinks my phone is off and he had to help lisa move all of her shit out of her apartment that day. it wasn't fast enough, because the guy i emailed flew in the next day and cleaned house. lisa and amanda were both fired. tl;dr some bitches were bitches to me so i got them fireda friend of mine owns a bar, he has "4" cctv cameras. only one of those cameras points to the bar tending area where he can see the actions of his employees. i'm there having a beer, its early (5 pm and i'm the only one) when i see the employee go into the backroom and then comes out. something seems off, guy is a bit strange. guy asks me "so you know dean (the bar owner) pretty good?" i go "yea" he goes "yea...i just helped dean install a brand new cctv system in the bar (i know this a lie cause dean and i installed those cameras together)" i go "yea...thats cool how many cameras 4?" he goes "yea all high def" this was a bit strange to me. why we are talking about this? then i noticed him slipping money from the register into his pocket, i call him out on this bullshit. he says "dude dean makes plenty of cash, how about this i'll give you $20 and we call it cool" i fire back "give me $40" he goes "alright" i then say "hey man, let me buy you a drink" so we have a drink, and i congratulate him on his little scheme. i then say "gotta go out for a smoke" its around 6 pm and i call dean up and say "dean your bartender is stealing cash from you, your 5th cctv camera caught him, pretty sure he turned off the other cameras" dean thanks me says to keep him busy until he gets there. so i go back in and we start shit talking dean. and then dean walks in with two lovely police officers and dean immediately says "get out from behind the bar, the cops are here to arrest you for theft" the bartender fired back "dude i didn't steal, and you don't have any proof" to which dean responded "you turned off the 4 cctv cameras but you don't know about my hidden one" guy is told to sit put by one officer as another officer goes back and reviews the footage. its clear as day this guy is stealing. bartender is currently awaiting trail. his case should be open and shut. dean refused to take the $40 back from me and i got my tab for free that night.my former wife loves to take expensive vacations. we live in ohio, which doesn’t exactly have extravagant places to see unless you like to watch grass growing or interstate construction. while we make ok money, i’m convinced she felt the need to single handedly improve the us economy by taking elaborate vacations: broadway shows in new york city, gambling in las vegas, spa’s in arizona, sightseeing in san francisco. the airlines know me so well they ask about my dog when i call to make reservations. his name is fred. in my attempt to try and save whatever i could so the princess could have her nice things i bought this honeywell wi-fi enabled device so i could adjust the hvac while we were away piling up massive amounts of debt on mickey mouse watches. i thought we could save a few bucks by keeping the temp cool in the winter and warm in the summer. the device was easy to install. i did not have the “blue” connector so i had to re-purpose the green one - this required an adjustment to the actual hvac unit in our home. there are plenty of videos on youtube to demonstrate how to do this. within an hour i was up and running. the device works flawlessly. you can adjust the temp from anywhere you have a wi-fi or cellular signal. little did i know that my ex had found someone that had a bit more money than i did and decided to make other travel plans. those plans included her no longer being my wife and finding a new travel partner (carl, a banker). she took the house, the dog and a good chunk of my 401k, but didn’t mess with the wireless access point or the wi-fi enabled honeywell thermostat. since this past ohio winter has been so cold i’ve been messing with the temp while the new love birds are sleeping. doesn’t everyone want to wake up at 7 am to a 40 degree house? when they are away on their weekend getaways, i crank the heat up to 80 degrees and back down to 40 before they arrive home. i can only imagine what their electricity bills might be. it makes me smile. i know this won’t last forever, but i can’t help but smile every time i log in and see that it still works. i also can’t wait for warmer weather when i can crank the heat up to 80 degrees while the love birds are sleeping. after all, who doesn’t want to wake up to an 80 degree home in the middle of june? here is the original link i joined the navy when i was 18, ended up as a corpsman in iraq and afghanistan, and, when i returned, found out that i was going to have to take classes to even become an emt. fuck that, right? so i did the next best thing: i got a degree in economics. now i see you there, grinning ear to ear. what an idiot, right? well, it turned out pretty well for me. i picked up a job for 35k/yr as a business consultant for a smallish company in the area. now, i'll use a pseudonym for my boss's name here, he'd be jeff. so i'm 25, fresh with a ba in econ(studying with sandy pants ain't fun), with a pretty decent job. jeff and i seem to get along, the only problem is that he's...a product on the 80s. everything was about cutting corners and cutting costs as much as possible to stay stable in bad times. but this was around 2009, and my take on it was that it'd lead to businesses continuing to drop out. they cut costs, which cuts demand in the area, which further kills businesses, so we have to expand our areas further and further just to break even. and, you know, i'm okay with this, because where he'd offer his 'expertise' in business, i'd offer mine from an economics standpoint, and much of the time, my ideas ended up with better results. well, jeff doesn't like this, too much. he cut his teeth in business when i was still in diapers, right? so he keeps moving me off projects and onto smaller ones, where the commission isn't as great, and the businesses are already knee deep in cost cutting, so it's almost impossible to turn it around as people keep leaving the area because they've been foreclosed on. but that isn't what got me. oh, no. we're talking about a six figure contract now, and he taps me to work on it because we recently lost a senior analyst. this is my chance, right? so i work with this business for months straight, and slowly, what started as a 10% quarterly loss turned to 5%, then breaking even, before finally turning a profit. it'd be a nice tidy bonus for me. bzzt, wrong! after the latest quarterly report pegged their growth at around 3%, they started slipping back, again. why, you ask? because my boss went over my head and started offering his own consultation. they'd make much more money, he reasoned, if they just cut back on workers, brought on some temps at half the pay of their staff, or eased off of maintenance of their machinery. so they started doing that, and they started falling behind. my boss then blamed this on me, and my "delusions of grandeur" and my "naivete." i figured out that he had been reviewing my work, then replacing my suggestions and analysis with his own. they fired, under his consultation, half of their work force, who knew what they were doing by then, and replaced them with temps who...didn't know what they were doing. the resultant waste numbers blossomed higher than they've ever been, and they were mad. they wanted blood, and my phone was ringing off the hook as they blamed me for their company's negative turnaround. so i quit. but i was so damned mad -- madder than i was when a marine would shake me up at 0300 because he had guard duty at 0400 and the fucking french shared their wine with him. i wasn't doing anything with my money. between extra from gi bill, post 9/11 money, bonuses, and my wonderful paycheck, i already had a stable home, and enough money saved up that i didn't have to work for about 10 years. but that's not revenge, is it? it started small. i worked out of my apartment calling up the small businesses that i had successfully consulted for over the couple years. freed them from the oppressive grasp of my former boss, who had started filling their heads with fear mongering about wasted profit. 1 business turned into 3, then 10. jeff's company was starting to flounder, because while the larger businesses paid much more because of their size and complexity, the bulk of his profit came from the smaller, quicker jobs with tinier independent companies. with this new profit, i put a down on a small property down the road from jeff's office. one of the many businesses that shut down during the recession, partly due to his corrupting influence. i needed more people, so i hired a recent econ grad to help me out. i bide my time, snatching up small contracts, and working on pulling the larger ones. lots of driving, coldcalls, and actively showing up. i finally returned to the company that had trouble before -- the one jeff threw me under the bus for, and lo and behold, who do i find? but jeff himself. the owner of this company was having a rather heated argument with jeff about the state of his business, and jeff, being who he was, was talking his way out of it. so i roll up, portfolio in hand, filled with the successful reports from the small businesses i already took from jeff, and as soon as he sees me, his eyes go wide as dinner plates. in front of god and everyone, i start my pitch, i push this portfolio onto the owner and explain, in cold, calculating detail, how i managed to keep these businesses running. the gears are turning in the owner's head, and jeff looks apoplectic, before i add "before jeff decided he knew better than i did, i was doing this for your business, too." all hell breaks loose. jeff just wails on me. "you ungrateful little shit," and "after all i did for you," "nobody else would hire a college puke with no business experience." the owner had him escorted off the property, and i offered my services to his company for free until he realized that i knew what i was doing. a few months later, i had a neat little six figure contract of my own -- my very first one -- and i brought two more people on payroll. jeff wasn't too happy, though. oh, no. he started sending me harassing e-mails, thinly veiled(or not at all) threats, so i responded the best way i could. i sent him a bouquet of flowers with my card, and on the back of it, "sorry to hear about your business troubles. if you need a business consultation, you're welcome to give me a call." it is now 2016, and his business has shuttered. i'm currently working from home due to a accident that broke my arm(broke it in three places, it is not fun), but my second in command, a woman who also served in iraq, and now with an econ degree of her own, called me on monday. we picked up another six figure contract, and we'll need new people. she had someone in mind for the position, best resume in the pile, a guy by the name of jeff, with 40 years of business consultation experience. i told her to toss the resume and go for someone a little fresher. feels good, man. so fucking good. my family has had a run of bad luck this year. we had a saying last year. "it'll be better in 2015." well, early in the winter, we were greeted with a call of "did you know the marina is on fire?" no, we did not know that. my mother was in denial. we'd gotten this call a few times, because the fire trucks fill up by the marina sometimes, and she figured it was just that. i didn't want to counter that the ice was over ten inches thick, at least. i just hoped it was a *small* fire. it was not. all that was left of the building was a tiny metal frame, on one end. for a bit, it seemed like we could twist this fire into a good thing. that building was *crap,* and we'd never have been able to afford to bulldoze it. it happened in winter, when we never make any money anyway. if there was a time for a fire to happen, winter was a good time. the insurance called it a total loss, so anything we salvaged didn't count against us for payout, but we were able to salvage things. a brief rumour started that it was arson started by us--i might do a post on who started that rumor and why it died so quickly--but it was going good. then the lawsuit came in. we'd had problems with these people before, but a lawsuit felt a bit over the level of the nastiness they were capable of. they were suing us for "harassment" over the other issues, "destruction of family heirlooms" (it was a tree, a baby tree), "trespassing" (on property legally declared as ours), and other property-related stuff. we counter-sued on the not-ridiculous stuff. so, an important thing to know about this area is that the property lines are *fucked.* when my family got the marina, we were sorting out the property lines with four different entities. the parcels were in bizarre places. (one was in the middle of the building, surrounded by another parcel.) the reason for this is because we're on the edge of two counties, who both tried to determine the property lines, and they did so by markers that don't exist anymore, or are now underwater, as the lake levels rise every year. markers literally in the original property lines are "the old oak tree." we did find that one; it's a stump. they were the only people who refused to settle. we had to call in surveyors. our surveyor gave us 10ft of land. they didn't like that. so they called in a surveyor. their surveyor gave us another 30ft. oh yes, we enjoyed that. but on their lawsuit, they tried to go back to the original agreement before any of the surveyors. they had... less than a stable case. we took photos of the property line from the water, and lined it up with old photos. we got a new survey done after we heard they'd tried to trick the system by giving a surveyor the property line and getting him to sign off of it. we used the same company they did. the surveyor gave us even more property. (they aren't pleasant people to deal with.) we had kept this really quiet, taken the high road. however, they shot themselves in the foot, as expected. they put up orange, plastic, fence around their "supposed" property line. (which their lawyer told them to take down, and my uncle did rip down in front of them, but it was too late.) one of the gossips of the lake asked us what was going on, and we were kinda "don't spread this around, but..." knowing he'd spread it around. he did. the whole lake knew that these people were suing us, the people who just had a catastrophic fire take our livelihoods. oh did it get nasty. we had people pouring in, sneaking gossip to help our case. they had a history of doing this. we were told to get a look at this legal document, and that. people with motorcycles offered to drive by multiple times at inconvenient hours, which we explicitly condemned while looking pleased with the idea. because these people were just being so stupid, i was expecting them to be stubborn through arbitration and shoot themselves in the foot during the court case. (and thus, according to state law, pay all our legal fees.) they did actually give in at arbitration. we got the property. they brought in three lawyers from a nearby large city. we had one local lawyer. they then fenced in their tiny, hard-lost, property, with their lawyer watching the whole time. someone dropped by to let us know their fence wasn't up to county codes. if we report it, they would have to rebuild it. we've been a little busy, but i think summer, in the middle of their busy season, is the best time to do that anyway... **edit:** some things: we aren't entirely sure what prompted the neighbors to sue us, but the biggest reason we think is that they knew we were struggling financially, and that we just got a whole bunch of money plopped into our lap after the fire. after all, they weren't asking for just land, but money from us, too. the fire was probably caused by mice nesting in some electrical wires. we know what wall it started on, and there were some freezers on that wall that kicked on and off all the time. (only thing flammable on that wall.) i have pictures of the remains of the building, and those freezers are just *gone.* everything in that entire area was obliterated. we are pretty well-liked around the lake, and the fact that they decided to sue us after the fire was not gone unnoticed, so it getting out, as i pointed out several times, would send the neighborhood friendly mob out if we could get spread the word in a way that did not trace back so clearly to us. (like explicitly asking the source not to spread it around.) they would not have sued us without the fire, and the fire made the neighborhood's reaction more extreme. i posted this to pettyrevenge some time ago and just happen to stumble across this sub and thought i would just share my story for your enjoyment. so here goes, i live in a pretty large gated community and my house is currently going under some renovations. as with any renovations you get junk that needs to be thrown out, so my parents decided to get one of those big containers that can be taken off and put onto the back of a truck (it's lifted onto the truck with a big mechanical type hook thing that's attached to the truck) to throw the trash out (edit - it's called a skip) we got the container pretty late into the evening after the construction people had left and therefore it was empty for the night. the next morning however, we woke up to the container being 1/3 full of random crap and a big ass queen sized bed that looked about 30 yours old. so of course my parents were pissed beyond belief that someone would just dump their trash into our container after we paid for it and now we don't even get to use the whole thing. now on to the revenge part of the story, as i was looking into the container staring in disbelief when i saw something sticking out of one of the trash bags, lo and behold it was a letter... with the perpetrators address. what do we do? well, that night, me, my brother and my father decided to return to these people all the trash that they so graciously left in our container. but since they were inconsiderate enough to dump it in our container, we decided to dump it all over their driveway and in front of their cars so they could not be able to leave without cleaning up. revenge is sweet and the neighbors did not even come and thank us for returning their stuff. how rude. tldr: neighbors dumped their trash in our skip, gave it back to them... all over their driveway i'm back guys :) another one from the car world. in my many years of being in this business i've met very few "natural sales people" i am not one of them. i got to where i am by discipline, thick skin, and drive to succeed. i'm not a mind reader, and i stumble over myself from time to time. however every once in awhile i run across a gifted sales person and surprisingly they are some of the most difficult, and often times unprofitable sales people. they know they are good, and therefore they think they have free reign. well as many of you know i work a group of dealers and over the years we've acquired various dealers well i remember we acquired a new dealership, it was a chevy dealership, and i remember in my first meeting with the store manager we went over our staff. we where reviewing our sales staff and one guy stood out to me...john who always seemed to be selling 30+ cars a month...impressed with his numbers i mentioned this to the store manager who sighned i asked "whats wrong" he went on to explain john is good, and john knows he is good, and therefore he runs lose with the rules, and causes the mgt a headache. however the old owner put up with it cause he represented such a large portion of the dealers business. i however do not believe your performance gives you a free pass. sure if your a rockstar and make a mistake i'm not going fire you over it, but that doesn't mean you can do whatever the fuck you want. i said thats fine i'll watch john and his habits but first i'll have a sit down with john and explain what is expected of him. so later that day i sat down with john, a pleasant enough guy (of course he would be) and i asked him about his behavior, he of course denied that he was a reckless individual, just a top performer. that's fine so i personally went over with our employee conduct code. now for those of you don't know i have an employee conduct code, it basically is a set of guidelines/rules/and what we expect out of you. it includes things such as * no relationships with customers * no using dealership property for direct personal benefit * treat all customers and employees with respect * no duis * no drugs on the premise * leave home at home * be honest both to your dealership and especially to your customers * etc i then explain to him that him that i expect my employees to first follow the code of conduct, then worry about business. john of course agrees and signs, all is good. maybe he won't be a problem. not even 2 days later i was taking a breather outside the office in the doorway, and john was to the left of me but couldn't see me as there was a large pillar blocking his view when i heard a customer approach john. the customer explained that he was here for another sales person, he had an appt, and was ready to buy...i then witnessed john blatantly lie to the customers and explain that particular sales person wasn't available and that he was instructed to take care of the customer (completely) not true. i walked away and found the sales person and i told him that john was currently selling his customer but not to worry cause i'd transfer the deal to that sales person and he'd get all the commission and do none of the work. john of course sold the customer, proud of his accomplishment i approached john and advised that i witnessed him skate another sales person, and reminded him that was against dealership policy. he brushed it off and said "don't matter i made bank" to which i then advised him that he was getting $0 for his work and the sales person who had the appt will be receiving 100% of the deal and this is to serve as a punishment for him. john was furious, it was a nice check (about $850) i reminded john i'm the new king of the hill and i play differently and he needs to adjust. we go home for the day with no further incident. a few days later i'm driving over to the dealership when i see one of our cars without dealer plates sitting in a red lobster parking lot, this is completely against company policy. one a show car is to not be driven off our lot without dealer plates, and show cars are not to be used for personal gain. i of course turn into the red lobster walk into the restaurant to see which one of my sales people are using dealership property for personal gain...sure enough its john sitting there enjoying his meal i approach him sit down and the look on his face was priceless. i advise him he is using company property for personal gain and that is against our code of conduct. i then advise him he is suspended from work without pay for the up coming 4 day weekend. i also advise him i will have the car towed back to the dealership and he can figure out how he's going get home...he protests. says i can't reasonably expect him to walk home in this heat (it was the summer) and that he is very sorry...nope not having it. i leave him be have the car towed back to the dealership. his suspension was enforced and he didn't work that holiday weekend it cost him a bundle too. he also got to enjoy the long walk back to the dealership in the summer heat! come that tuesday i sat down with him and explained to him that he is on his 2nd strike and another incident and he's out of here. he didn't seem to take my threat seriously, i advised him that even though he sells 30 cars a month i can easily hire 3 people to do his work and the dealership will still live on. a week goes by without incident, and then on a monday morning i get a call from the store manager saying we need to have a talk about john so i drive over to the dealership and sit down with the store manager. he says i need to go visit john...so i do. john looks like complete crap, he has a black eye, a bruised face, and walks with a limp. concerned i asked what happened he says he made got into a shuffle with a family member over a personal argument. feel bad for the guy but he won't get into any detail. i advise him to do his best to look his best and let me know if he needs to go home early. i leave and i'm by the front desk when i see a very angry man who just a few weeks ago bought a car from us enter our dealership. lets call him jason. he asks to speak to a manager i quickly get involved, this isn't normal this guy is steaming and something is seriously wrong. i'm deeply concerned that maybe a safety issue caused an accident or something like that. all i know is something is seriously wrong. i pull the guy into the back office, he is fuming, he is angry, and he is pissed i clam him down, advise him i'm here to help him through his issue and that i would love to help him. he then finally explains what happened. a few weeks prior his wife and his worked with john (name keeps popping up again) and bought a car, i wonder "did john lie?" or "whats up" he continues on and explains that last night he came home from a 12 hr shift to find john in his bed with his wife (lets call her cindy...he is fumming angry, is upset that we would hire such a person, and then i inquire is this the reason why john looks like he got the crap beat out of him. he admits that he did beat up john and he feels that we should know what john is up to. i thank him for his time, advise him i will handle this swiftly, i explain to him not only will i deal with the sales person in question i gave him some extras on his car for free (actually quite a bit) i also advised him that this behavior is unacceptable. i pull johns phone log (all of our sales people are provided with cell phones for work, those phones automatically upload their call log to our system) sure enough their is quite a bit of texting/calling going on between john and cindy. starting after the sale of the car, and into the evening...this is not normal. your car sales professional shouldn't be calling/texting your wife at midnight. so i page john into the office and i ask him if he knows cindy. he denies it i show him the call log, he admits that he does indeed know a cindy. i then ask him if he knows a jason, he admits that he knows a jason. then i ask him "did jason beat the shit out of you cause you where fucking his wife cindy?" his head is down, he knows the game is over, he looks up and says it is. i then fire him, the look on his face was priceless, he protested he said "you can't afford to fire me, i'm the top sales person, i out perform everyone by at least a 2 to 1 margin" to which i responded "i can't afford to keep you on the payroll, i can't afford having my sales people skate others, show disrespect, use company property for personal gain, and fuck my customers wives, i can't afford that and therefore your done" that day john left for good know what the funny thing is? we saw an upshot in business overnight, our other sales people moral improved, and every picked up johns slack and we sold more cars then ever...since john left we've never had a month worse then when john was working for us. tl:dr top performer thinks he's we can't afford to fire him...when in reality we can't afford to keep him.i had been hoping this story would make one more turn in my favor which would have ended in a higher level of /r/prorevenge, but last night, my revenge embers cooled. i'm going to try to make this as short as possible, but i really suck at making things short winded, and there is a lot that happened. and now that i've typed it all out "short" it is not. **the background** in august of 2014, i left my job as a dispatcher to pursue a new position as a buyer for a major food packaging company in their production department. dispatching was second to my job of purchasing, however, the dispatching aspect left me working 10-12 hour days and being on call 100% of the time. the new company promised it'd be an easy 40 hour work week, with occasional ot here and there. unfortunately for me, i did not get this in writing and took the position as a salaried employee. i tried to negotiate a 6-month review with potential for a raise, but was declined. oh well. the hours would be less and i was cutting my commute in half. the first month, everything went well. i worked with some really cool people and i was proving i could handle the workload with ease. **the turn toward nopesville** well, right around the 1 month mark, the woman that did purchasing for their maintenance department put in her 2-week notice. this was no surprise because everybody knew she was going to school to become an rn. what was a surprise is that i was now expected to learn and perform her job as well. i already had a pretty good grasp on the first position, and figured taking on the second position would be a good challenge and further prove myself as a valuable employee with maybe an extra hour's work per day. i asked again for a 6-month review which they agreed to (again i didn't get in writing, but it wouldn't matter in the end). through this company's massive financial success, they never bothered to upgrade their purchasing system for maintenance purposes. there was no inventory system, nor any way to generate a proper purchase order (po) in the system, so i had to manually type out everything onto an excel spreadsheet, then generate a generic po in the system. then, i had to track all purchases on a separate document. it was a very cumbersome system that led to me working 12-hour days again. there was no way to track a specific item to any vendor without searching through hundreds of files/pos and hope someone wrote a decent description. at this point, i was relying solely on the memory of the mechanics (most of which had only been there for &lt;6 months). needing to do constant stock checks and asking the mechanics to teach me about some of the processing equipment (so i could have some idea of what i was buying), i was not always at my desk. despite having a radio on my side at all times, the plant manager complained that i was never in my office, and i needed to notify him via email or radio every time i walked away with a reason. this included going to the bathroom. this isn't elementary school, and me not being at my desk does not put someone's life at risk. i begrudgingly comply, but this is the first major strike in my mind. the rest i chocked up to a loss due to my incompetence (not getting things in writing). still, i wanted to turn this around and see if i could make this work. i learned the system we used was actually quite versatile, and with a few hours of initial setup, i could build an inventory for the maintenance side in the system, and generate clear and trackable po's. since i was salary, i could come in on a weekend and knock it out. halfway through my proposal to the plant manager, he cut me off and told me he didn't want to do it. i tried to explain how this would help the company monetarily and time-wise (not to mention the sad sack that got the position after me having to deal with the same bs), but he flat out said "no." strike two. we're now at the end of november and into the early part of december. the company is rebranding their pasta sauce line and introducing some new recipes. i had to source several new ingredients and order huge quantities for their first run which would begin in january of 2015. it was tough, but i was making progress while also barely keeping my head above water in the maintenance department. then i am given the news that the woman in charge of purchasing all packing materials is taking a 2 week vacation for christmas. my requested time off for my birthday (the week before christmas) is being denied because i need to cover her position as well. why? the **purchasing manager** has not been trained on how to make a **purchase order**. so now purchasing anything for the entire plant rested on my shoulders. this is now strike three, and i begin posting my resume and applying for jobs again. i was going to continue working until i found something (anything) else to get me away from this place. by this point, i had already discussed quitting with my girlfriend, and my savings would keep me from putting her in any economic harm for at least 6 months with current spending. when i got to work the day before my birthday, i opened my email to find 16 emails from the overnight crew throwing me under the bus for not ordering a certain part. before i could get through all of them, the plant manager was in my office explaining that i was underperforming and this couldn't happen again at risk of being fired. i showed him the emails that proved the mechanics lied about when they tried to order the part, me following up with the vendor to get a status, and the fact that the mechanic only gave me half of the information the vendor needed. i again explained my plan that would drastically reduce these issues if i had any sort of way to view past purchases, and i would have known *exactly* what was needed. his response was, "just deal with it." strike four, numb nuts. i neatly stacked everything i was working on depending on their status; forwarded a few emails to back up my side to my personal email; and sent an email to the plant manager, hr, and the production manager explaining that i was leaving the company and where everything was that i was working on. i included my address to send my final 2 checks to (it was always wrong on my paychecks, which i had several emails asking them to correct, but they handed them out on payday so it wasn't a huge issue). i collected my things and walked out the door, passed all of their offices which were all empty. had they been there i would have stopped to explain. **the revenge** a few days later, in what was the normal payday, i received my typical automatic deposit. it was only for the last full period i worked, and did not include the few days i worked into the next period or my accrued vacation time. i had also not received the check stub, which arrived nearly a week later with the incorrect address. it was delivered to the address on the envelope, and then finally made it's way to me after being returned to the mail carrier. before i sent another email asking them to correct the address, i decided to look up state laws on payment upon termination of employment. oh, was it eye candy... in my state, if someone quits, they must receive all owed payment within 72-hours. for every day late after that, they are to pay the person as if they were still employed (if they pay on day 4, they are to add 1 additional day's pay). also, any previous agreement of automatic deposit is voided upon the termination of employment unless there is a written agreement at that time. there was also a list of state fines associated with each infraction. i composed my email to hr and explained the laws they were violating as well as requesting they update my address, and if they would mail me my final check within two days i would not pursue any legal action. hoping they would reply with reason, this would all be settled by the middle of the week (which was dec 31, and also two days before the next scheduled payday). their response the next day stated that i would receive my automatic deposit on friday since i had agreed to that upon my initial employment. this time i replied with direct links to the state's website and laws they were violating, and stating how simple this would be in court. all i wanted was what i was due, and not asking for anything extra. there was no response until the next day (the deadline i gave them) when fedex knocked at my door with an envelope containing my check stub. not an active check. there were no deposits into my account until that friday when the normal payday was scheduled. at this point, i'm actually impressed with their carelessness and oversight in messing with someone who literally has all day to himself. now is time to make a real request for everything i can legally ask for. this email again explained all of the laws they have violated and requested the full amount due. i even calculated the amount they owed me for the late payment (16 days minus the 72 hours rounded down to the nearest $5 because i'm a generous person). i had kept every email professional because i know that if this does go to court, i cannot look like a complete ass (i already had walking out on a job going against me). again, hoping they'd side with reason, i detailed how much extra can be awarded to me (up to 3x the late payment amount), plus a total of the state fines. their reply this time was simply "no." the court documents were downloaded and filled out the following monday, but i was going to give them one last chance. another email, again detailing the laws, and the corresponding sections of their employee handbook citing these laws and how ignorance of the law is no defense, but explicit knowledge and failure to follow them would not be in their favor. to add a little additional spice, i copied the ceo on this email. i concluded the email requesting resolution by the end of the week, or court documents would be filed. an hour later i received a response from hr that their lawyer would contact me by the end of the week. by that friday, i had a check for the late payment, plus a second check for double the amount if i agreed to not take them to court (which i did agree to). back to what i alluded to in the beginning, since this was now reported income for the 2015 year, i would need a w-2 from the company in order to file my taxes. on the day i received those checks, i set a reminder to pursue whatever course i could if they failed to do so. my dreams were dashed when my girlfriend sent me a picture of the envelope last night. i even made sure to verify every cent *just in case*. in the end, i'm happy it didn't resort to that. i now have a great job/career path, and i do not want to waste anymore time on an old employer. **tl;dr: op gets new job, op leaves new job, op executes win all the money, op wins all the money.** edit: missed words and poor spelling edit 2: tl;dr as scribed by /u/xponcex because my tl;dr would need a tl;dr of it's own.i first posted this in r/pettyrevenge but it was taken down for not being "petty" enough. i thought you guys might like this story of cheaters justice. i'll go ahead and be specific because honestly i don't give a fuck if she sees this post or not. i was on vacation last winter and met a girl at the beach. we hit it off, she was very attractive, 8/10 at least. she lived by the coast and i lived in central nc, about a three hour drive away. we begin meeting up regularly, going on trips (that i always paid for), we even went to nyc and when i brought up her paying her share of the hotel costs, she said she would "pay me back on the next trip". on that particular trip she brought a friend of hers and that friend's fiancé, and they all seemed pretty distant with me, like none of them gave a fuck and they were just three friend's there having fun while i paid half the bill. i know, i know, i was a dumbass. i thought we had a pretty good relationship going. after about six months though she starts flaking out when i want to hang out, not returning texts for hours, one word answers when she does return them, after a while i decided she just didn't want to see me any more and we stopped talking. she starting posting pics of her and another guy on facebook, referring to him as "darling". oh well, i thought, just another girl hell bent on wasting my time and money. a few months later she contacts me though, apologizing for how she treated me and how bad she feels about what happened to our relationship. she wanted to meet up again and go on another trip with her friends, this time to atlanta, she wanted to see a braves game, go to the aquarium, etc. anyway, i told her that i forgave her and i would love to go with her and her friends! i had other plans in mind... she asked about the tickets to the brave game and i told her that if she wanted to go she could just order the tickets online and i could pay her for my ticket later, she said that was fine. we agreed to meet up in charlotte and they could just park their car there and ride with me to atlanta (they never offered to help me with gas money). long story short, the last snap message i got from her before i blocked her number and blocked her on all social media was a pic of the charlotte skyline that read "almost there!" i read the message from home while drinking a wine cooler and watching a movie. the thought of her and her friends driving aimlessly around uptown charlotte looking for me still brings a smile to my face to this day.  long time lurker, first time poster. for years, my parents used to tell me not to worry about bullies, because some day they'd be working for my interests. i grew up being bullied all through grade school, by a majority of my peers; at a small religious school within the lower 48. i never had any beef with anyone, not even petey; the main school bully. petey was smaller than i, but walked around like he was tough shit when his "boys" were around. he liked to agitate me into responding, and when i did, his posse would come from nowhere to beat the living crap out of me. teachers rarely intervened in fights, and when they did, i was in trouble most of the time because, "you're the bigger person, you should know better." never figured out how it was my fault that 6 kids decided to kick me black and blue, but i was the only one who got a paddling for it. at the end of my last year at this school, they had this year-end party, complete with water balloon fight at the end. as everyone was drying off after it was over, i heard someone yell, "petey, nooooooo!" i turned around to see him running at me with his arm cocked back and throwing it forward towards my back. the balloon he held, was thrown with a force, that knocked my face into the dirt. i came to with him kicking me as people were dragging him off me. soon after that, i was taken out and put into another school where i excelled beyond expectation. some many years later, i was summonsed for jury duty. i was one of the lucky cunts out of hundreds picked for such a prestigious honor. they'd tell us before hand the names of the people who would be on trial, so we could be excused if we knew them. guess who's name appears, old petey. and what for? the area's largest narcotics bust in 20 or so years. i didn't know this fool, anymore. i don't want to say i helped put this sad sack of shit away, but i will say i'll never forget the look on his face when he entered that courtroom in chains and saw me sitting in the front row. he'll be eligible for parole when my kids have grandkids. i was told this belongs here... many years ago, around midnight on the eve of my 21st birthday, i sat in stunned silence as my ex-girlfriend told me that she had been raped a couple weeks prior at a party. as she told the story, including the part where her friend was banging on the locked door and screaming, trying to get someone to stop it, i felt helpless, angry, and confused all at the same time, in a way i never had before. it was truly my introduction to adulthood, in a way. though she had gone to the hospital, had the rape kit done, and filed a report, charges were never pressed. the guy's fraternity brothers had cornered her afterwards and said that if she tried to go to the police, they would all testify that she was lying, and use their connections to prevent the case from proceeding (one was the son of a state senator). the da declined to pursue the case, mostly because she was too scared to cooperate, but also because his family hired a lawyer to proactively stonewall the process. needless to say, she was a wreck. two days later i visited my college's counseling center. i had found myself so enraged, i was actually planning the rapist's murder in my head, and i had even talked to a friend about helping me (who then suggested i see a counselor). in the months that followed, i gradually came to terms with everything, and how my anger resulted from things i had witnessed as a volunteer firefighter/paramedic. it was considered a form of ptsd, but from an emotional standpoint, it was this stunning realization that life, by design, isn't as fair as i had been brought up to believe. fast forward six years. i really hadn't kept in touch with my ex-girlfriend very well. one day, i got a friend invitation on myspace (this was years ago) from her, and i gladly accepted. through the messaging feature we caught up and exchanged phone numbers. i learned that she was doing well, and she only had a few months more of her residency before she would become a doctor. she had also married and was expecting her first (of four) children. a few weeks went by and one night she called me. she told me that she had searched for me and reconnected because she had some news. seems the rapist had recently been convicted of another rape, and she wanted to be there for his sentencing. she asked me to go with her, as her husband was out of the country, her mom couldn't go because of her health, and she wanted someone there for support, and she felt it may give both of us a sense of closure. i went with her, but we didn’t know there was going to be a hearing, first. i won’t go into the details, but all i can say is that it was really hard to stomach. after both sides had people read statements, they broke for a brief recess. the recess was a lot shorter than i pictured it. we came back in and the judge said something about “ensuring there is sufficient time to take advantage of the opportunity to rebuild his character” then gave him 5-20 years, which i thought was really odd (being so wide, and all). here comes the revenge: after his lawyer spent what seemed forever arguing that he should be released pending appeal (denied), they adjourned, and the spectators from each side avoided eye contact and did sort of an awkward exit. my ex, being very pregnant at the time, had to stop at the rest room on the way out. as i'm standing there, some guy standing near me said "bummer, huh?" for some mysterious reason, i got this weird feeling i should pretend to be on his side, and just nod. he asked how i knew the defendant, and i said i went to college with him. when i was asked if i was in his frat, i lied and said i was. we had a brief conversation, and the guy spilled to me that it was likely they were going to send him to a prison that happened to be in the city i lived (not sure how he would have known that but, like i said, the kid’s parents were well connected). when my ex came out, the guy congratulated us on the baby, and before she could correct him i said "thank you. hey we gotta hit the road. ready, babe?" she gave me a weird look, and said "sure. let's go... babe." as we got to the car i explained what had happened, and thanked her for playing along. she knew i was up to something and asked why i was excited that he may be at the prison near me, and i said "oh, it'll just make me smile when i drive by knowing that he's getting at least a taste of what he deserved." but i had something way worse planned. you see, i was friends with the cos, and on a first name basis with the superintendent/warden. when i got home i rang up one of the cos and asked if he'd meet me for a few drinks. a couple nights later we sat down and had a few beers and i filled him in. i made sure to tell him about the threats his frat brothers had made, and insinuated that his family had connections with many prominent democrats. i also told him the guy was jewish. now, i may have been stretching the truth a bit, but i knew this co pretty well, and there was one thing i always hated about him: he was an anti-semite, and he hated democrats because he thought the party was run by "sneaky jews." truth be told, i have no idea who this rapist and his parents were connected to, and i was pretty sure he wasn't jewish, even though his name suggested as much. the co said that he'd look into it, and if it was true he'd be there, he'd make sure he was given "...the royal treatment." a little over a year goes by, and i totally forget about everything. one night, i'm at the bar of our local vfw and i run into the co who is having drinks with some of his other co brethren. they were absolutely shitfaced. he slaps me on the back and says "ah, thanks for the yuks!" i didn't know what he meant, and he says "your [slur for jewish people] pal... the one that raped your girl. oh boy, you have no idea how much fun we've had with him." basically, when he got there, they put him in segregation right away (single bed, but not the solitary confinement kind). they told him it was for his protection, and he thought his parents pulled some strings. the real reason they did it is because that's usually the procedure for informants. i don’t even want to know how they got the chief officer to approve it. when he was brought back to general population they started telling everyone that he was jewish, which apparently is a bad thing if you want to integrate yourself with the white guys. in addition to being hated by the other inmates and, on one occasion, roughed up a bit in yard time, they started "banging" him for even the most minor infractions. as a result he started getting testy during his constant hearings, which resulted in lengthier punishments. his life was a living hell. the cos also got some of the bigger inmates to intimidate him during shower time, and they would pretend to walk away for a few minutes to "let him get to know his fellow inmate better" (they would never actually let him get raped, though. if he were to report a rape, the responsible co would get in deep shit.), just to see him sweat. i guess that in one short year the guy had pretty much been through hell, and the night that they were drinking with me, he had been sent to the infirmary for a psychological episode of some sorts. earlier that day, he had learned from another inmate that all of the infractions on his file made it near impossible for him to get paroled in his first hearing, regardless of how well he did in the years to follow. he didn't take it well. i know what i did was, objectively, wrong. but it just feels so right. when i drove by the prison, i would smile and wave. recently, though, i learned he had been transferred at some point. i don't know where. but i hope he's getting the royal treatment there, too. so this all happened around a year ago. i was a senior in highschool and my friend and i were looking for some spare cash to be made, naturally, so we went 'window shopping' for jobs at our local mall. after browsing for any store that was possibly hiring we walk past a pillow kiosk. the kiosk donned a "now hiring" sign so my friend and i applied. luckily for us the owner was there and hired us on the spot... red flag! he took our names, addresses and emails (no social security, i will get to that later). breakdown of the job: stand at the pillow stand, approach people and ask them to buy overpriced pillows. if we sold x amount of product then we would be able to make commission. before i press on i need to say my father has always given me this golden advice, "always have evidence of your hours." to which i have taken photos of my punch times for every job i have had. right, moving on. our bosses were two israeli gentlemen who said we would be paid every wednesday (they were personal checks, again a red flag). i worked there for two weeks without a hitch, making commission for nearly every day i worked there. third week rolls around and the mall wasn't as busy as it was normally (possibly attributed to nice weather) and i had no chance of making commission for that day. *oh well* i think, *it's no big deal*, i think. i was wrong... sort of, as it turned out to be a hassle for me, financially crippling for them. the day after my missed commission day i get a call while on my lunch hour at school. "fdbs, it's me, bossman, i see you did not sell much pillow yesterday and this is being unacceptable. i will not be paying you for this week." "but mr. bossman, that is illegal. you have to pay me for this week." "i cannot pay you for this week, you not sell many pillow yesterday." oh man, oh man. here it comes. as an angsty high school senior i couldn't wait for this. i knew what was coming, as i had documented my hours and everything. i show up at the pillow stand after school to confront him, and he once again says that he cannot pay but this time he said i cannot prove my hours, "see!" he says as he pulls up the now blank punch card. "oh thats unfortunate, but... see!" as i pull up my phone with all the pictures on it. he gets really hesitant and visibly distraught. "as i have said, i cannot pay..." said mr. bossman "do you want me to call the irs?", i said. "ah - you do not need to call them, why you threaten me? i will pay you only because you do threaten me and i feel like untrue things will be said to the irs.", said mr. bossman. to sum up the next part of the story, my friend and i quit that day, we got paid in full 3 days early (again personal check), and oh, thats right, i called the irs to report tax evasion (as the bosses never took taxes out of our checks, never took our social). we got audited and had to pay roughly $50 in back taxes, however they were no longer at the mall the following week (they had mentioned having a yearly contract that was up in december, this was may). tl;dr: sketchy pillow salesman hires my friend and i, tries to not pay me, pays me and loses his business and gets in trouble with the irs for tax evasion. this story isn't about me, but about my mum when she first came to america with my dad. backstory: my mum is a native korean. she speaks english quite well, but being her second language she does have a slight accent. my dad is american and english is his native language. at the time of this story, they were newly weds, so it was like the early 90's. so they were shopping at some store, like a wal-mart or something and my mum needed to find an item, so she asked a worker in the aisle if he could help her. his response? &gt;learn to speak english before you talk me. well my dad was within earshot and boy oh boy, he was not happy with that comment. long story short, my dad demanded to see the manager and that guy lost his job right there and then. moral of the story: don't be an racist asshole.it all started with trying to find a replacement phone on montreal’s classified section of kijiji. i was on the hunt for a brand new samsung s5; i ended up finding one fairly priced (420$) and the individual selling it lived 10 minutes away from my house. we ended up setting up a meeting and he agreed to sell me his brand new: rogers samsung s5 for 400$. i’m somewhat tech savvy person and i’m fully aware of all these fake replicas and blacklisted imei numbers. i did my due diligence and asked him to send me his imei number over text message. the imei was clean and everything seemed to be in order… i ended up meeting him at 4:30pm in the west island of montreal; he was about 17 years old, had a red t-shirt and came on his yellow bike. he seemed like a nice young man and he was very respectful. i inspected the phone; everything looked new and i verified both imei on the box and the phone; they both matched. the smartphone even had the rogers bloatware; i put my sim card in and everything worked flawlessly. i had no doubt that everything about the transaction was kosher. then, everything started going downhill from here. once i got home; i did a factory reset of the phone and got “invalid imei” message. i did some research online and found out that he rooted the phone and replaced the imei on the user interface to match the one on the box. he obviously sold me a fake, which had no figure print sensor (it didn’t cross my mind to verify that feature). the box and accessories were original and the imei on the box was clean; but the phone itself wasn’t an original samsung s5. i tried contacting the seller the same night but he wasn’t cooperative. after a few messages; he finally agreed to give me my money back; the next morning 8:30am at the same location. that same night i did some investigation on the individual: he deleted his kijiji ad and he used an online forwarding service for his phone number. i started looking in google street view to find the residential areas around where we meet up. and this is what i saw! the same kid on the bike going into his house! busted! the next morning, i waited for him at the same location to get my money back like we both agreed. as i expected, it was a no show. he ditched last minute and never showed nor did he answer my calls. . i knocked at the house from street view but no answer i decided to drive around the area trying to spot him or find something that would give me a lead. i had no luck and ended up leaving empty handed. but i didn’t give up yet! fast-forward 1 week, it was sunday august 17 2014. i drove around the same area and spotted a car waiting in front of that house. i decided to keep my distances and keep an eye out. 15 min goes by and whom do i see…that scumbagg walking towards his house with some grocery bags. i quickly get out of my car and confront him. he was very surprised to see me but he was very calm. i didn’t get physical but i was following him the whole time giving him his options. #1 he gives me my money back and we both go our separate ways or #2 i call the police and he gets in trouble. the scammer didn’t care and he had no intention to give me my money back. i followed him into a public bus (i guess he thought he could get away and i wasn’t going to follow him anymore). so i’m in the bus with this scammer not far from me and the cops are on the way. 5 minutes into my bus ride; a cop van stops the entire bus. the cops come in and i pinpoint them to the scumbag. i ended up getting my money back (which was his best option) and they arrested him for possession of stolen goods. his personal phone he had in his pockets was reported stolen. i consider myself lucky of finding this guy thanks to street view. be very vigilant out there. cliff: - got scammed a fake phone on kijiji - scumbag playing games with me - i end up finding him on street view - 1 week later, i see him on the street - i get my money back - cops arrest him - win!i live in michigan where the pot holes are on a whole other level then the rest of the country. anyways as i was driving the speed limit taking my grandma to her monthly dr appointment she was fast asleep when all if a sudden this ass hole in a silver lexus idk what model was right on my ass. i brake checked him 2 or 3 times to no avail and decided to let it go when a plan popped into my head that probably wouldnt work. i was familliar with the road and knew there was a pot hole coming up that was the bane to many a car tire and i coasted a bit just to piss the guy off a bit more and started to pick up speed as i started to draw ever closer to this dead fall in the middle of the road. the whole time this little lamprey stuck tight to the ass end of my car had no idea what was coming. praying to the road gods that it wasnt patched up yet to allow my plan to come to fruition and just when my doubts were about to overcome me the clouds opened up and shown light on the opening abyss which had grown since the last time i had driven down this road. with the precision driving skills of jeff gordon on ritalin i cut over just inches from having been sucked into the gaping black pit. i heard a loud popping then banging sound before i looked back to see the effects of my scheme knowing i had done gods work for the day. i looked in my rearview and not only was his tire completly blown out but the rims were completely bent out like the delorians tires from back to the future 2 when it starts to fly. 30 minutes later driving back the same way i saw the car still lamed in the street and honked while giving the guy the finger as i drove by it felt good. tldr. asshole tailgating me fucked his car up on a giant pot hole i swerved around at the last minute.so we have a portable heater in my parlor, and some of the kids in the neighborhood thought it would be funny to take the portable heater so that the elderly in my house would be aggravated. they didn't know that we had some cameras in my house. so the kids broke a window to my house, stole the portable heater, and the elderly in my house were distressed. i reviewed the footage and sent it to the police. the kids were charged with grand theft (portable heater valued at $700) / breaking &amp; entering. one of the kids was an upstanding citizen at his high school and lost his scholarship for college. made me feel good that we got the whole thing on tape and he suffered for it. all this happened back in the late 90's/early 00's. i was a cocky li'l sysadmin, contracted out to a large dutch tv production company whose excrement..... sorry, "products" are sold, produced and braodcasted worldwide. i was stationed at their main facility, a large studio and office complex where the majority of their dutch language tv-shows were recorded. and to be honest, it was actually great fun to run into tv personalities all day, every day. most of them were really quite nice, in particular to the pfy who was trying to fix their macbooks. of course, every now and then you'd run into someone who was a bit arrogant but i'd usually manage to get them to drop their attitude by just talking to them like a normal human being. dealing with celebs is all in a day's work under such circumstances. and besided, you'd usually deal with them indirectly, through their production teams. i seldom had to deal with the production teams anyway, as i primarily dealt with mac-based workstations and servers, which never had gave me any real troubles: sometimes the odd macintish performa would pop a psu capacitor or i'd have to zap the pram on a mail server. piece of cake. but supporting macs wasn't why i had been contracted out to begin with - i was a windows nt-guy, and the company had decided they were going to switch to windows. now, to phase out 900+ servers and workstations at once was a bit more expensive than the executives were willing to accept, so a compromise had been agreed upon. until the last of the (recently acquired) imacs reached end-of-life, they'd use citrix to load a windows terminal server desktop on each of the non-windows clients. seemed like a good idea, i guess... i was contracted to manage the transition from macos to windows. as it turned out, there were some troubles with the chosen combination of apple-citrix-windows terminal server. troubles which ended up causing serious troubles on the entire network - the citrix-client crapping itself the moment someone pressed a wrong button (1st gen imacs were notorious for this), printers not working properly and connections dropping due to ethernet broadcast storms. there were days where the entire company ground down to a screaching halt. needless to say, the employees were less then impressed with all this. but i managed to keep their spirits up with my comforting voice when they called the it-dept: "information department, this is sebbonl. how may i be of service?". so, it was a wednesday morning in september, and all hell was breaking loose. somebody pressed key "a" instead of "b", or maybe citrix had just crapped itself once more; maybe the moon had risen in virgo with saggitarius ascending, or maybe the gods were just in a particularly foul mood that day - whatever the reason might've been, the entire network had crapped itself and my co-workers were in the middle of rebooting the entire network. servers, routers, switches, everything. in the meanwhile, i was manning the phonelines and explaining the situation to our (irate) userbase. people were upset, of course, but i calmed them down, took their names and numbers and promised i'd be in touch the moment their department could resume working. i also spoke to a girl from a particular production team, telling her the outage was global and i'd be in touch the moment we had a resolution. her boss ("cunt" from here) wasn't having any of it, so he decided he'd call us himself. the conversation went something like this: me: "information department, this is sebbonl. how may i help you?" cunt: "are you a fucking retard?" me: "excuse me?" cunt: "i asked you a simple question. are you a fucking retard? are you aware that my entire team is currently unable to work?" me: "ehm, well..... we are aware of the problems, they seem to be global however. all production teams, as well as hrm and financials are unable to work right now. we're dowing the best we can, actually, but it may take about half an hour for the network te become available again." cunt: "that is unacceptable! you son of a whore! all of you it assholes are incompetent bastards who should be taken out and shot in the back of the neck!" now, i am familiar with vulgarities and insults, but i had never been spoken to in such a manner by a co-worker (of sorts). so, i begun losing my cool somewhat. me: "sir, please refrain from using insults. we're all in this together and this isn't helping. if you...." cunt, interrupting me: "what?! what?! are you trying to tell me what to do, you little fuck? i'll fuck your whore mother! clueless imbecile!" at this point, i really felt like returning the favour and lay into him. however, being an external contractor i felt this would've constituted a clear cla (career limiting action), so instead i responded by saying: "sir, i am no longer willing to continue this conversation in this manner. please give me your telephone number and i'll get my manager to call you." the cunt proceeded to give me his telephone number, an "06" number. in the nl, this indicates a mobile phone, still a relatively new thing at the time. but i still had to have a name: me: "thank you. so, who can i tell her she should call?" cunt: "&lt;b-list celebrity&gt;, off course!" indeed "of course"! like i said, most celebs were nice people. but as always, there must be one exception to the rule. cunt turned out to be a b-list tv-personality: a middle aged man widely known for being an obnoxious asshole. this prick started out as a papparazzo, got a celebrity gossip show on the tv and at the time my story takes place, he was foraying into investigative journalism - small time crime mostly. he was given a production team, a camera crew and sent out to produce his own take on crime stories, frequently getting his facts wrong and accusing completely innocent people of crimes they couldn't have commited. other times, he'd get his ass kicked due to him being an insufferable bastard to suspects, which is never a good idea. but hey, the ratings were good (to this day, i think because everyone liked seeing him getting beaten up by the "criminals" he confronted on a daily basis). he was known to be a drunk, a philanderer and, in general, one of the most hated people on dutch tv. and now it turned out it wasn't an act at all: this was just the type of person he was! it all made sense to me now.... me, saying: "ok, i will leave a notification on my manager's desk. she will be contacting you shortly.", but meaning: "i am sure she'll get round to contacting your sorry, obnoxious, insulting ass and adressing your trivial shit the moment she's done overseeing the people who are trying to get the entire goddamn fucking company back up and running." and hanging up. my co-worker (a bulgarian guy called stoyan) was looking at we funny. "what the fuck just happened, seb?". "trust me sto, you don't wanna know. i think i am taking the rest of the day off.". and with that, i pulled the call logs and forwarded these to my manager together with a report of what had happened &amp; request for a call-back and went home. the next day, business as usual. the day after that, my manager took me aside (thx, /u/jabadaba!). she had listened to the call, contacted the executives and indicated that the cunt should offer apologies for his behaviour. the executives had responded by saying that, while his behaviour was unacceptable, he couldn't be forced to offer apologies. instead, he had promised he wouldn't contact our department again - sending his requests through an intermediary from now on. so, tough shit sebbonl. just deal with it. fuck that. no fucking way this prick is getting away with this kind of bullshit. so, i went online. -&gt; register new adress -&gt; new message -&gt; to two or three guys i knew who also had a lot of friends. "hey guys.... you know who i am. i've got a fun message for ya. see this telephone number: 06-xxxxxxxx? dial it right now from a non-display caller telephone line and see who answers. see? that's &lt;b-list celebrity&gt;, who is well known for being an immoral asshole, frequently bothering people for no good reason whatsoever. remember the show where he rang the doorbell for 30 minutes, at night, at a house where three young kids were sleeping? do you remember the show where he spent an entire afternoon following and harassing a young mother, because her (ex!)-boyfriend supposedly cheated someone out of a few hundred bucks? well, let's see how he likes it! feel free to forward this message to as many people as possible." click "send". log on to the proxy server, delete the logs. delete the browser cache. log on to the router, drop the offending records from the logs. that's it. i'd erased my trails to the best of my abilities, and let's see what happens next. three days later, i receive a request in my inbox. it turns out that somehow, shitcunt's mobile number has been made public and he's being called 2500 times a day. could we please arrange for him to receive a new number? of course, i was forced to update my mass email and re-send it the moment a new number was assigned, making sure to leave a grace period of about a week each time. they never found out it was me. :) edit: typos and suchthis happened back in 2006 but it was such an awesome revenge that i still giggle when i think about it. we used to live in a cul-de-sac (a street with a dead end) with very little traffic. despite this, one guy decided that he was adamantly against anyone parking their car on the side of the road because he felt that it cheapened the look of the street and was going to lower his property values. (yeah, one of those guys). this guy decided that he was going to call a current affair about it - they are a really shitty australian "tv show" (put in quote marks because they're so bad) that tends to focus on fad diets, dodgy businesses, bad neighbours and things like that. [here is a link that explains exactly what it's like.]( they stopped my mum as she was leaving to go to work, and asked if they could interview her. she agreed but said she wanted to ring our next door neighbour, harold* (the bad neighbour lived on the other side of him and harold hated him). harold worked locally and quickly drove over so he could be interviewed as well. **the revenge:** harold was a news anchor for many, many years and knew how to control the media (knew what to say to turn them against bad neighbour). on camera, with bad neighbour smugly standing there watching, he started destroying this guy. claimed that many of the other residents in the street were afraid to leave the house in case this guy came and berated them. i can't remember exactly what else was said, but i do remember that part. mum said that she could see the aca people's eyebrows rising as harold went on. the next night, we watched the show to see what would happen. not only did they have footage of the bad neighbour marching down the street set to the imperial march from star wars but they'd put in all these interviews (which they must have gotten afterwards) from people at the local council saying how this guy had been harassing them for months, and then footage of the guy doing stuff like cutting back someone else's plants because they were hanging over the footpath (just barely!) and therefore a "violation", and an interview with him where he said he'd had to ring several other councils because the local one had stopped taking his calls, as well as the police! in short, they revealed him to be exactly the crackpot he was instead of doing what he'd hoped (portraying him as some kind of crusader of justice fighting against the evil neighbours). bad neighbour ended up complaining to media watch about the whole thing, which meant that the episode got aired again... and finally moved away because everyone was laughing at him so much. tl;dr: shitty neighbour tries to use the media to get his way, ex-journalist neighbour manages to turn them against him. *name changedrepost from tifu. it got removed, but i decided to post it here instead since it actually makes me feel better talking about it to people. throwaway because i don't want this haunting me. like most tifus this didn't happen today. it happened back in middle school in the late 90's. it was 5th grade. i was a scrawny little nerd, i wasn't exactly a social person, i mostly held to myself playing pokémon in te back corner of the caféteria. and since this was a small town in texas i was definitely the weird kid in class, and because of this i got bullied. a lot. most of the glass was apart of the bullying, but there was one kid in particular that did most of it. i'll call the kid james. because that's his name. james used to push me into lockers, call me names and make the whole class laugh at me. he was a textbook bully. most people would probably maybe tell a teacher, parents or maybe they would try to fight back. i didn't even think of that though. all i could think of was sweet, sweet revenge. now, this couldn't just be your everyday put gum in the hair revenge. no, this had to be reeeaall pro-revenge. i decided to make his family's already bad financial situation worse by making him get addicted to smoking. it would be hard. i couldn't just go and shove a cigarette into his mouth and hope not to be beaten, no. i had to infiltrate his life and ruin it from within! over the next few months i was slowly starting to be nice to him. i helped him with his homework, shared jokes with him, i even gave him some of my precious pokémon cards! by 7th grade i had become his best friend. had i not had my mind clouded with hate i'd see that james was mean because of a lot of things. he was insecure, his home life awful and above all he had been jealous of me. i however did not see this. i had infiltrated his life and it was now time to destroy it. over a few months i started smoking (i thought that it was worth it since you had to make some sacrifices for revenge.) and then i offered james some. he was reluctant at first, but after some persuasion he caved in and tried it. much like a drug dealer i gave james his first couple of packs for free. but after he had become addicted i told him that he'd have to get his own. james did everything as planned. at first he smoked 2 packs a month. then it became a pack a week. until finally he smoked a pack a day. james was addicted for real now. my plan had worked flawlesly. james stole money constantly from his father and he even had to get a job to pay for his addiction. james grew anxious and angry every second he didn't light it up. i had gotten my revenge. but was i happy? we were now in grade 10 and i had finally realized what a great person james really was. i knew what i had done was horrible, so i tried to stop him from his addiction. i flushed down his cigarettes, i hid them. i even took away his money so he couldn't buy his death sticks. this was all in vain however since he in grade 11 started smoking 2 packs a day. during the next 7 years me and james grew closer and closer. i was the best man on his wedding and he was at mine. hell, i even witnessed his sons get born. i still couldn't forgiven myself how cruel i was when we were kids and i constantly tried to get him to quit the cigarettes. "think of your kids." i said "do you want to witness them graduate, marry and have your grandchildren?" this worked. james went down from atleast 2 packs a day to 1 pack a week again. it was very hard for him, but he made it. james was after 9 years completely cigarette free. james, me and his wife were ecstatic about this. i was so proud of him. however, this happiness didn't last very long. james was diagnosed with stage 2 adenocarcinoma lung cancer. the cancer got worse and he died 9 months after the diagnosis. it's now exactly 5 years after his death and his family is still suffering from the consequences. i try to help them as much as possible, but since i had to quit my job due to depression it's not a lot i can do financial wise. i constantly think about my mistakes. how james would be alive right now if it wasn't for me. how his sons wouldn't have to grow up without their dad, how his wife wouldn't cry herself to sleep every night. james was so much better than me and just because he was mean to me as a kid i had to fucking kill him? i constantly think about killing myself. but i can't. his family needs me. the family that was robbed from their dad because of me. if i killed myself it would make things even worse. so to close things up. tl;dr i killed my best friend because of a petty revenge.so i work on trees, and sometimes i have to do blocks and blocks of trees near the street, when this happens i put up all the correct signage which is usually a "men in trees" sign, and a few lane closed ahead sign. my crew works pretty fast and safe. well everyday when we would take lunch we would be sitting under a tree eating our lunch. its much faster and efficient for us to just leave the work zone up while we are eating. well one day this asshat decided it would be funny to start running over our cones in the taper [thats the row of cones that starts from the curb and goes at an angle to try to force people into one lane]. this started on a monday and everyday, asshat would come by and run over our cones and laugh at us, while we are all sitting down taking lunch. so one of us would have to walk a few blocks to go retrieve the cones, it basically fucked our lunch and work zone up. well come wednesday i had enough, i went to my local hardware store and bought a few 80 pound bags of quick-crete, and some "great stuff" spray foam, i took two of the cones home filled the top two inches of the cones with the foam, and went and had a beer while it dried. then proceeded to mix up the quick-crete into the cones. i let it sit overnight. the next morning i realized that i mixed it too wet and it would have to dry another day. i was kinda upset thinking that i would miss my revenge. sure enough asshat came again. so friday. i take the cones to work and set up the work zone, first two cones are normal then the two concrete filled cones. lunch time, asshat drives by and the whole crew is watching, he notices and gets going extra fast knowing that he has our attention. first two cones... then... first concrete cone dents his bumper pretty good,goes under the tire then gets stuck in the wheel well. but soon falls out about the time he goes over the second cone, hits his car smashes up the bumper and he drives over it. he speeds off pretty quick most likely thinking wtf just happened. he was in such a hurry, he didnt notice his oil pan got ripped off.... enjoy your "hopefully" locked up engine. **edit 1 ok first off this was on a low volume street, if it wasnt low volume, we would have closed the street down completely and detoured people around, its much safer for us. yeah i could have gotten shit canned for having the cones like that, yeah someone could have gotten hurt, but i was much younger and was pissed. usually we leave a giant chuck of wood in the work zone to discourage that anymore. that being said, fuck that guy i used to try to leave nice workzones for traffic, now we just close it off 3 days before, and detour everyone around, and tow any car parked on the street.** for everyone that called bullshit, well whatever, but i am a very active poster in two tree related subs so you can at least know that.mandatory this happened several years ago. so, i'm not a fan of bathrooms here in the states. there is like a foot of clearance between the stall and the floor and an inch on the sides of the door. i worked at a target at one point in my life. i used to work pretty early in the morning, so on my first break id usually drink a huge can of monster energy drink. i didnt like the urinals at my work, they were like right next to eachother with no divider. so i usually used the stalls to pee. well, this little brat decided to crawl under my stall. kid was like 5 so there is no excuse. he crawled under there and turned up to look at me with his mouth wide open. i fucked up and panicked. without thinking about it, i started peeing on him. he sat there for a good minute and a half it seemed, then got up and ran out of the bathroom. i slipped out behind him while he was talking to his mom outside the bathroom about what happened. when she finally did understand what the kid was saying and why he was sogging wet, you could tell she was on the war path and went into the mens bathroom on the hunt for the suspected perp. needless to say i non challantly as possible walked away and spent most the rest of the day hiding in the meat cooler. serves him right for crawling under my stall.my wife recently started a job at the check-in desk at a downtown 5 star hotel. one of her shift supervisors is a relatively young lebenese guy, lets call him douche nozle (dn). dn is a typical jersey shore looking wannabe. he's got greasy hair, immaculately groomed 3 day growth and tanned skin. the funny thing is he is also pudgy and overweight so the whole look just comes across as sad. i've met him a few times and he is smarmy, arrogant and treats his staff like shit. anyway, from day 1 he started hitting on my wife. he initially sent her a text, explaining that he lifted her number from the hr file as he was a 'dedicated leader' and wanted to 'look after his team'. he texted her pretty much before and after every shift, asking her to lunch before hand or drinks afterwards in order to 'explain the sytem to her'. these texts later devolved to telling her to 'sleep well and lots so you can be fully refreshed at work' explaining that he wanted her looking 'angelic like you always do'. anyway, there is tons of this random crap and he is always calling her pet names like 'babe', 'angel' or 'sexy'. my wife tried to keep it professional in her replies but it was quite clear this dn wasn't going to stop. she also always wears both her engagement ring and wedding band so there is no excuse. to put this story into context, i am a current serving army officer. as a platoon commander who has led soldiers in afghanistan i would say that i know a thing or two about leadership. so he's claim that he was just being a 'dedeciated leader' just seemed pathetic. i wanted to straight out punch this dude in the face, schoolyard style, but my wife calmed me down as she didn't want to start trouble at her new job and as a supervisor, dn could technically assign her the crappy shifts. two weeks ago, my wife asked me to go pick her up from work, that way, she could introduce me to dn and rest of the desk clerks as her husband. i went straight after my work so i was in full uniform and arrived about 10 mins before her shift ended. i walked straight up to him and introduced myself to dn. i towered a foot above him and gave him my hardest bone cruncher handshake. my voice was friendly but my eyes were like a hawk, 'g'day dn, my wife told me all about you. she is saying how you are a great leader and always looks after her team'. he reddened, mumbled something about being busy and walked way. i stared at him all the way as he exited the room, my wife and the rest of her team all burst out laughing. pathetic. a few days after this incident, my wife gets an email from dn with upper management cc'd. dn works with her everyday so the only reason why he would send her an email in lieu of just telling her would be because he wanted her to get into trouble from the bosses. the email explained that employees are forbidden from having personal visits during work hours as it might reflect badly on the hotel. if she was to have someone pick her up that i should wait in the loading area at the back of the hotel. what the fuck! i was super pissed now. again, the wife calmed me down and told me to forget it (i love her, but she can be annoyingly professional sometimes!). so i sat down and plotted revenge with my 4 of my army mates during our weekly drinking session. we decided that the revenge should be subtle and not traceable to me (this rules out physically harming him). we then came up with a series of events that would screw with him a period of 4 days. mind you i did this all while keeping my wife out of it (she would not approve!). 1. my mates and i went to a internet cafe and spent three hours signing up his work email address to all number of 'strange' websites from all corners of the internet. from gay dating, to armadillo appreciation, anything and everything. somethings we say i will never be able to erase from my memory (the raw internet is a horrible place children). 2. we surveilled him from when left work and tailed him to his house (it wasn't hard as we had his shifts courtesy of my wife). after acquiring his address we waited till dead in the middle of the night, sneaked into yard, jacked his car up and placed all four tyres up a tree he had in his front yard. let him puzzle that one out. 3. finally, my friends and i called hotel management independently six times at varying intervals, pretended we were guests and complained that we saw dn behind the counter looking at inappropriate stuff on the internet. i feigned disinterest when my wife came home excitingly telling me that dn was late for work as someone had removed his tyres and that management had come to ask him a few questions but seized his computer instead when he wasn't there and were going through his emails. a few days later dn had being demoted and moved to a different location across town (3 star motel owned by the same corporation). i've never told my wife my involvement. tldr: fuck with an army officer's wife, get demoted and moved across town. edit: corrected for grammar and spelling. this is a story that happened on my drive home about half an hour ago. the smell of justice still hangs in the air. i'm driving down this quiet one-lane residential street. playground zone, but it's 10:30pm, so i'm doing 5 over the speed limit of 40 (kms). all of a sudden, some putz comes flying down the road behind me, stopping mere inches from my bumper. i mean, i couldn't even see his headlights anymore, and i drive a smallish car. i just wanted to get home, not into an accident, so i moved over into the "parking lane." there's not two lanes there, but at this time of night, there was nobody else on the road, and i was driving in the gravel at the side of the road. this guy had more than ample room to pass me if he wanted. \&gt;nope.jpg this paragon of driving etiquette follows me over, still so close that i can't see his headlights. well shit. what now? i keep rolling along, and see my salvation in the distance: [the saddest, most useless piece of curbing i've ever laid eyes on. - actual picture]( i keep driving along towards this thing, drawing ever nearer. my palms are getting sweaty. my eyes are darting back and forth from the i-want-to-be-a-real-curb and my rearview mirror. i have a very small window. all my training, my years of experience, have led me to this moment. i either go home a hero, or not at all. i wait till the last possible second, and swerve back into the lane proper. doucher mcgee back there just didn't have the time to react. what followed was possibly the most satisfying series of sounds i'll ever hear. i watched in my mirror as his front end hit the curb at 45. his bumper was immediately ripped off (don't lower your rides, kids!). his car jumped up onto the curb, and devoured the unsuspecting sign as a dolphin would swallow a fish. a final glance back as i turned the corner a few hundred meters ahead rewarded me with the glorious sight of smoke pouring out from under his hood. \&gt;[mfw](this story is a from almost 2 years back but i just found this subreddit and thought it would be a good story. (with video) also note, this story uses kph because this is in colombia. it was sept 2011 and i was driving my nissan in a quiet residential area. i approached an intersection that was rather notorious for people disregarding the stop sign. i have the right of way as streets going either north or south usually do. i was going 40kph and i look right as i'm about to cross the intersection and i see a big mercedes suv hauling ass just meters away from the intersection (easily 60-70kph). i see a cellphone by her ear. she sees my car and brakes to around 30-40kph. crash. my car even hit the sidewalk with enough force to lift the entire right side away from the ground. i am shocked and a little bruised, and literally crying 10 seconds after the crash (i love my car). she drives away 10 seconds later. as a first (but small) victory for me, a cab driver that saw the crash (can be seen on the far right edge, after the crash) turns around and chases her and brings her back. my family and some friends arrive to help me (uncles are lawyers) while the cop and the respective insurance lawyers sort everything out. this lady driving the mercedes and her husband threaten us, "you're going to be screwed out of insurance" "watch your bank accounts" etc. the traffic cop was bribed by them (we saw her husband giving him money) and drew the accident's sketch incorrectly. my uncles not-so-kindly proceed to point out this error. sketch is corrected, and they didn't like that we noticed (second victory). cop asks both parties to sign off the report (i don't sign it, you'll know why). we leave. my car was towed as it was undriveable, and her car was never even present at the scene of the accident after the accident itself. fast forward two days later, a friend suggests "you know, the building in front of where you crashed has to have surveillance footage..." bingo (third victory). we go, ask, get the video, and take it to her insurance and our insurance company. now, the reason i didn't sign the accident report was because in her statement she claimed i was speeding, going the wrong way, and that i attacked her car. lying to the insurance company is grounds for cancellation. on top of that, my dad found out both the cars they had (the mercedes and a bmw) are leased. my dad is friends with the owner of the lease company. he handed over everything. a week later we get the call that they took both cars back (cause they were used). (fourth victory) a month after the accident, i get my car back as good as new. the cost of repair was greater than the value of the car! (biggest victory!) but it was fixed because my dad is also friends with the owner of nissan in colombia. he told the insurance company (friends as well), "don't let this car get totalled, he loves this car". and that is how i got my great revenge on the person who i hate most in this life. the video, if anyone wants to watch it, is here (accident at 0:30) ps: we also investigated them. got their address, names, kids' names, where they go to school, what they do for a living, everything. long story short they have stolen a lot of money from the state thanks to shady businesses they run. edit: the reason i refused to let my car go was because at the time, it was a 14 year old (1997) nissan sentra with 45,000 miles/74,000 kilometers. i inherited the car from my grandfather and i love it to death.so my grandpa had a long going fued with his older brother. for some context, his older brother kidnapped their mother from her nursing home, hid her in florida, and had her change her will to only include him, to the exclusion of her three other children. first, my grandpa's brother took control of the house my grandparents lived in (that was his parents) and the business they had operated for 15 years (their business, on land owned by his parents). my grandpa offered to buy the property from his brother, but got the response "i'll sell it to you over my dead body." grandpas brother showed up with a cooler and lawn chair to watch as they were forced to move out. so my grandpa got a friend of his (jim) to buy the property. after the sale went through grandpa's brother handed jim the keys...and jim motioned to my grandpa who was hiding around the corner to come and get the keys. grandpas brother was furious! many years later my grandpa is driving around with his son in law (my dad) when he runs over a skunk. he comes up with a great plan, heads home, and ties a milk crate to his bumper. grandpa puts the skunk in the crate, goes home and kisses his wife goodbye and tells her "i'll be back in a few days". he made a 24 hour drive to florida, dumped the skunk in his brothers convertible, and makes the drive home. when my grandpa died, he had a newspaper clipping in his wallet headlined "phony bomb defused". apparently "someone", while on vacation in florida, strapped some railroad flares to an alarm clock and tossed it under grandpas brothers trailer. just to start off i suck at telling stories and i just want to tell this story while it's fresh in my mind. when my dad was still in the military, he was in charge of a group of soldiers. one of them was a female who he said probably had mental issues. he has no idea how she even got in, but she did. this female soldier befriended another soldier. because of her issues, she trusted him without question very quickly.. eventually she trusted him to drive her car and get some money out of the atm for her. this little shit took her car, completely emptied her account and then went awol. now this girl was about to leave the army due to her issues, and that money was all she had to help her once she was out, so she was devastated. they eventually found the guy and he was brought before my dad since my dad was his superior officer. now i'm not entirely sure why, but they wouldn't just straight up arrest him and send him to fill sandbags in the texas heat at the base's jail. my dad said something about the legal process takes awhile for a chapter 10 or something like that. in other words, the civilian police couldn't arrest him since he was under military jurisdiction, and the military couldn't do anything because it was being investigated or processed. so anyway, my dad couldn't find a way to send him to the jail, and this guy is all cocky like “i don't regret it one bit, she's just stupid for letting me have access. not my fault she's stupid. etc etc”. my dad was looking for any way to punish this guy until he found out the most borderline illegal thing he could. he ended up going to the guy, still sitting there with this smirk on his face and my dad said “well since you don't show any remorse and i can't send you to fill up sandbags, here what you're gonna do. i got a job for you, your job is to sit in this tiny room and make sure the paint doesn't peel.” no one could talk to him, he would leave to eat (he ate in an isolated room facing the corner) and to go the bathroom. that was it. also my dad was only required to give him 4 hours of sleep. so he could leave the room at midnight and at 4 in the morning he was woken up to make sure that paint didn't peel. my dad even decided to have some fun with him. one day he went in and said “i feel like being nice today, i'm gonna let you read today's paper”. the guy was overjoyed at the prospect of getting to read the newspaper, all he had done was stare at a wall and didn't even know what was going on in the outside world. right as he started to read my dad took it away immediately and said, “actually, never mind, you're stupid. can't believe you trusted me.” then left again. after a few days the guy couldn't take it. he called his attorney and begged for him to find a way to send him to the base's jail so he could fill sandbags instead of staring at a wall making sure the paint doesn't peel. but attorney couldn't find a way to make it happen. eventually they were able to discharge him from the army. my dad's 2nd in command had to escort him to the front gate to officially release him. what the jackass didn't know was the civilian police were finally able to get a warrant for his arrest for stealing that poor girls money. so the whole drive, this cocky guy is like “yup soon i'll be out and i can tell you how i feel about you yadda yadda” and the 2nd in command is like “yup, you can say whateeeeeeeeeever you want”. when they got to the gate they released him and the 2nd in command is like, “well you're out of the army now, you can say whatever you want”. the jackass opens his mouth to speak but the 2nd in command goes, “wait, just one more thing, gentleman, this is the man.” and the two civilian cops who had been waiting out front immediately put him in cuffs. my dad's 2nd in command leaned in to the guys face and said “have a nice fuckin day.” then laughed his ass off. tl;dr: soldier steals another soldiers life savings, my dad makes him sit in a room making sure the paint doesn't peel until he can be discharged and arrested by civilian police. like i said i really suck at telling stories and remembering details. i don't even remember what i had for breakfast yesterday. if you need anything clarified leave it in the comments and i'll go ask my dad. i think that would be better than making him retell the entire story to me while i type.my wife works for a national chain of home improvement stores and brings her lunch with her to work daily including bottled water to drink while she eats. when she gets to work she stashes all the consumables in the refrigerator in the break room. we live down south (usa) and last july was extremely hot. i'm talking over 100 degrees f. for 3 days in a row my wife's water bottles were just disappearing between the time she got to work and meal time. obviously, someone (other then my wife [love you sweetheart]) thought they were too good to drink from the water fountain. i can only assume it was someone working the un-air-conditioned garden center that was extremely thirsty and couldn't resist the cold water. after the second day i recommended a revenge plan which my wife shot down due to it possibly putting her job in jeopardy. after the third day she agreed. i looked up a video on youtube on how to open water bottles without breaking the seal. for those who are interested: anyway the plan was to refill the water bottles with vinegar. i filled 2 water bottles with vinegar and left 1 alone. i put a little mark on the water bottle so she would know which one was still good to drink. she went to work and set the trap. when she came back into the break room for lunch one of the vinegar bottles was gone from the refrigerator. on the other side of the room there was a liquid all over the floor- like someone had walked into the break room all hot and sweaty, saw the magical chilled beverages that always appeared and chugged and spewed vinegar!! while we never did find out who was stealing the water it hasn't happened since and just imagining what i just described above has been very satisfying for me. hahahha! edit: thanks for all the replies. some users are calling it fake or posted in the wrong sub. not fake. i found this sub yesterday and decided to post a time i got revenge. figured i'd share my idea of a good laugh :)i'm from london and take buses and trains nearly everywhere. i had some driving lessons when i turned 17 but i never passed, my heart wasn't in it, so while i can drive, i am not a licensed driver. this particular bus i'm on heading west is headed for heathrow and is a very long single decker. there's a point on the route where a brick wall flanks a very tight curve, the bus needs to edge through there and nearly everyone knows the spot is tricky and give some space to the many bus routes that come through here. this airport shuttle is so long it need to be extra careful and i always commend the drivers who make it look effortless. about **4 or 5 miles later** i've alighted at my stop and am a few steps away when i hear commotion. a woman has pulled up on the driver's side of the bus, at a 45 degree angle to block the bus. [i drew it]( - remember we drive on the left here, he needs to pull out to the right. total grade a dick move. she is screaming at the driver that he "cut her up" back at the dodgy walled corner. she's demanding his driver id and plate, which she could take herself because its there for anyone to see. the driver didn't cut her up, she likely just didn't have patience and got pissed while he took the corner. he's rightfully refusing to give her the time of day and quite politely insists she stop blocking the bus, there's about 30 people on board with places to go. some passengers are telling her she's being outrageous as well. i have ceased walking and remain because i'm not afraid of pushy selfish people. she didn't even shut her driver side door or take her keys with her, so i get in and drive ahead a bit, it's now parked at the end of the bus stop so it's not blocking the bus nor any traffic. i get out and see the bus driver shout "cheers mate" and he all but flattens her as he swiftly takes off to continue his route. now that she can't berate him she tries to get in my face but i'm much taller than her anyway and put headphones on and continue walking. better still, my walk takes me onto a road which you can't enter by car from her way, it's one way slip onto her road so she couldn't follow me even if she had the balls she wants everyone to think she's got. if she was clever she'd have taken his plate herself but she missed her chance and will now never be able to report her grievance to the bus company. **tl;dr** a madwoman blocked a bus that i just alighted from so that she could shout at the driver, but let her door open and engine running so i moved it for her and the bus and my fellow passengers could get on their* way edited a word edit 2: whoa i went to bed and this got popular! and for science. [streetview]( / [imgur]( of the dodgy walled sectiona fun story for you all. when i was young (highschool age), i lived with my family in a middle-upper class suburb. everybody in the community got along, and for the most part, life there was quiet, peaceful, and enjoyable. that is of course, for one major exception of the house next to mine, which was rented by mr public nuisance ($pn). be it drug/alcohol fueled parties, drug busts, and constant eviction notices, there was rarely more than a week that went by without some sort of police involvement. to put $pn into perspective, he would have failed to get a job being a dirtbag, simply because he was overqualified. one fateful night however, the neighborhood got even. it was about 11pm on a spring night. myself and family are attempting to sleep, however the party bumping from the other side of the fence is making sleep, or even clear thought all but impossible. police had already been called, volumes had been turned down, then turned back up again as soon as the police car had pulled around the corner. i crawled out of bed and made my way out to the living room. the front door was open, and my father was standing out front, in conference with the neighborhood pajama committee. they dispersed and my father came back inside. i asked him what was happening. &gt;"just be quiet and follow me." i followed my father out of the house into the back yard, where he opened up the valves for our hoses; they bulged under the pressure. he handed me one of the nozzles and whispered "on my command" we both walked over to the fence and took aim. my father waited, checking his watch, until finally, his arm dropped. streams of water appeared from all around, and jettisoned into $pn's yard. sounds of drunken partying turned to screams of shock. now would probably be a good time to note that the neighborhood water supply was winter runoff, which usually sat just above freezing temperatures. in the cool spring air, it was probably quite uncomfortable. screams of shock were eventually overpowered by a yell of rage. $pn had lost it, and was screaming half slurred expletives. we shut the water off, and somebody yelled back "sorry, thought it was the dog!" a few minutes later, the neighborhood pajama committee had re-communed, and were giggling among each other. $pn was standing in the nude in front of his house continuing a to yell at the top of his lungs. at that moment, a police car pulled around the corner. long story short, $pn was taken to jail on charges of providing alcohol to minors, indecent exposure, lewd acts with a girl under the age of 18, and a slew of other alcohol/drug charges. he plead guilty to many of the charges, and evaded jail-time, however because he now had a record of sexual assault, he was forced to move away from our community, and the many schools that were nearby.when i was 7 or 8 (i cant remeber it was 20 years ago) i set up a lemonade stand a quarter for a cup in my drive way with my friend and neighbor kaz at the time. anyways there was a 10 year old bastard name tim who kept coming over taking the pitcher drinking from it and then dumping what was left in the grass called us names like penis lickers and fart monkeys or some such. he did this 3 days in a row. well on the 4th day my mom had chicken thawing out in the sink in some water and i always remember her saying if you touch the water wash your hands or youll get sick. so i got my pitcher and filled it with the chicken water. so this young hitler douchebag comes over not 10 minutes after we had made the lemonade and he does his thing. anyways a few days later hes taken in to the hospital with severe food poisoning caused by me and hes there for a week. thats my revenge storythis is a tale i've told plenty of people before, but never had the chance to share it on reddit. when i was in middle school, there was a guy named joshua who was a real prick. he and his two cronies would go around in stereotypical fashion and pick on anyone who was dorky, different looking, poor, et cetera. unfortunately, as a white nerd in flushing, ny with a single mother, i fit all the requirements. now, lunch money wasn't really that big- most people were either on an official lunch plan or brown bagged it on the daily (i was the latter). and so, joshua proceeded to steal my lunch from me, day after day after day. of course, being ~~a little bitch~~ a fresh-faced youth, i went and told the teachers. but i was always met with answers like "just sit somewhere else" (really? he comes to *me*, lady), "tell him it's not his lunch" (gee, what a novel concept!), or my personal favorite, "his friends said that you gave your food to him." now, at this particular middle school, "wite-out" was banned, apparently because some kids had been found sniffing it behind the bleachers (we're talking about 11-13 year olds in this school, people). it was this that gave me my perfect idea. the next day i had graham crackers in my lunch. before the period started, i brought my lunch into the bathroom, along with a half-full bottle of wite-out i'd swiped from my mother's desk. i took the little brush and liberally applied the odorous chemical to the graham crackers. i'd like to pause for a moment and say that i imagined, in my idealist 11-year-old mind, that he would see the graham crackers slathered with white and reeking of wite-out and say, "darn! i can't eat this! my master plan, foiled!" or something of the sort. needless to say, little joshua stole my lunch again that day. i chuckled to myself, thinking of how he'd curse my name when he discovered the best part of the lunch had been made inedible. later that day, i was called into the assistant principal's office. apparently, little joshua had left class with a stomachache- and was currently en route to the hospital getting his stomach pumped! long story short, i got five days in-school suspension, joshua missed school for a week, and he never went after my lunch again. oh, and the best part: *he thought it was icing!*i worked as a security guard downtown in a large canadian city. this story starts when i got a phone call from one of the other guards working. he found a contractor had parked and left a truck in a loading dock bay, and was inquiring if i knew anything about it. the site i worked at had 2 buildings, over 60 floors between them, and that shared a loading dock with only 3 spaces. occasionally on an expected slower day contractors could ask us to leave a vehicle there if they were doing a quick job, but it was infrequent, as the the loading dock was really busy. around this time there was a company who had just rented 2 or 3 floors and there was a massive remodel going on there. people were in and out constantly and the job was going to run for a few months. this made the loading dock bays busy enough that we weren't letting anyone park there, just unload. i had been there that day and no one had asked permission to park, and nothing had been passed on from other guards or property management. i told the guard as much, and he went to find the contractor to have the vehicle moved. about half an hour later, as i am patrolling, i hear my guard arguing with someone near the building control center. as i approached i picked up this was an argument about the truck. the contractor was saying that they had been given permission to park there. i walked up and explained that there were only 2 people on site that day that could have given permission, i was one of them and worked with the other for half the day, and we didn't give anyone permission to park there. he needed to move the vehicle. the contractor left at that point and i thought the issue was settled. about 15 minutes later i was covering a break in the control room when the foreman of the contract company, who is also the owner of the truck, approached and told me that they had been promised parking and aren't going to move the truck. i again politely explained to him that he didn't have permission, and that the truck needed to move as we needed the loading dock space. he then proceeded to yell at me, call me worthless, explained how he was so much more important than i was, how he made my yearly salary in a month, and most importantly he wasn't moving the truck and he would get me fired if i kept "harassing" him. as i started to respond, he just turned and walked away, as he was too busy to bother with me. i was furious. it's bad enough to be a disrespecting asshole, but to also threaten my job was too far. i followed after them and asked them really quickly what company they were with, got the company name and left them alone. i went back to the control center, and called the company. i explained who i was, that the truck was illegally parked, that the contractor threatened to have me fired for asking him to move the truck, and that he refused to speak with me about the issue, as he was worth too much to bother with a lowly security guard. we spoke for a few minutes as she apologized and asked me what i wanted to happen. i just asked that the contractor be spoken with, as that level of disrespect is unacceptable, and lastly the truck had to be moved. pretty quickly the truck was moved and the night supervisor for the 3 floor build came and apologized. the contractors were friends of his, he had given them permission to park there as they were helping out for the next few weeks on the job. he paid to park the truck himself and it cost over $150 to park just for the night in the closest lot. he didn't come across as actually apologetic at all, more a guy doing damage control for his friends. this is where the revenge gets pro ($150 in parking is petty at best). the next day i ran into one of the contractors i was on great terms with. we would often talk for a while when we could. he explained that he was the lead for the entire build on the project, which i hadnt realized previously. i thought he was just one of the regular guys. he spoke with the night supervisor and heard about the issue, chewed out the night supervisor for handling the situation so poorly, fired the subcontractors from the job and blacklisted them from ever doing business with them again. the main contractor company was a huge company that is constantly doing work with the property management company, who own around a third of all the major buildings in that city, and similar amounts in most of the other big canadian cities. not a company you want a bad reputation with. had a neighbor many years ago with a pack of chihuahuas that they didn't take care of much other than to feed them. yappy little fuckers would crap all over my yard and run over snarling and growling, snapping at your heels just trying to get in the door from the car. they'd run up the steps and try to follow you in going ape shit the whole time. i knew the neighbors knew because i saw them watching with smirks. tried to kick the little shit bombs but they stayed just out of range. animal control did jack squat about it. finally i took a shovel and started flicking all of the dog poop onto their roof. after several weeks of it building up, it rained. the literal shit storm that ensued was like rotten gravy train pouring over the sides. the dad was cussing and yelling trying to dodge his family onto the porch out of the diarrhea rain when they got home. much glee was had. the dogs stayed in their back yard after. tl;dr: neighbors house rained dog shit upon them. this occurred in my second year of university, i opted to live in the dorm again, in an apartment style dorm room. i had three roommates: apple, orange and melon. * apple- apple was clever. she refused to stop smoking weed, but knew the university had a heavy fine for being caught smoking legal or illegal, so she mainly squatted at her dealer's apartment and i had no problem with that. * orange- she was from a very small town, was easily intimidated and simply wanted to be left alone. we get alone just fine. * melon- melon was the problem. when you applied to the dorms, you checked off what you liked and disliked in terms of noise level/study habits and guests. apple, orange, and i all wanted quiet, no guests and we all took school very seriously. melon wrote the same thing on her application, but that was a lie. she wanted to party and she wanted to party hard. it started with her leaving her room for days at a time, and not turning off her laptop, which played an adhan (muslim call to prayer) 5 times a day and had to be shut off manually. at first, it wasn't bothersome, everyone makes mistakes and a quick call to the ra and she came down, keys in hand and turned it off. but, it began happening 5 days a week and finally, i complained that this was driving me insane. melon was given orders to fix the problem, she turned the function off. cleanliness: there were 2 bathrooms to a dorm room and apple and i shared, so i basically had my own bathroom, and orange and melon shared. orange tried once to ask melon to clean the bathroom and melon snapped and began screaming at her, threatening her and this began the bullying (i didn't learn about this for months). revenge the first: i walked into the dorm room and smelled pot. i checked apple's room, since she openly admitted to smoking and she was squatting still. orange wasn't in and that left one person. i put my ear to the door and heard a large group of people and turns out, melon decided to have a 'pot party', fully knowing that the 4 of us agreed to have no smoking at all. the fine was huge, and i hate the smell of any smoke. i casually walked down to the ra's room and told her i smelled smoke from melon's room and i had some papers ra needed to sign anyway, so why not come to my room and sign the papers. ra comes, smells smoke, opens door and finds the smoking and melon is busted with a 600$ fine. revenge the second: melon liked friends, and she liked having her friends over. but never at reasonable times, she would invite her friends over at 3-4am, during midterms, finals and they'd be loud. i got sick of this immediately and i tried asking melon to have people over when her roommates weren't sleeping. she told me to "go fuck myself" and if i wasn't having people over at 3-4am, i must have no friends. not sure about that logic. so, after she invited a bunch of guys over who began yelling to each other about what food to order, i got my revenge. she left her keycard on the table and these cards had to be swiped to get into the building and your personal room. the first time, i simply de-magnetised the card and the second time, i threw the card away. a replacement card cost 40$ this wasn't working, so i came up with a better plan: i de-magnetized the new card so when she tried to come into the dorm room at 3am with a bunch of drunk assholes, the card didn't work and she began banging on the door and rattling the knob. this time i called the ra and security and said i thought someone was breaking in. caught with a bunch of drunks that early and with that level of noise cost her 150$ in fines. revenge the third: no animals were allowed in the dorm. i was hearing scratching noises and i was worried about mice or rats (melon was filthy in terms of food disposal and storage) and i knew she wasn't home but she'd propped her door open. i poked my head in and lo and behold, there is a rodent of some sort (gerbil or hamster) in a massive cage. i got pissed off because there carpet had urine and faeces on it and i'm fairly sure that urine and faecal matter probably could carry some sort of disease. i closed the door and called ra and said there was a scratching in our room and i was worried about rodents. ra came and opened apple's door, finding nothing. my room had nothing and orange's room had nothing. but melon had a rodent! that was a 500$ fine for the animal and something else for carpet cleaning. i think melon began to get suspicious of me, i always made sure that it was other people busting her and i always planned things well. if she did, she never tried anything. but i was unaware that melon was taking her anger out on orange. i liked orange a lot, she was sweet, shy and could not be mean if she tried. i was writing an essay once and i heard noise that was louder than my headphones and i slid them off and heard melon screaming and threatening orange. i opened my door and saw orange in the corner, crying and trying to ball up and melon was standing over her just shrieking, i called the ra (for non nefarious purposes!) and grabbed orange and let the ra restrain melon. this time a big meeting was called and orange spilled everything: melon was stealing toiletries from her, eating orange's food etc etc. the rules were set: * no guests in the room from 9pm to 9am (melon was furious) * melon had to pay orange for the toiletries and food * melon was told that one more toe out of line would incur a massive fine * we were all told to basically stay away from each other * when final exam time came, no guests period. for anyone. i felt really guilty that i never knew what orange was going through, i apologized a lot and i kept watch. my last revenge: at this point, we were getting close to the end of the school year and melon's parents were calling a lot and were furious at the amount of money she had accrued in fines. and i really thought she was going to stop being such an asshole, but i was wrong. melon decided to blow off some of her final exams (genius!) and have a bunch of friends come over. they came over at 4am and tried to have a 'quiet' party. i woke up because i heard glass breaking on the floor and vodka began seeping under my door. i had an exam in the afternoon. i did not need this shit. melon knocked on my door and i feigned sleep and when i heard her say "don't worry, she's not home" i called the ra and let the hammer fall. her parents were called and they apologized to orange and i and i'm not sure what the final fine was. she had planned to spend her third year of university in the dorms again, but the ra was so frustrated with her asshole behaviour, she wrote a letter to the head of the board and said that letting her back into the dorms would be a huge mistake. the last time i saw her, her parents were loading her shit into a van and she waved at me and it hit me. i don't think she really knew it was me. the whole year, every time she got busted, every fine was because of me. there is something very pleasurable about anonymous revenge, i'm not sure how to explain it. tl;dr: over the span of one year, i made sure that my roommate was fined for every asshole thing she did. she does not know it was me.this story is a little old, taking place around 2000 or so. anyways during that summer, there was a rash of punks who would go and vandalize houses, cars, and pretty much anything else they could do to raise hell. it was so bad that they would keep stealing the hub caps off of my fathers grand national as well as try and get in to steal the radios and change. he was forced to keep it unlocked as it was cheaper then them breaking the windows. the police would always take their sweet time getting here. it would take 20 minutes or more to send one officer here, even though i could walk to the station in that amount of time. by then they kids would have run off and gotten away. my father is an engineer by trade and decided to get back at them, as right after he replaced the hub caps, they would be there that night to take them. my father went to the hardware store and bought some wires, razor blades and grabbed a few car batteries he had in the garage. what he did was truly diabolical. he took a little glue and on the inside of the door handles, ge secured razor blades to cut anyone who atempted to open the door. next he stripped some of the wires he got and wrapped them around the hub caps making sure they were pressed tight against them. he took annother wire and used a little tape and glue to have the wire hovering over the wires so that if someone were to grab them, it would complete the circuit and either burn or shock them. eventually he was able to get them all rigged before running the wire ends back to the batteries. he connected them and then went inside. that night my father left the windows open slightly so he could listen for them. sure enough sometime after midnight those little shitheads came back. but after a few yells they seemed to leave rather quickly. the morning reviled a fair amount of blood around the handle which then trailed down the drive way. one of the hubcaps melted slightly from the heat of the wire but the others were not triggered. needless to say they didnt seem to come back after that one. i just wish we had a security system that also had a camera so i could watch those morons get it.so this happened about 10 years ago. i used to work for a technology company in a government incubator. it was a building that helped start up companies by offering very cheap rent. one of the companies was an animation company. the owner was a complete douchebag. whenever you would run into him he was always a complete dick. anyone that knew him hated him. it was a small company only 4-5 staff members for the first couple of months. honestly i don't even know how he survived that long. the animators were terrible. and by terrible i mean "what the fuck did i just watch" terrible! but, this guy was an amazing salesman. he managed to sell himself and his company to a hip hop group in california. being from a fairly small city in canada (halifax) this was a big deal. it made the business sections in the newspapers and he even won an award for top 50 ceo's in the region. the new contract landed him millions of dollars with around 1.6 million upfront. but, he didn't have enough staff to take on this new animated mini series. he immediately hired approx 20 additional animators. all naive students right out of college. after a couple of weeks his new staff still wasn't being paid. i knew a couple of people that worked there including one of the original 5 (who was receiving a small paycheck) and asked her what was the deal. she told me that he said he didn't have any money and that the money was "coming soon". he somehow convinced most of the animators to continue working for free. he insisted that if they stuck around they would all become rich and it would make all their personal portfolios look amazing. considering most of these kids had no experience, they didn't quit. once i found out about his claim of having no money i contacted a local magazine. it's a political magazine that likes to report on businesses and politicians that are corrupt. they emailed me back and i told them everything i knew about this animation company and what the owner was doing. well, the magazine did some digging and published an article about the owner. after their investigation they had learned that the ceo had in fact received $1.6 million up front for the project. but instead of investing it into the company he spent it all on himself including a new home, valued over $500,000, new cars, etc. you can only imagine what happened next... pretty much every employee quit the day after the article ran. the group from california sued him shortly afterwards because they invested that money and got nothing back. the ceo was taken to court. he was sued by 7 of his previous employees ($31,000+ awarded to each employee). he lost his home, car and was now seen as a joke in the industry. after all this he moved to a different province but things got worse. he had to file for bankruptcy claiming $248,000 in liabilities. one of my ex-employees recently got a job at the same magazine. i asked him if he could look through their archives to see if the information i had leaked to them is what caused their investigations. sure enough, it all started because of my email correspondence with their editor!i work at a grocery store. i do my job and i do it well. i'm known as the person everyone can count on and i'm well liked and respected. my coworker has worked there longer than me. she went to college and considers herself better and smarter than everyone else. she constantly acts like she is the boss of the place and is always telling me what to do and making up rules that aren't needed. if anyone makes any kind of mistake, she makes a huge deal about it. she has to go around tell every single person. if someone messes up something in production, she brings it around and shows it to everyone. she also constantly complains about the way people do things, even things that aren't relevant to her job at all. for example, at night the closers have to go and get packaging that we use to package what we make. i tend to wait until something is actually getting low and grab a whole box of the item from the supplies area in the back of the store, rather than grabbing a tiny bit of everything every night because i think it wastes time. to most people, it doesn't matter what way you do it because either way it gets done. not this girl. she constantly complains about me doing it this way and says that "i never fill the packaging" and "i don't do anything but sit around when i close." she constantly goes to the managers about this issue and they ignore her because it doesn't matter. so she complains loudly and often about how our managers are idiots who don't know how to run anything. she does shit like this constantly. i used to just ignore her, but i finally snapped. i came in the other day and she had gone around telling everyone and all of the managers that i hadn't pulled the icing out of the fridge the night before so it would be soft for decorating cakes in the morning. she gave me a lecture when i walked in and i informed her that yes, i did, i pulled several buckets. she then responded, "oops, i thought you didn't. i didn't know the date yesterday." so, we had plenty of icing for the day, but she was going to yell at me anyways because in her eyes i should've pulled more anyways. she had also already gone around telling all the managers and my coworkers that i didn't do it and didn't bother to apologize or correct herself to anyone, making me look bad. i was done. this happens so damn often. so done, i proceeded to go on facebook and print out every instance of her insulting a customer on facebook for the last few months. this was easy because she never shuts up and posts long, angry tirades often. when i was done i had 10 different posts that were at least a paragraph long. her page is completely public so anyone can see these. in the posts she called customers various things. disgusting pigs because when she was eating lunch she could hear someone chewing next to her, that she wished she could "slap the fuck out of them", idiots, had terrible taste, mocked a black customer's name along with a picture of her cake, called a customer a crazy bitch, and called our shoppers lazy fatasses because there was a loose shopping cart in the parking lot. so i gave it to my manager who is taking it straight to hr today. our company takes this kind of thing extremely seriously since we are all about customer service. i can't fucking wait. she will have no idea who did it either because she has pissed off everyone. it could be anyone. my granddad told me this story a few months back. he used to own a trailer loaning business in the mid to late '90s. some guy returned a trailer from my granddad and after he left, granddad realised he had swapped out the trailer's brand new tyres for 4 older ones, obviously in much worse condition. so, being the kind of guy my granddad is, he drives to the guy's house and demands his tyres back. the guy refuses, so my granddad gives him the choice of either giving the tyres back or calling the police down. the guy says he can't give the tyres back because he doesn't have a jack on him, but my granddad knew he'd make an excuse like that and had taken one with him. granddad starts taking his tyres off this guys car, who then asks "so, do i get my old tyres back then?" granddad just says "nah", leaves the guys car in his own driveway with no tyres and takes his own tyres back and keeps the guys old ones, too.hi there. first time poster, english is not my first language so please be generous with typos and stuffs. here's my story: about a year ago i was getting home after long session of “physical activity” with gf. i was pretty tired so the plan was: get ass home, shower, lay on bed forever. before i get to the point i need to tell you a bit about the place i live in. i live in an apartment in a building kinda out of town. building has two gates: a small one for people/bikes and a large one for cars. there are parking lots inside for residents, however we often lament that there is not much room for parking cars inside; just in front of the large gate there is a large area that can be accessed right from the street and is actually part of the property so i have taken the habit of parking my car(a small one) just there on the side of the large gate. this way there is more room for the other residents inside and i don’t need to carry the remote/key for the large gate (which i always lose anyway). for those that are just passing by it is not really clear that the large area is actually part of the property, so people sometimes park there thinking it is a free space, after we explain the situation people always move without problems but we got tired of this, so we recently put some “no parking” signs inside the area and this stopped happening. ok, so i was tired and in need of rest, i get home and i see a big van (some electric implant company) parked right in my spot. i usually don’t get mad at these things but i was tired and the guy parked right in front of the “no parking” sign. i cannot park anywhere else since i would block the way in/out of the other residents. so i park in front of the large gate, get out of my car and approach the van. on the passenger seat there is a large lady (2l) and i signed her to open the window. i kindly explained her that this is a private property and she needs to move the van. 2l: but there’s nowhere else to park!!!! me: i am sorry but, as i told you, this is a private property and i need to park here. 2l: why can’t you park next to us??? me: it would block the way of the other residents. (isn’t that obvious????) 2l: oh, so you live here, then why don’t you park inside??? at this point i would like everyone to notice that there is absolutely no need for me to explain why i can’t park inside. all she needs to know is that she is on private property and needs to go. anyway i explain the situation and she told me that the electrician (her husband) was making repairs in the building next to mine, and in 5 minutes they were leaving. now i am a bit pissed because i already know is not going to be 5 min and i would have to go and up and down at least once to move the car, and if someone wanted to get in/out in the meanwhile they would (rightfully) be mad at me. so i just leave the car there and go to my apartment, thankfully i have a window which let me see just the entrance and can check if they are still there. after 15/20 min they are still there, i need to rest and i am pissed, so i go to confront them. 2l tells me that the guy came back but only to get some new stuffs from the van and needed to do extra repair. me: why didn’t you tell him to move the van? 2l: he said it was only going to take 10 min. (how is this an answer???) me: i am not interested in that, you need to move the van! 2l: just relax!! (i am more pissed now) me: listen, i kindly asked you to move the van, if you don’t i will call the police and have it removed. 2l: alright alright, i will try to call him, but he probably won’t answer. 2l calls the guy but he won’t aswer the phone. (2l: see?? see??) laughing she starts to show me the ringing phone as if this is something that i am supposed to be interested in. 2l: see? he won’t answer! me: i don’t care! you need to move the car. why don’t you tell me where he is? i will tell him! 2l: he is in that building but i don’t know which apartment. (ufff. i can’t ring every apartment just to find the idiot!!). i give a look inside the van and i see that he left the keys there. me: hey you have the key there! why don’t you move the van?? 2l: ahahahahah. are you crazy???? he is gonna be mad!! ahah me: i don’t care! you must move the van!!! 2l: just relax!!! i can’t do anything. just waith here and tell him when he comes back! now i am really pissed. i don’t say anything and i just start to walk in circles like a shark. after 10 min fat electrician (fe) finally shows up, he is 6’5 tall and at least 420 pounds. i approach him but he starts to shout at me first. fe: what is the problem???? me: this is private property. you can’t park here! move the van! fe: why can’t you park inside??? (arghhhhhhhhh!) me: i just can’t ok? move the van or i call the police. fe: you know what? fine. call the police. he ignores me, get some stuffs from the van and went back to his work. now i could have called the police but i am not sure they would have had the van removed and i might have caused a big fuss for nothing, but police or not those people were going to pay! revenge mode: on!!! i took pictures of their license plate and the name of their company with my phone, then got in my car, move it and parked right behind them (i was like 1-2 inches from the back of their van)! stupid fe parked like 2 inches from the “no parking” sign, my car was behind it and a small wall was on their left; the right was free but there’s no way they could have maneuvered out of it. more important: the passage was now free and the residents could go in/out. i tell doublel i got their license and datas just in case they were to try damage my car and that i would be back in a couple hours to move the car if i remembered to. i went back to my apartment and turned tv on. after 10 min i hear people screaming at the entrance. i took the interphone and asked what was the problem. fe is crazy angry and wants me to move the car. “alright, i got it i am coming”, went back to watch tv. another 10 min pass and more screaming. this time i go. fe: you have to move the car right now!! me: why?? this is my property! fe: you can’t block my way! i got work to do!! me: fine. call the police! (i am not sure the police would have removed his stupid van, but sure as hell they weren’t going to remove my car from my property) at this point fe is really mad and start screaming obscenities. one thing i didn’t notice: he had a lot of large electrical stuffs on the ground (cables and others). but he couldn’t put it back in because his stupid van didn’t have a lateral entrance but only in the back (where my car blocks the way!) why am i telling this? because it is starting to rain! all his stupid things could get damaged! i notice he also understand the situation so i say: me: ok, ok. how about i do you a favor? i will move my car but you will have to pay me! say 50 €? fe: are you fucking with me??’ me: as you wish. you can pay me or call the police and see if they give a shit about you. if you don’t pay i will move the car in a couple more hours. fe starts screaming more obscenities, get into the van and comes back with my money. i take my money and move the car. fe and 2l load their stuffs and leave at full speed. no one should ever be in my spot! this is going to be long, i apologize, i tried to be brief, but you have to know how awful this girl is. so my boyfriend's brother, "joe", was dating this girl, "amber", and nobody liked amber. when i first started dating my boyfriend, "zeke", he asked if i'd like to hang out with joe and amber one night, go on a double date. i said sure. well on the way there, zeke warned me that no one liked amber, he said she was stuck up and rude. i'm not the type to base my opinions on what others say, so while i heard what he said, i told him i appreciated the heads up, but i'd make my own decisions about her. well she was awful, indeed. she'd give everyone dirty looks throughout dinner, she wouldn't talk to anyone but joe, unless addressed directly, and then you'd get an eye roll and a one or two word answer. also, she's a big girl, i have nothing against big girls, but she dressed like a cheap hooker in clothes far too revealing and too tight for her, with thick black eyeliner, cakey makeup, and ratty hair. joe's a sweetheart. decent looking, funny, generous, kind, gentle, friendly. just all around a great guy. in every way possible, he has been like a brother to me, and i love him like family. anytime joe and zeke would try to hang out, amber would complain. on the rare occasion that joe and zeke got to hang out, it would usually be with their other brother, todd. todd's a nice guy, nice wife, cute son. we all get along great, except when amber is there. so when the boys got to hang out, i'd usually stay home because they got so little time together, but sure enough, amber would be calling and texting and bitching the whole time about how joe was always so busy! and it's not fair! and when is he coming home?! it was ridiculous. at one point, about a year into dating zeke, joe called us and asked if we would give amber one more shot. he invited us to dinner, asked us to really just try, because he loved her and he was at the end of his rope. if she couldn't get along with us, he was done. we all agreed to go. amber made an effort, so did i, we became friendly, we had lunch and wen shopping a few times. joe seemed relieved. amber had bought a kitten. kitten grew into a cat. then she decided she wanted a lab puppy instead. i asked what she was planning on doing with the cat. she said she was going to drop it off on the side of the road in the country. i begged her not to, i asked her to bring the cat to my apartment (where we are not allowed pets), and i'd find the cat a new home, just don't drop it off on the road, as a coyote would probably find it and kill it. she laughed and said, "i don't care, i hate that cat! i want my puppy!" again, i asked her to please give me the cat. no dice. the cat got dropped off on the side of the road and i never saw it again. so she got a lab puppy. a sweet, pretty little lab girl who loved to cuddle and give puppy breath kisses! about six months in, she decided she wanted a chihuahua. so she "got rid" of the black lab without notice. we still don't know what happened to the black lab. but who cares?! she got her teacup chihuahua! then he proposed. amber said yes. and went back to crazy. zeke was asked to be the best man. i was not asked to be in the wedding party, which was honestly fine with me. to be honest, i didn't trust the dress she would have put me in, and i didn't want to have to pay for all the extras. well she asked me to come to a dress fitting for her. i said sure, and asked when she could pick me up since zeke had our car that day, she had to pass my house on her way too the dress shop anyway, i was sick, and it was pouring out (portland, or. rain is not uncommon here.) amber replied, "no, you can take the bus." i politely said i'd attend a different fitting. she then invited me a few weeks later, i said sure, and planned on going. well she cancelled on me the morning of the fitting saying she wanted to go with another friend at a different time and if i couldn't get off work, i couldn't come. well i wasn't taking time off work, so again, i declined, but said if there was anything else i could help with, just let me know. and i volunteered my time, effort, and money to make their wedding favors by hand. (i bake and was going to do a chocolate dipped cookie for them, and decorate the cookies in their wedding colors, wrap them in pretty bags, and tie ribbon on them for over 100 guests.) about a week after that, zeke and i invited joe and amber over for dinner and game night, which is something we all try to get together for on a bi-weekly basis. they came over, and zeke asked amber how wedding planning was going. amber had the nerve to look right at me and say, "well if someone would help me, it would be a lot easier!" what? i later sent her a facebook message that stated since i was not related to her, in the wedding party, or being paid by her that she had no right to ask me for anything for her wedding. and that anything i volunteered to do was because i wanted to and was not obligated to do anything more.that was all i said. no angry words, no meanness, no name calling, just straight forward. well she had a field day and told joe that i called her a bitch and c*nt. i saved screen shots of the messages, and the messages themselves on facebook, i tried to tell joe i didn't say anything mean to her or call her any names, but she had found a way to tamper with the messages and had written in terrible things that looked like they were from me. zeke knew i never said anything mean to her, he saw the messages before i sent them, he watched me type them, because i wanted to know if he minded me sending them, and wanted to make sure i didn't come across as mean or unnecessarily harsh. joe wasn't having it. he was, understandably, upset with me, thinking i had said these things. i then found out she had told other people the same lies about me, that i was verbally attacking her, calling her names, etc. none of that was happening, by the way. and anyone who knows me will tell you i am very friendly and smiley, and i'm nice to everyone. now around this time, we found out that i am pregnant. their wedding was scheduled for six days before my due date, for about 3 weeks, i stewed, not knowing what pregnancy hormones would do to me, not wanting to go to the wedding and say or do something awful if provoked. i asked zeke if he minded terribly if i didn't go, knowing full well, i'd be a hormonal, pregnant mess. he said it was fine. i then asked if i could write her a letter telling her what i really thought of her, bones and all. zeke said, "go for it, as long as it's all true, but leave todd out of it. he hates her, but wants to talk to joe in his own way in his own time." i said that was fine, then reiterated that if i wrote the letter it would be brutally honest, no holds barred, i'm done, kind of thing. and that it could have some backlash from joe to zeke, since i'd be telling her exactly how i felt. zeke said as long as it was true, go for it. so i did. i wrote her a letter telling her how selfish i thought she was, how trashy, tacky, rude, and shallow. what a golddigger she was, that she was a liar. that the way she treated her animals was deplorable. and to never contact me again and to remove my name from her guest list, as i would not be attending. i read it to zeke, he said it was all true so send it. and i did. 20 minutes later, zeke's phone is buzzing like crazy with texts from joe, telling him to "keep greyson in line! she's saying things that aren't okay!" zeke replied that everything i said was true, he agreed to the message i sent. zeke and joe yelled for about a half hour. it wasn't fun. well word got out to todd and his wife, "laura", that i'd sent the facebook message. i showed them the messages. they'd all heard from amber that i was saying horrible things, all of which i had proof that i'd never said. then todd, joe, and zeke's mom and dad heard about it. all of a sudden, everyone is admitting that they can't stand amber. dad said he wouldn't stop the wedding, but he wasn't paying another dime, and if it went on he wouldn't attend. todd was neutral, but told joe he did not like amber at all, but that he loves joe and he'll support him no matter what. a week later joe left amber. she cried, whined, accused, tried to get money from him, etc. and the whole time everyone knew i was the snowflake that caused the avalanche. at first i felt bad. but joe is so much happier, it's like he's an entire different person. and so many people have thanked me for it, saying they didn't have the guts to say what i said. even joe thanked me like a week ago. amber is still furious, but i don't care. she's single and being trashy, lost her apartment and had to move back in with her parents and loser brother, her job has gone to crap, but at least she's doing it far away from all of us. tl;dr boyfriend's brother was dating a lying, tacky, trashy, selfish golddigger. was.been lurking for a while and felt it was time to give back... (this happened several years ago.) i was working full time at a mediocre-paying job while putting myself through college at night paying for it out of pocket. this left me stretched on finances so i ended up in a less than ideal apartment complex and by less than ideal i mean that the cops maintained a presence there most of the time. most folks kept to themselves, but occasionally you'd get someone that was just obnoxious living near you. it was inevitable. i knew it was my turn with an obnoxious neighbor when i first met him. he was talking loudly in the breezeway of my building. why he wasn't on the balcony of his apartment i don't know. not wanting to be petty i just turned the tv up and ignored him. it wasn't long before the talking got louder and my door started moving like someone was trying to open it. i jerked it open and the guy about fell in. it turns out he was leaning on it while having his conversation. after politely letting him know that it was very annoying i give him an "it's all good" and close my door. immediately he refers to me using a racial slur in spanish to the person on the other end of the phone. i may not be fluent in spanish but i know some important slang. he'd have parties all night, sometimes with a dozen people in the breezeway getting drunk and rowdy. there was always trash on the stairs (e.g., half eaten cheeseburgers, old milkshakes, etc) and cigarette butts everywhere. his large pit bull would bark all day just about non-stop. i could bitch about it and be the whiny neighbor, or just bide my time until i graduate and then move. graduation was only a semester away so i decided to bide my time. coming home from school one night i'm walking through the parking lot reading my phone when i see a dog running at me growling. it's dude's pit bull rearing to attack me. dude's girlfriend yells at him and he calls his dog off and breaks out laughing. enough's enough, someone's going to get hurt so i complain to the apartment manager but am told without proof their hands were tied. great. i live the next few months at the complex relatively incident free (just the above annoyances) until i'm woken up one week night at 2am. there's screaming and crying in the breezeway, lots of loud talking, and the sounds of incoming sirens. looking out my window into the parking lot and i see dude run by with his dog. looking through the peep hole i see a girl in the hallway bleeding profusely. turns out his girlfriend and her friend were drunk and raised their voices at one another. the dog then attacked the friend mauling her pretty badly. police didn't know where either dude or the dog was, and the friend didn't want to pursue charges, so they left. shortly after they left, dude comes back with the dog. i did call the police and let them know that he and the dog were back, but they never returned (thanks police.) on my way to work the next morning i stop by the apartment manager and let her know about the incident. again she says she can't do anything without proof. i implore her to call the police and confirm, but she refuses saying they get updates from the sheriff every month. ultimately her problem was that due to legal reasons she can't seek to evict someone herself, otherwise it might look like she's targeting a given race or something. fuming about the situation while at work i managed to find the police incident report for the mauling online. i printed it out and delivered it to her on my way home. she had an appreciative look on her face and told me the eviction process would start before i could leave the building. true to her word, the bad neighbor was out at the end of the month. according to the apartment manager they were pissed and cussing as they drove away. turns out he had numerous warrants so had his girlfriend rent the apartment. neither of them had family in the area (the girlfriend's family lived in another country) so they had no one to turn to for a place to stay. the icing on the cake was when the apartment manager let slip that when the next apartment called her for a reference, she'd kindly inform them of all incidents that occurred. i don't know what happened to them but i do know they had a hard time finding a place to live. tl;dr: be an asshole to your polite and quiet neighbor? enjoy being homeless.**i posted this as a reply in another thread, but a couple people told me to post this here as well:** sorry in advance, on mobile, on a plane. i worked in the finance department of a dealership. in order to secure financing, vehicles had to have proof of insurance submitted to the finance company before the customer can take possession. that was my job, so when the customers first sat down with me, i'd tell them to get their insurance arranged and send me proof. one day i hear my name being paged for a phone call. i pick it up "hello, qwer-asdf-zxcv speaking, how can i help you?" the voice on the phone says "are you the asshole who needs proof of insurance?" **me:** "excuse me?" **him:** "did you sell a vehicle to mr and mrs. x and now want me to get the insurance?" **me:** "well we sold them a vehicle yes..." him: "how the fuck can i arrange insurance without a vin" **me:** "uhhhh they have a copy of the bill of sale" the conversation continued like this for a whille, him swearing, me answering his stupid questions. basically he blamed me for the customers not giving him the information he needed. and apparently the customers were quite antsy to pick it up, so when i told them i hadn't received proof of insurance, they must have called him and gotten angry. so anyways, i have no problem talking to insurance agents if the customers didn't do what they should have, but nobody calls me an asshole and gets away with it. **revenge step 1** use phonemyphone.com to ring him every 10 minutes at 3am. that's what you get for having your home number in the phone book. **revenge step 2** he is an insurance broker, so he does a fair amount of advertising. one of the places he advertises was on kijiji (canadian craigslist). i had seen his ads a ton (he was actually pretty successful) one nice feature about kijiji is you can see "posters other ads". this asshole also happened to have rental apartments all over town. so with a couple fake email accounts i arranged viewings for his dozen or so apartments every day of the week for the next month. (never fuck with a retail salesperson, they have way too much free time). i got about a dozen angry emails back asking why i didn't show before i noticed he stopped advertising on kijiji. **revenge step 3** my piece de resistance was shortly after i quit the dealership. i still hated this guy, or well, i actually didn't care, but he seemed like a dick. my friend works it for a large insurance company, and i had helped him out with something that required me to get an email address with the insurance company's domain. so i logged in, and created my signature as "vp of acquisitions", and gave him a call. i told him we were interested in buying his brokerage, since we saw his success from afar. he was sucking my dick from the beginning, telling me how successful he was, and how inch business he generated. i told him to email me his relevant financials and that i would call him back. so he does, and i actually put the effort into coming up with a reasonable purchase price. and then i added a couple hundred thousand to make it enticing for him. i called him back, gave him the offer, and then asked if he would be interested in he team as a vp after the buyout. he said he would so i asked him to come down to our offices for an interview. the key part here is the offices of this insurance company are in a big city, a four hour drive from where he lives. i told him i'd like to meet at 9am. so this asshole has to leave his house at 5am to make it ( i also told him to bring me a coffee). at this point i tell me friend to delete the email address ( he knew what i was doing, although perhaps not as in depth) and i also called him from a blocked number because, well i didn't want to get caught. so unfortunately i can't say for 100% sure that it worked. but two weeks later, i did call his brokerage from my regular number. he answered the phone. i said "are you the asshole who drove four hours to x city for a fake interview?" . there was a long pause, i can hear him steaming up through the phone, and then he said "who the fuck is this?". i hung up. don't be rude.throwaway account. for the past week or so, my mom and i have been playing host to my asshole cousin. the kid came down to check out universities, but took fuck all interest in them and just started to be rude to myself and my mom. not cool. but for everyday that he's been living with us, something's gone wrong in my bathroom - either the bathmats are askew, waters fucking everywhere, it smells like piss, and more. a bit of pre-enraging/disgusting shit he did was use my personal razor to shave his pubes. he thought he could hide it by cleaning the front of the razor of the evidence, and not the floor of the shower cubicle. however, today i found my bathroom floor completely wet and sticky, smelling of mildew and piss, and both bathmats flung all over the fucking place - oh, and complete with pubes. in a fit of fucking rage, over the way he's acting, treating me, mom, and threatening to steal my stuff, i took his toothbrush. and gave the drain a little clean. more of a scrub. and his loofa? we'll just say that they're fucking fantastic for cleaning shit streaks and piss from your toilet. was i done there? pfft no, this is 20 years of resentment towards this prick. his milk was next. nothing too malicious, and nothing enough to make him sick (we were out of laxatives). but what tastes bad when added to milk and doesn't show? white vinegar. just enough was added so it didn't change the amount that was in the container, or have a strong smell. and for the heck of it, i decided to get him back for breaking a ds of mine - by fucking up his. i undid the back and acquainted it with the business end a nail file and wet fish food (thank you melted daphnia), i then carefully put it back together. edit:/ not previously mentioned in the above post, but he did break the ds in plain site, as well as microwave some games, chew on a cartridge, hit on my girl friends and make them incredibly uncomfortable, told me to "learn the art of keeping my mouth shut" when i asked what he'd study, and when i left my pc unattended, he tried to access personal documents and my paypal account.one time a wise man said to me: *"a broken heart heals quickly, if you don't let the pain get between the cracks"* -- or something like that ;-) *** after over 5 years i thought meg is the one. high school sweetheart, her parents loved me, i became a family member. her brother, just 2 years older than her, had a very rare disease and since the age 10 he was on a wheelchair. i was always there, helping out, driving him for his rehabilitation, sometimes even hundreds of miles. i have never accepted money for my "services," that's what family does. they were rather on a poor side, always beaten by life, always struggling. father in another country sending money, getting every financial aid possible, in a huge debt. i wasn't doing too good, but i decided to sacrifice my own pleasures for something that mattered to me. *** i and meg had lived together in the past, and we decided to live together again. we didn't split, mostly the decisions of living together or not, were financially based. i spent my whole summer to make our new place look better. i put a lot of money in it. besides working and fixing the condo, i hadn't had time for anything else. i was excited for meg to come back. we hadn't talked much, since she had a summer job in another country. i understood that and i knew she will spend her earned money wisely, after she'll come back. *** she came back and she was a different person. short skirt, heels, a lot of makeup. she was never like this. always very modest, generous, appreciative and always helping to other people. she had a very good heart, and i didn't know what is going on. i felt she's not meg any more. not the one i knew. she was very distant and i knew there is more. i was patient and gave her time. after enough time had past, i asked her to take a drive with me, which took little convincing. i took her to one of our spots, where we had shared a lot. she told me nothing, besides asking for a month break. i didn't say a word, but it felt in my hear like it's over. month break from what? a relationship? it doesn't work that way, not for me. i agreed and told her to take her time. this "break" month was very hard for me. didn't seem hard for her. i still couldn't understand why she had changed so much. yet, i was helping out with her brother, which even included helping him to get dressed, and other basic tasks, if you know what i mean. *** one day, when our good friend came to visit us with a bottle of wine, meg started crying for no reason. she closed herself in the restroom. since our friend was there, i asked her to keep an eye on her, and i decided to take a drive, since it helps me to think. during the drive, something occurred to me. i just started to see everything as a whole picture. suddenly all the dots were connecting themselves. cheating has crossed my mind before, but i am not a paranoid person and i don't let my emotions determine my actions. but this time, everything, every small thing, started to be a part of the puzzle. i called my friend, asking if meg's ok, and decided to give her some more time, and get her little worried about me. i knew her well, and my plan was to make her emotionally involved in me. with her not knowing where i'm at, i knew she would feel out of control about the situation, and i knew her emotions will explode at some point. at least i hoped for that. i went to see her mother. it was a 200 miles drive, so i had some time to think. meg's mom also knew something was wrong, and she was worried, like every mother would. i had a very close relationship with the mother. having no choice, i told her that i think it's over between me and meg, not going into the details. her mother cried and it felt like a goodbye. that was the last time i saw her. when i was on my way back, i got a text from meg, that she's going home for a few days and she's in the bus now. *** it had never crossed my mind, to violate meg's privacy, but, meg's mother called me when meg was on the bus back to our condo. her mother checked meg's phone when she was at her mother's. i just couldn't keep hanging like this any more. the texts of course confirmed my worries about cheating, however i have never seen the text on my own. i asked her mother to not talk to her about that and she agreed. *** when meg got home, i wasn't there. i decided to spend a few days at my friend's place, just to heat up her emotions. what i tried to achieve was to make her feel that my behavior is out of ordinary, unpredictable. which would make her suspicious, and feeling out of control. i knew meg's schedule and i got perfectly when she was in the middle of her morning shower. i thought i will see something which would confirm my suspicions. i hid under the bed, so she wouldn't see me. i heard her checking my stuff in the part of the room which was mine, later checking my desk, definitely looking for something. she left, but i knew her well enough and i decided to lay under the bed for another 10-15 minutes. sure enough, she forgot something, as always. additional 15 minutes under the bed, and time to investigate. my work was starting in 2 hours, so i didn't have much time. nothing obvious after fast search and i couldn't find anything which she has taken from me, but she definitely did, and it didn't sound like an office supply. it felt shameful, but i felt i don't have any choice. something definitely was going on. i unscrewed her laptop, unscrewed her hard drive and copied all the hard drive to mine. after work, i went to visit my friend who's a computer wizard. i knew with his help i will get to the files i need much quicker. finding the archive files isn't hard, but how do you read them. sure enough, with his help and a little bit of time, i was able to read everything from my computer. just by skimming thru it was obvious for me. cheating was just the top of the iceberg of the things i got to know. i got back home, and sure enough, my checks are gone. i couldn't believe it. it was just not like her. *** at that point, i knew it's over for life. a few months ago i got an offer to move to the us, where i live now. nothing was there to stop me, but what's my plan? i can go, i have the visa, money, but... and then this amazing feeling of the adventure. all my life, i was very static, very reasonable, sensible and sane. never done anything crazy. i felt like to shake things up a little. i mean a lot! first things first, i had to take care of the business. *** as early as i could, i closed my bank account, changed all the passwords just in case, and called the owner of the condo. when meg was at work, with the help of my best friend alex, i packed all my belongings. the owner of the condo came, and she was sure impressed about the improvements. i told her i had to move out, and we need to figure out the way to terminate the contract. after all, she gave me the deposit back and i didn't have to pay this month's rent and utilities. she even agreed to re-assign the internet contract to her. she knew, she will be able to get much better deal on the condo, and since i was a perfect tenant, she trusted me. i told her my ex-girlfriend will move out in a few days. she made big eyes, but no questions asked. next, was my job. i went to see my boss, showed my resignation letter and we said goodbye in peace. no hard feelings. i left a short note to my ex. "we have to move out. you have time until [date]." i also blocked my ex on my phone, email, and social media. *** *here is what i know, from couple of our shared friends:* meg freaked out about the whole situation. she told all the friends i was cheating on her. she got in some trouble at work, after she tried to steal some equipment and was fired. she quit her school, and until this day she doesn't have a degree (she had less than 2 semesters left). she moved to the country where her new boyfriend was. after about 7 months since i saw her last time, she got a baby girl (not mine). her boyfriend ended up in a jail for some reason and spent there 6 months. from what i know, they are together, but it isn't a happy relationship. *** *what i know from the mother:* nothing. i decided to leave the family alone. i thought it will be the best for all. *** *what i know from meg:* nothing. she sent me birthday wishes twice, which ended up in trash as soon as i got them. she sent it to my parent's house. they don't live there, they're with me now, but they've kept the house. *** **what i did and i think (hope) happened:** i moved out and meg doesn't know what the heck is going on. she sees the note, calls to the owner, who explains her the situation and that's how she gets to know she's my ex now. she goes to empty my account, but she can't get money with the checks. since she's not a detective type and she's driven by emotions, she's just furious. i took every single *thing/gift* i gave her. i mean everything i could find, and i donated it with her name. she received a "thank you" letter from a local foster care house. so she knows that *her stuff wasn't stolen by me, it was donated by her*, and she can't do a thing about it. her car was technically mine. it was a very crappy car, at a shop for a repair during the events. i bought it from our friend who was in need and since then she always wanted to get it back. i sold the car back to her, for the price of the car plus the repair cost, asking her to give back the things left in the car to meg. just to play some more evil, i found on gumtree (european craigslist), a cheap ass bicycle, which fit into meg's car perfectly. i hope she was smart enough to get the message. lastly, meg's brother borrowed from me the equivalent of $3,000. it was for he's new wheelchair, computer, and some minor stuff. i decided i will just leave it. i sent a package to meg's brother and mother (he lived with her) and i stuffed it with his favorite things, plus i bought him an xbox with some games. it was a goodbye letter to him and the mother, letting them know i'm moving to the us. that's how meg got to know where i will be. the letter didn't mention a word about her. meg hates me, her family loves me. *** after time has passed, i think i could do some things better, like not digging in her laptop, which makes me feel shameful. at that time i felt it was the only option. some things i have done, i feel i couldn't do better. moving to the us was the best decision of my life. it was hard in the beginning, but for sure i want to live here. i haven't visited my country since i moved. 4 years pass in 2 months. *** **tl;dr^(ex-girlfriend gets taken away everything, even her family.)** *** *** *edit 1: someone here had a problem with understanding how the hell i was able to copy 200gb in less than 2 hours, thinking, that [i had to unscrew a laptop to the pieces]( i wrote here about imessages, so that's number uno that tells it's an apple machine. to explain... it was a macbook, [which requires just a few screws at the bottom side, and than just 4 or maybe even less to get the hard drive out.]( the files were copied using [an enclosure]( [you simply hook up the hard drive to the enclosure]( and drag the files. [how long did it take? about an hour from what i remember.]( i know i was able to make the whole operation in less than 2 hours, with getting to work on time (walking distance). nowadays i copy 200gb in matter of a few minutes to my laptop using [this]( and [this]( i assume the person who has a problem, has to have a very old computer. i don't remember if the hard drive had 150gb on it, 200gb on it, or just 100gb. i remember it's capacity was 250gb, i assume it was sata ii 5400rpm or 7200rpm. the enclosure was firewire 800. files copied straight from meg's hard drive to my computer.* *** *edit 2: a few people shown a concern here about the checks. after a recent pm i feel it's worth to explain. checks in europe do not work like in the us. same idea, but they are not common. not every bank will accept them. in my country and bank, the checks were more like actual money, which had to be covered by money on the account or payed with cash. they are used for the international transactions. i (sort of) had to "buy" these checks. i wanted to purchase a motorcycle from the us (yamaha r1), since it's much cheaper. i was almost about to purchase it. i had one check on $12,000, one on $1,000 and one on $1,800 (or something close). since meg was my girlfriend, she knew that i want to buy a motorcycle. she knew how it works, etc. i decided to go with the check, because with that kind of amount the fees with a bank transfer would increase the price in my situation. the checks had only printed amounts. it was up to me who i will write them to. meg knew all of this, as well as that i have even more on my bank account. that were my life savings, since i got my first job. a sport motorcycle was my dream. well, i still don't have it. all my saving i had to invest in my future in the us. it will happen anyway.* *** ***about 12 years ago i found out my ex had been cheating while i was out working a job that required me to travel. in an attempt to fix the marriage i took a different job where i was home. the job was in southern ga so we moved from nc. we had a 18 month old son who was obviously still in diapers. (this will be important later). after trying for a few months she left me to go back to her boyfriends. enter the large uhaul that she loaded almost everything we owned into while i was working. i came home and all she had left was to hook the car up to the tow dolly. she couldn't figure it out. i refused to help her and went into the house. in the empty bedroom i was greeted by a horrible stench. she had left a diaper that was packed full of fresh baby shit and still warm. she left in the uhaul to find someone to help her hook up the car and i took the diaper out and put it under the drivers seat of the car. georgia in august is unforgiving. she came back about 15 minutes later with a guy who opened the door to the car and nearly puked while i sat in the house an laughed. her brother later told me that they had to sell the car because the stench was in everything. they almost had to give it away.so i was walking home from macdonalds and just refilled my drink before i left for my walk home. as im cutting across the parking lot near a very busy street (important later) a car pulls up next to me and a girl with a nice white dress on asks me if i knew how to get to some chapel so as i walked closer to the car to tell them which way they should take. the guy in the back and the girl threw eggs at me luckily only one hit my leg and the rest missed but i still had my large drink from macdonalds that was basically full so i threw the drink and managed to get it right in the window and got the girl right in the chest. the pop exploded and drenched her and they sped off onto the busy street. so i continued heading home and after a block or two i see them pulled over by a cop car. im guessing they got pulled over for speeding on one of the busiest streets. as i walk by the car i see the girl with a big brown splotch on her dress. i just smiled at her and walked home.this is a long story, but i've marked off the "revenge" and "pro revenge" bits with appropriate headings to facilitate skimming. **background** around 8 years ago, i applied for a job working for a relatively small organization as a manager. instead of the position i applied for, they offered me a different job reporting to the person they hired for the management position - still a step up in my career but not quite as good. i accepted the job and soon after was invited out to dinner to meet my new manager. let's call her sara. i immediately became skeptical of sara. she presented as a devout christian woman while throwing shade at her previous co-workers and jobs, all of which raised alarms i my mind. i resigned myself to being polite but distant from her rather than running away as fast as i could because i figured i might have the wrong idea about her. yeah, not so much... as soon as we started working together, she started pawning off much of her work to me. she hated making phone calls which she was required to make, so i got stuck with those. she wouldn't return messages from clients so i ended up doing that too. the organization was small and had a serious resource shortage, something which was made worse by some recent system changes that were made right around the time we arrived. her shirking was positioned as "delegation" since she dealing with fixing those systems issues. the higher-ups saw it as a temporary issue and implored me to be cooperative. soon, i was working 60 hours a week trying to keep up with the workload. i got paid overtime, but no amount of money can make up for constantly being thrown under the bus by your incompetent boss because i couldn't handle the workload i was being asked to manage. nobody could! when she would actually get called on the carpet for mistakes and issues, she would yell and scream at me while simultaneously blaming me for the problems she caused. meanwhile, she was having long conversations with anyone who wandered past her doorway, leaving at 4 everyday with no overtime, and smiling that self-righteous smile of the oblivious sociopath. i think she truly thought she was a great and successful manager. i will point out that the people in upper management clearly noticed that something was up with the work in our department. a year had passed and things weren't getting better...they were actually worse on my end since now i was so demoralized that i had cried a couple of times at work. thus, they didn't pay much attention when i pointed out that our work loads were inequitable and that i was basically working both of our jobs, mine and sara's, without the appropriate tools since sara hadn't actually fixed the system issues she had been hired to manage. other people in the organization didn't really understand the system issues because they never had to use the system. **revenge** i finally decided that i was finished dealing with sara and needed to demonstrate the dysfunction to the higher ups. i waited for sara to take a week of vacation and then promptly called in sick for two days once she was gone, leaving the higher-ups to try and handle client issues for those two days. i didn't answer any calls from the office during working hours, despite having some frantic "how the hell do i do what the client is asking me to do?" messages. instead, i waited until after hours, claimed to have been sleeping due to medication, and then left long messages detailing the convoluted processes of how the system worked (or didn't). i took the time to work on my resume and write up my resignation letter, including an offer to stay for up to two months to facilitate a transition (i didn't bear the lower-tiered worked i'll will and the money would be helpful if i could have a set date in mind, so i felt ok with a longer notice period). i arrived back at work after my illness and had three of the higher ups walk straight into my office, shut the door, and sit down. "what the fuck is going on here?" was the first thing that came tumbling out of the general manager's mouth. so i spent a good ten minutes detailing the system issues, reminding them that i had consistently mentioned being overworked and not having the tools to do my job. apparently, sara, unbeknownst to me, had been bad-mouthing me to all of them, calling me incompetent and slow. once they told me that, i said i found that surprising since she had spent all of that time bad-mouthing the system to me and calling the management incompetent. one of the other managers told me that they were attributing the problems to me and my emotional state, and now realized after just two days of trying to do my job just how awful things really were. they apologized to me for doubting my claims and vowed to make changes. i thanked them and handed them my resignation notice, telling them that i had decided to go back to school to pursue a new career and couldn't do that while working for or with sara. over the next two months before i finally left, sara basically became a woman defeated. i fed them every nasty word she said for two months, including showing them some text messages i received in which she bad mouthed the organization. the gm told me they couldn't fire her because anyone new would be even worse with the system, but that they were taking steps to cross-train others on the system in order to be able to get rid of her. they monitored her office and interrupted long conversations. they removed me from her control, allowing me to return her delegated work and insist she do it herself. we had long meetings about systems issues during which she was left looking like a bumbling incompetent. after i finally left (they had a little party for me), they called her into the gms office and read her the riot act for basically chasing me out the door and costing the organization a strong employee...their words, not mine. sara contacted me after being told off and expressed how sad she was that i would say such things. i denied using the words they claimed i used, saying only that i talked about the circumstances and not the people. i lied purposefully in the faint hope that it would be useful to me in the future. i had no great love for the management of the organization despite their recent attempts to make amends and it cost me little to play both sides. her reputation was so bad at that point that nobody would believe her if she said i stuck up for her. it wound up being a good instinct! they fired her 3 months later and told her not to use them as a reference. she has basically been stuck in a series of temporary and low-paying jobs ever since she left. we are still social media friends and i have seen her messages about looking for help from god and tough financial times. as much as i want to feel bad for her, i can't muster up even a little bit of concern for her. instead, i enjoyed a little private laugh at every bad thing that seemed to happen to her. call me a jerk, but i view her as someone who tried to destroy my career to save herself some work. **cold-blooded pro revenge** so it has been nearly 8 years, as i said, and i have finally had a chance to truly extract my pound of flesh from her. last week, she sent me a long e-mail talking about our working together and how she's happy to see is things have gone well for me and how she looks back fondly on our work together. she said she knows that we didn't work together ideally, but that she had few options and wanted to ask me for a professional reference. i jumped at the chance and reassured her that i held her no ill will. "here is my contact info. just have them get in touch. anything you want me to emphasize when we talk?" i got all the details and told her i would let her know when i got the call. i finally got the call this past thursday. i proceeded to damn her with as faint praise as i could possibly muster. i really put on the hollywood touches: weird vocal inflections, thoughtful pauses before tepid endorsements, seemingly careful and precise word selection. they must have heard from others about her penchant for talkativeness because they asked me point blank about that too. i went super cagey in my response; "i mean, she certainly is friendly enough but i can't recall any personal experience with her being distracted from her work by talking too much. of course, i spent so much time in my office that perhaps i just didn't see it." got the word this morning thanking me for the reference and saying they hired someone else for the job. i expressed my condolences and told her to feel free to let me know if she needs another reference. she told me she would definitely be in touch. **tl;dr - there once was a manager lady whose actions were all sorts of shady i got her ass fired she tried to get hired used my reference to keep her in hades** in college, my roommates and i three a lot of parties. they were well attended because we always kept a friendly vibe going on and would make you leave if you were being an ass. these guys from the next apt building over show to to one and are being pretty obnoxious, but tolerable. where they waaaaaaay crossed the line was, this one girl got too drunk and she wasn't with anybody who could take her home, so we put her in my bed, gave her some water and a bowl for puking if that needed to happen. i'll crash on the sofa tonight, no bigs. one of the douchey crew is seen hovering around my bedroom door,we keep an eye on it. he's suspicious to me but there's room for doubt,so we give him the benefit of it. but when he thinks nobody's looking, he goes in there. one of my roomies was watching though, and goes in after him. i will skip the predictable discussion that was had, he tried to say he wasn't doing anything but he took a good while coming up with a lie, we told him and his roommates to beat it. they actually argue with us as if they have a right to negotiate with us about whether or not they can be at our apartment, after one of them almost certainly tried to rape someone. they got physically intimidating but i can tell actual prelude to violence from face-saving chest pounding, send them on their way firmly but without escalating. we seriously couldn't believe what almost happened and the more we thought about it the more pissed we got. justice must be served. we got a ten gallon bucket and put it on the deck. we instructed every guy at the party that he had to pee in the bucket. a few girls even hiked up their skirts and contributed to the fund. we stayed up super late drinking beer until the bitch was damn near topped off. put the lid on it, carried it over to their door, tilted it against the door and tied a string from it to the doorknob. next morning we woke that girl up, fed her eggs, told her what went on, and we all drank coffee on our deck while we waited for those shitstains to open the door. blooshfirst some background, i'm david and tony is my younger brother. i his older brother. i was the street smarts, fast talker, great bullshitter type kid...the sheriff knew my mother’s number by heart! tony...well tony is the well behaved respectable kid that went on to get great grades and go to college. well tony ended up creating his own company. they do networking and servers and stuff like that. me? well i became the gsm of 7 different dealerships. my job is basically the shot caller, well i don't so much call the shots more as review the decisions my managers make. now of course with tony being my brother and our families are close knit, his wife, my wife, his children, my children are always together. with this tony and i bounce ideas off each other all the time and are pretty in tune with each other business. heck i help fund the early days of tony’s company and a major shareholder. so i do have my influence which i never really use…cause i don’t know anything about his business (how it works etc) now tony was in the final stages of bidding on a massive contract...basically as he explained it, the contract was his and he was searching internally for the team to run this contract and he needed a project manager. he already had the pay plan for this position put together and whoever got it would make a shit ton of money and there was quite a bit of completion internally for this position especially among 2 prime individuals. maurice and allen both equally qualified however my brother was leaning towards maurice since he was with my brother for 2 years more than allen. now i didn’t actually know either one of them so i gave my brother my general advice which was if both can do the job and only one can have one give to the guy who has been with you the longest…therefore maurice was to get the position. my brother said he’d mull it over the weekend and make the big announcement that friday. now with me being in this business as long as i have i’ve grown to develop relationships with many different employers and many of them i have special pricing deals with them. tony company of course receives a special pricing deal. all his employees have to do is show their badge and we apply a discount to their order since they work for tony. now of course we do have some models which we have disqualified from this incentive…for various reasons. one of them is the ford raptor which is a hot seller and a major profit generator for us. so its excluded. well i do my rounds to the different dealers i manage and had stopped by a ford store which was having some employee issues (as is fairly common in this industry) and putting together a plan with the store manager when a sales person popped in and said he needed the store manager to handle a difficult customer. i of course enjoy getting involved in selling cars, it’s a welcome relief so i inquired about the deal…turns out it was maurice who works for my brothers company wanting a ford raptor! i told the store manager to stay put and i’ll handle this. so i walk out to greet maurice. maurice is insulting my dealership, my employees, and our practices. i pride ourselves on being above board on everything so this really pisses me off. never the less maurice is a potential customer and should be treated with respect. i sit down with maurice and qualify him to see whats up. maurice is under the impression that this friday is going get a major promotion and has decided he’s going treat himself to a nice brand new toy…a brand new ford raptor. thankfully the car gods have given us the exact model in options and color that maurice wants. which of course is the reason why maurice is at my store and not wanting to leave my store without the truck, however isn’t understanding his coupon does not qualify for the ford raptor and that he should be happy we are only charging him sticker on a truck that traditionally sells for above sticker. i of course try to explain this to maurice who calls me a scumbag. this is of course the short version, and maurice is being a general douche. i do some quick thinking look up to maurice and say “if i honor the pricing agreement that you believe i should honor will you purchase today?” maurice happily responds yes! so i have finance start up the paperwork and several times throughout this process i over hear maurice insulting my employees, dealership, and reputation. this is something i do not tolerate. in my opinion the most important asset which i have are my employees they generate the revenue which pays my bills. however i was going let this one slide till the very end! finally maurice is done with finance, the vehicle is funded and he’s ready for delivery. i tell the operations manager i’ll personally handle this delivery and he calls me over as soon as the walk around is ready. so i begin showing maurice all the options and features that the ford raptor offers. he’s like a kid in a fucking candy store, so happy with his purchase. still thinks we are scumbags though! finally we are done, the paperwork is signed maurice is sitting in his brand new truck and i’m standing outside of it when i saw me: hey, tony is the guy that will be promoting you on friday right? maurice: yea, do you know him? me: sure do, he's my younger brother maurice...really? me: yup, in fact many years ago when tony was just a small startup i convinced the owner of this dealership to finance his company. i am confident without our support tony would of gone bankrupt in the early days of the dot com bubble. maurice...i didn’t know…i’m so sorry for… me: nah don’t worry about it, you go ahead and enjoy your new truck now. poor boy wanted to cry i was grinning from ear to ear. got into my office called in the sales person, his manager and even finance (who this guy also treated like shit) and called up my younger brother tony... allen really enjoyed his new promotion and used the bonus to pay off his house and put a massive down payment on his first rental property. editted: i tried to clean it up, i'm a pretty shitty writer. saw this and thought it belonged here. (seems more professional than petty to me but, hey...) &gt;[–]prnmeds 1 day ago* registered nurse here: my manager doesn't do a good job of being personable, and comes across very robotic. its difficult for me because my intrinsic drive doesn't respond well to criticism, even of the constructive type (which she doesn't usually provide, she's more a negative criticism type of manager). i received an e-mail from her on my day off full of passive aggressive bullshit about how i had made a mistake. a physician had wanted a patient to go for a test and the patient needed to follow certain instructions: take this medicine the night before, then nothing by mouth after midnight type of instructions. the order went in at 10pm, i work 3p-1130p. the nurse coming on for the night shift didn't communicate with the patient that they weren't supposed to eat/drink after midnight and the test was unable to take place. i didn't recognize the name of the patient in the e-mail, and went back and checked the patient assignments for that particular day. as it turns out, i wasn't the nurse taking care of that patient. my day off had been ruined by thinking i had screwed up when i wasn't even involved. i sent her an response letting her know that i had nothing to do with the care of that patient. i also informed her that it was a direct violation of that patients hipaa rights (private health information/privacy act) for her to have shared with me (a person who had absolutely nothing to do with the patients care) both the patients name, what he was being seen in the hospital for and specific details about the tests that were going to be performed on him. i told her i regretfully had an obligation to report the incident to medical records because a breach of privacy had occurred and included a screenshot from the mandatory bullshit training we do online every year about phi (private health information). preface - i read this on a russian forum and i'm translating it here. i have no way to verify whether this is true or not, but the forum is somewhat reliable, and the revenge is amazing. for a bit of context, the russian military has special days for different branches of service, where veterans of those branches get shitfaced and act like idiots. there are border guards day, tanker day, paratrooper day, and a few others. here's the actual story. once upon a time, on august 2nd, a sad story took place in our town. 3 drunken paratroopers ganged up on a middle-aged azerbaijani man, called him slurs and beat him up. the paratroopers made a mistake. timur sultanovich isn't a "churka" (a racist slur), but a well-respected and a well-connected man. he's well respected enough and well-connected enough to have the 3 culprits licking his shoes clean the next day. but uncle timur (as everyone calls him) is a kind man. they'll punish themselves, he said. all it took is a few meetings, some phone calls and a bit of money (relatively), and next year... next year on august 1st, a new brand of vodka was delivered to all stores in the town. it was called paratrooper, it was very cheap, and had a label with an image of a paratrooper smashing a bottle over his head (as is tradition - you've seen the youtubes). the next day over 200 idiots were hospitalized on paratrooper day, some with concussions, some with cranial trauma and fractures from trying to break the bottle over their heads. the bottles were made of thick tempered glass. this whole things started like 12 years ago (i’m 25 right now). back then, i was kind of the kid who was bullied by the “cool guys”. i never had the best grades, but never had much friends, maybe i just wore the wrong clothes, i don’t know. there was one guy especially who never let a day pass without insulting me until he left the school for what ever reason. some years later, i was 20 at that point. i managed to finish school and worked for an design agency as an intern. everyday we get a lot of stuff via parcel service. basically we design stuff for clients and let it produce by what ever company gives us the best offer. all this stuff comes to us first, so we can take a look at the quality and send in to our customer. this stuff can be heavy. our rooms are located in the second floor, so it’s standard procedure that the parcel guy rings the bell and one of the interns goes down, opens the door and help the underpaid guy to bring the stuff all the way up. time goes by and every time the parcel guy rings the bell, i went downstairs to help him carry that stuff up. until one day. i opened the door and there he stands. this waste of organs an blood who never let a day pass without making my life hell back in school. he looked at me without recognizing who i am, telling me he has some stuff for us and if i mind helping him to bring the stuff upstairs. i signed and instead of helping him bringing this two dozen packages of ordered paper blocks upstairs (and believe me, paper can be fucking heavy) i just told him the way, stepping outside and lit a cigarette, while telling him where he should carry all this shit. he was not really happy to do all this on his own. after delivering the last package, he passed me standing outside, while smoking my third cigarette in a row (normally i don’t smoke that much, but i had to look cool :d), just waiting for that moment when he passes me to go back to his car. the moment he passed me i said: ‘maybe you don’t remember, but karma does…’. he turns around and looked me straight in the eyes and in this one moment i could see in his eyes that he recognized me. he walked straight to his car without saying a word. after that, i saw him every other day since. and when ever he is the guy who delivers all that stuff for us, i stand outside and smoking a cigarette. this went on for another two years. he never changed a word with me, nor did he looked me in the eyes. since than i’m working there full-time and we have another interns. the first thing i teach them, whenever this one guy rings the bell to bring us our delivery, don’t even think about helping him, just sit outside and watch. sorry for my english, i’am not a native speaker, hope you enjoyed this anyways!this took place over a decade ago but after discovering this gem of a subreddit, i needed to share. growing up my friends were all about tping houses. this involves throwing toilet paper over the house, bushes, trees, etc. although we thought this was fun, even at the age of 16 we knew there were limitations as to how often you should do this because even though the joke is on the friend, the parents are the ones dealing with the mess. so we had a rule: one person can get tp’d once a summer, no exceptions. if you were caught, you were required to help pick it up. that being said, one “friend” didn’t respect the rule. for an entire summer my parent’s house was tp’d literally every weekend over the summer without fail. i didn’t know who was doing it or who to trust until i came home late one night to see my buddy’s brother (we’ll call him bb) driving off in his car flipping me the bird. after calling him out on it, he openly and happily admitted he was the culprit of the summer’s mystery tp asshole. bb did not like me and i did not like him. he stole my ex-girlfriend. he would shoot me with a paintball gun when i rolled up to his parent’s house. he thought smacking someone in the nuts was a good time. put simply, we was a dick in every sense of the word. bb had one thing he loved more than anything, even more than dangling his dick on your face while you slept. his obsession was his red 1998 ford svt cobra mustang. this car was his baby and his obsession. if he wasn’t busy degrading someone’s existence, he was in the garage spending his parents money on his car. when he admitted to pounding my house with tp, he was happy to announce he was doing it to my best friend’s house regularly (we’ll call him bff). bff and i ended up telling our parents about it (they are friends). when my dad found out, he handed me his costco card and bff’s dad handed him a $100 bill and he said “do what needs to be done”. we bought 10 pounds of flour, two costco sized bags of tp and a thing called cat-fish sewer bait – the worst smelling substance in the world. 100% honest: i would rather eat a spoonful of shit than eat a spoonful of that. one afternoon i ended up going to bb’s house to hang with his brother. when i was alone, i snagged a pair of keys to his brothers car (they hung them inside the door). we snuck back to his house that night and here’s what we did: 1.) at least 4 pound of flower was poured through via a funnel into the air vents. no idea how that panned out. 2.) the sewer bait was put in the section of the car that airflow came into for ac and heat (don’t ask me how, that was bff who pulled that off). the smell was enough to make my buddy puke. 3.) we tp’d the shit out of his house. i mean everywhere… the house, the back garage, the pond out front, the trees surrounding their house and the trees in the yard. if it would hold tp, we put it there… 2 costco sized bags of double rolled tp. that night it rained and the tp became paste. as for the car, my buddy told me that his brother (bb) sold it after bringing it to the dealership multiple times to get it fixed. he sold the car for about ½ it’s worth and was forced to drive his grandma’s buick. in hindsight i was a huge asshole… but when you’re in rome, do as the romans do. tl;dr: my buddy has a brother that is an ass and i made his car smell like death.the ex: ex wife was psychologically abusive to me and the kids, was a consummate liar and manipulator and did all she could to ruin me financially during and after the marriage. she also tried vey hard, and was successful for a few years at turning the kids against me. she was (and still is) a nasty hypocrite. the back story: while married to her she was in the hospital for a minor accident and while in the hospital she asked me to help her out of bed so she could look in the mirror to see if she had bruises on her face from the minor accident. i helped her out of bed and while at the mirror and in front of the sink, she fainted and fell before i could catch her. she hit her head on the sink and the fall broke her wrist when she landed on it. i called the nurse and subequently they stitched up her lip and set her wrist. a year or so later she contacted a lawyer to sue the hospital. meanwhile we get divorced. the divorce is nasty and she is nasty. she tries to get me arrested many times when i try to see the kids on scheduled times. she contacted all of my friends and tried to turn them away from me. she hassled my parents and sisters, first trying to be their frind and try to turn them against me and when that didn't work, she attacked them with nasty phone calls and baseless accusations. meanwhile her malpractice suit is proceeding and her lawyer wanted me to give a deposition to support it. i agree, but on the condition that they have to pay me for my time and costs. the revenge: at the deposition i was supposed to support their claim that the ex was not given instuctions about staying in bed and that the bed-rails were not put up as a reminder for her to stay in bed and that consequently it was the hospital's fault that she was able to get up and then faint and fall. i said that i didn't remember any of that; that she demanded that she get up and that i help her and that we were not going to wait for the nurse to help. in my deposition i told the truth as i remembered it. my memory did not support her malpractice claim. afterwards her lawyer dropped her case based on my deposition and tried to hit her up for costs, but she screwed him like she did everyone else. **tl:dr my deposition scuttled her malpractice claim.**my dad is a pretty lovely honest guy, but looks like a complete criminal and has a vein of insaneness in him that he tamed with age, and in general has a don't fuck with me aura i picked up on since i was in elementary school. i thought you'd like a few stories of the kind of revenge he got when he was younger and less... responsible. stories come from him, my mother and grandmother. this one is my favourite: back when military was compulsory in my country, my dad, like everyone else, had to serve at 18. so he gets called up in this base very far away from home. he is the only one there not from the area, he looks different, has a different accent, doesn't know anyone, is very young. so people start fucking with him. this one bully in particular really starts getting on his nerves. so one night, when they are in the "massive" bedroom, with most beds, and this guy is bullying my dad with his friends, my dad goes up to this guy, really close to his face, and tells him "next time you pull this shit again, i will set you on fire". they start laughing at him and making even more fun of him. day after, it's bedtime again. this guy waits for my dad to fall asleep, and teabags him. my dad wakes up. everyone is in tears from laughing. my dad calmly lights up a cigarette. then he reaches for something. he was storing some gasoline. the guy went to sit on his bed in the meanwhile. my dad throws a bunch of gasoline on top of him while he starts freaking out. throws the cigarette on him. guy goes on fire, they manage to stop it before it gets too dangerous, he still gets some burns. everyone was so freaked out they claimed it was an accident, too afraid to tell on my dad. had no problems after that. another time, he was with my mom at the beach (they were pretty young, 19 or 20). it was the 2 of them. my dad was trying to get some sleep, my mom was sunbathing. a group of guys walk past, and one of them slaps my mom's ass. like my dad wasn't there. guy tells my dad "what you gonna do about it?" i guess they felt there was safety in numbers. my dad doesn't say a word. he gets up, takes the metal tube umbrella out of the sand, and starts beating the everliving fuck out of that guy until he is half passed out. he then stares down his friends until they leave. another time, back when he was in school, the principals' son was a real dickhead, always bullying smaller weaker younger kids. my dad couldn't take his shit, he's always hated injustice. so one day while this kid who felt like god was bullying some poor little kid, my dad went up to him, and told him to stop. the kid ignored him. my dad told him "if you are so brave, why don't you come and do that with someone your own size?" the kid just laughed at him and told him to mind his own fucking business if he didnt want him to "tell his dad". the kid kept berating the other smaller child who was almost in tears. so my dad went up to the kid, pushed him on the ground, and started kicking him. after the kid looked pretty hurt, my dad got him in a lock and started slapping his butt infront of everyone and told him "go on, tell your dad, call your dad!" the kid started screaming "daaaad come pleeease" like a banshee, until a teacher did call the principal. he came and got my dad off his son, and called my grandma into school. so the kid told his story, highly skewed. my dad kept cool and told what actually happened. the principal was furious. (this was back in the day when stuff like this would get you a small suspension at most). my dad told how everything went. to which my grandma told the principal: "i know my son. he is not a lier, and absolutely not a bully. your son had it coming. tell him to learn how to behave, because my son won't tolerate that kind of behaviour, and i fully support him". my badass grandma then just went home with my dad, and told him to make sure there are no witnesses next time he kicks his ass. i am not nearly as interesting, but i figured you'd like some of my old man stories :d this happened to my uncle recently. he was crossing the road taking his young sons home from their music lesson, when an erratic driver almost ran over the first son. as the driver got out of his car, my uncle proceeded to give the driver a piece of his mind, to which the driver responded by effin' and jeffin' at my uncle and his son. rather than escalating further, my uncle took note of the driver's work uniform, and after the driver went on his way, my uncle went to the driver's workplace, informed his employers, who informed my uncle that he would be fired in the morning, who was already on his last legs!so i got a call from my boyfriend who seemed really upset after auditing a class at his college. he prefaced it by telling me that he almost killed a man today. i laughed it off because he is too sweet and could never hurt anybody. it turns out that he was in a class in which a “true ‘merican” from texas(referred to as craig) was spewing his ideals that west african people who are suffering from the ebola outbreak deserve their fate. craig honestly believed that those countries deserved the virus because “they can’t care for their citizens.” as fate would have it, my boyfriend, being from guinea, was very shocked that anybody could say those beliefs and write off a group of people (especially people craig did not know). my boyfriend is not mean or spiteful and literally has never even killed a spider in my presence. i think this hurt him a lot more than he was willing to admit. he told me that he wanted to say something to the professor and classmates, but the moment passed. the class was then grouped off to discuss something. craig was paired off with a girl but she refused to be in his group (she was from sri lanka). my boyfriend walked over to be partners with him. at introduction my boyfriend reached out and firmly grabbed craig’s hand and continued to hold it. my boyfriend then looked deep into craig’s eyes and said “i’m from guinea,” and paused. seeing no recognition in craig’s eyes, my boyfriend added with a smile, “which is in west africa. i have been in america for 3 weeks.” but in fact, he has been here for over a year. craig didn’t need to know that though. craig started freaking out. he sat down and my boyfriend could see this young man visibly shaking and sweat pouring out of him. the class stopped what they were doing and stared at craig and my boyfriend. they asked what happen and my boyfriend told them that he didn't know. now he is afraid that he is going to get in trouble for lying. he said he felt like he almost gave craig a heart attack. but i had to share this, it is too great. i created this account just to tell this story. i know he won’t get in trouble. *edit- my boyfriend is seriously considering not going to class next monday, because he is certain that he is going to get harassed. i'm secretly hoping he doesn't go so it will make craig think he died.  i don't yell at my students, i say "good morning", remember names and honour birthdays, i'm there after school for two hours every day, i answer their questions to the best of my ability, i offer them musical challenges, i gave them free fridays of cartoons and snacks for high test scores and good behaviour. i started started a little band that played during parent nights. i was even the musician at one of my student's mother's funeral. that week, i have no idea how they soured. no one wanted to tell who did what, so i treated them as a group. edit: the word revenge. i didn't mean it as a super villain picking on innocents (or non-guilty parties). i'm not the best with words, but i felt there had to be some form of consequence. a multiple choice test and extra projects to raise grades? that's not evil. i'm not spanking children here. i, a high school music teacher/ choir direct, am fed up with my classes. i took a short vacation came back to a nasty letter from my sub. someone spilled apple juice on my piano and ruined a few octaves. the glass for my favourite framed drawing was cracked. two chairs broke. my guitar is missing a string. and most of them didn't do the worksheets i left behind. final exams are around the corner, so i decided to get revenge with my test. i know, that sounds awful, but i believe my music students don't deserve to get off easy. i'm planning a hundred-question exam, which must be done in one class period. no study guide will be given, as the exam will cover what i've taught since the first week of school. i have eight-six students in all, so i decided to create three questions per student. however, i will permute the questions so that no two students will have the same test. questions won't be too easy to answer either. not only a test, but homework assignments every night until the end of the school year. then on top of that, they'll have to create a 16-bar melody. i'm pretty sure they've experienced harder teachers than me, but all i ask is for a little respect here and there. i live in a state with constant signature-gathering efforts as a result of our much-abused citizen initiative system. most signature gatherers are pushy, but in an accustomed sort of way. you see one ahead you drop your shades, 'take a phone call,' anything to avoid them. for the most part they acquiesce, but not this one time... my kids and i were downtown, walking from the bus stop to one of the enormo-multi-plexes that typically host popular kids' films. it was a nice night and we were having a good time. transiting a large public plaza i spy a chubby, middle-aged male signature gatherer standing near the corner ahead. the gods of timing are not with us and we are stopped by the 'don't walk' sign. this is clearly his method: the captive audience. in all honesty i can't blame him. we'd be stuck at the crosswalk with him for 20s, no more. as soon as we stop he launches into his spiel. after a moment or two i politely tell him "not tonight, man" and return my attention to my kids. he immediately replies "no, tonight" and pokes me in the chest with the clipboard. [mrw.]( i am what cedric the entertainer called a ["grown-ass man."]( nobody's going to try and make me look like a chump, let alone in front of my kids. my first reaction upon being poked in the chest by this tool was to slap the clipboard out of his fat little hands. however, to do so would be to set what i knew to be an inappropriately violent &amp; confrontational personal standard for public behavior for my kids, so in the words of oran "juice" jones ["instead, i chilled."]( i did however happen to have a black sharpie in the leg pocket of my carhartts. i looked the offending shitlord in the eye and said "sure, i'll sign. give it to me." rather than use the ballpoint attached to the clipboard by a cunning array of knotted rubber bands, i opted for my own pen, found the first open signature blank, and wrote "fuck you" in giant black letters the length of the signature entry. the whole episode had eaten up our wait time at this point. the moment the walk signal turned i handed the clipboard back to mr. pushy &amp; stepped into the crosswalk. talking and laughing with my kids i never looked back, and they were never aware of the time their dad rolled some instant karma on a douchebag who tried to harsh the family buzz. ed: "to subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill." -sun tzuanother person's mailbox story reminded me of this one. when i was in highschool a friend of mine was dating this sweet little girl that we all got along with. but this girl had an ex boyfriend who was a real piece of shit. threatened to beat my friend's ass a couple times (never followed through), harassed her, told everyone she had laid down with him and other stuff. just an all around dick. the girl did a great job of ignoring his bullshit, which pissed him off even more. well one day her family comes out of their house and sees their mailbox has been ran down and someone had driven across their lawn. her dad righted it and straightened it out, just for it to be ran down again a few days late. everyone assumed it was scumbag, but there was no proof to be had. scumbag had made one error in judgement though. and that was the girl's dad was a retired welder with nothing but time on his hands. this man spent hours building this beautiful mailbox out of 1/2 steel sheets. he then mounted it on a steel pole filled with concrete and painted the whole thing red and black to conceal the monstrosity it really was. a week went by with no progress and we were disheartened that maybe scumbag had given it up. but then one late night the family is woken up to a smash outside. scumbag had slammed into it again and the mailbox had gone clear through the radiator of his truck. end game is scumbag is arrested for dui, underage drinking and i am sure a whole list of other shit. two jackasses with him are charged too. mailbox just had to be straightened out and repainted and was still in service when i left town a few years later. i used to do freelance translating work a few years ago, and i finished a project for 1,200 word technical manual for an indian client that had good reviews on their industry profile (proz). now normally payment for freelance translations can range between 30 to 60 days, and under my contract they had 60 days to pay for the amount. fast forward to 65th day since i delivered the project, and i didn't hear anything from them. after multiple phone calls, e-mails, and skype messages, i received no word from the client so i decided to give up, write a negative review on proz, and move on. after about 6 months i get an e-mail from the same company asking me to complete another translation project, i guess they had forgotten about me. "now here's an opportunity," i thought. i took on the assignment, completed it on time, except when it was time to send in the assignment i didn't, and waited. surely enough a couple hours from the deadline the translation company was frantically trying to reach me, sending multiple e-mails and even going so far as trying to call my american number. they were freaking out because the project was due for their client on that very same day, and if they didn't get it they would lose their business with them. i gladly responded, saying that "hey, remember that freelancer you stood up 6 months ago, yeah that's me. i have your project ready to go, but you need to pay me for my previous work plus interest, as well as for this assignment before you get this project." and what do you know, the money was in my account half an hour later.to understand db you might want to check out he is a super huge prolife person. one of my friends had to have an abortion because either she or the child would die. db found out and told her she is going to hell and will meet her baby there. he also went out and harassed her husband saying that he should not have let her have an abortion. it is up to the man of the house to lay down the law. super douchey. lets go back in time to 2009. this was a time before db showed his true colors. i was chatting with db on facebook and we go to talking about sex. i said i was in quite a "drought". 5 minutes later db shows up at my apartment and we..... you know.... cut to about 4 weeks later i had an cut the tip of my finger off while making a smoothie. it was a holiday weekend and pretty much everyone i knew was out of town. my mom was in europe, sister in a different state, about 20 of my friends were on a vacation together (i had to stay home and work :( ) i could not drive to the hospital. i was seeing spots and feeling like i was going to throw up. i call db and he doesn't answer. fine whatever. then i hear a ping. he sent me a text. it said "you are my whore. not the other way around. you don't get to decide when we bang" ....... wtf. i needed a ride to the hospital. not a ride on his penis. whatever. i end up calling 911 and getting a nice expensive ride to the hospital. yay for ambulances. now lets travel back to 2014. i write db an email. i say that i am trying to have a closer relationship with god (which is a lie). i need to tell him something so i can be closer with our heavenly father. i tell him that when we hooked up years ago i got pregnant. i called him on that holiday weekend because i did not know if i should get an abortion or not. when he didn't pick up the phone i thought that he did not care for our unborn child. i had an abortion and killed our child because i could not get ahold of you. he read it and calls me crying. how could he let me kill our child?!?!?! why didn't he do anything!!!!!!!! [and i be like]( - i'll preface this by saying that i am a heroin/meth addict in recovery. i'm not proud of the things i did, but i got a kick out of this at the time. a couple years ago i was out driving around doing my thing, i had just scored some excellent black tar from my dealer. i decided to call my buddy (we can call him jay) to hang out and get high with me. so i went to go meet him in the parking lot of some scummy mexican restaurant in central phoenix. i pull in and notice that he had someone else with him, so i drove up to them and he insists that this kid needed to come too (and i mean kid, this little prick looked like he had just gotten out of middle school. we'll call him chris). chris had some meth on him and at the time i wasn't at all morally opposed to enabling hardcore drug usage among minors so i figured, why not? after a grimy session of speedballing i dropped them both off at chris' moms house. when i was pulling into chris' street i took note of a comment he made about how he had stolen several hundred dollars worth of copper wire from his stepfather who was an electrician a few days prior. about two weeks later i encountered the dreaded bi-monthly event that took place in my junkie life style: my dealer wasn't responding to my texts. i called jay and he said i should send chris a facebook message (he didn't have a phone, he was using an ipod touch to communicate). apparently chris had a dealer that lived a few blocks from his moms house. desperate as fuck to not be writhing in the pain of opiate withdrawal, i caved in to my reluctance and decided to meet chris at a gas station near his moms house. long story short, this little piece of shit ran off with my $50. "but he was coming right back". lol. it wasn't entirely unexpected, but you'd think that, as a 21 year old 170 pound guy that knows where you live, it would be safer just to take the finders fee. apparently he forgot that i knew where he lived because he didn't respond to any of my facebook messages for 45 minutes until i typed in the name of his street and told him i'll see him in a few minutes. he typed me this bullshit story about how he got robbed and that he would pay me back in a couple days. i'm generally a nice guy and i'd rather avoid conflict, especially with a 15 year old kid, so i agreed. a few days went by and no word from him, i messaged him about it but i didn't get a response. i was just going to drop it, until jay told me the kid was bragging about stealing my money. this is the point that i realized i must have my revenge. i drove over to his moms house and knocked on the door. a middle-aged woman answered, obviously startled by my disheveled appearance yet politefully asked "can i help you?" i replied "yes, are you chris' mom?" she looked incredibly worried and confirmed that she was indeed the birthing unit of this little hellspawn. i straightened my posture and put on my best 'concerned parent' face and said, "i'm the brother of one of his friends. i recently discovered that your son and my brother have been using crystal meth together, and i'm very concerned about the both of them. i didn't know if you knew or not (by this time she looked like she was about to shit a brick) but i thought i'd at least try to let you guys know so you can get him some help." she welcomed me inside for coffee, (chris wasn't home) and i suggested that she check chris for needle marks and gave her details about how he had stolen the copper wire from her husband's work van. i heard from jay the next day that chris was being shipped off to florida for some sort of long-term inpatient treatment program. peace out fucker. i'm here to talk about the battle for my small community park. this kerfuffle involves a large community and parent group and a bigoted protester, who we shall call pm (park man). &amp;nbsp; every morning on weekdays pm parks his pickup truck with a massive home made sign on the back, right on the side of one of my town's busiest roads and most popular park - just to ensure his ideologies are spread - until late into the evening. now, there is nothing wrong with spreading your own message, but park man took it to the extreme and eventually, the town snapped. pm started his campaign a while ago, when obama was first elected. he started off erecting signs with the usual "obama is an illegal president, he is trying to take over the nation, etc." of course, there is nothing wrong with spreading your own political views, but pm realized that posting his political views was not simply enough to get the public attention and decided to escalate. he began to embellish his sign with much more hurtful, much more racist messages such as "islams will all go to hell, obama is the devil, and muhammad is a pedophile." during my towns gay pride parade, pm sat on a street corner and spewed bullshit out of his mouth for hours, calling the marchers faggots and damning them to hell. recently, he drew the last straw by flying blown up images of aborted fetuses for everyone - including children playing in the park, to see. &amp;nbsp; now, if pm was protesting in the deep south, he might have been okay, but my town, hilo, is extremely liberal, peaceful, and tolerant of pretty much anything except extreme bigotry, racism, and violence. furthermore, many parents stopped taking their kids to the park to avoid the racist messages and sometimes graphic images on the sidewalk 20 feet away. despite being extremely offensive, everything pm does is protected by his right to free speech so the recent protests and petitions started by the community to oust him meant nothing. and so, pm persisted and even gained a small group of supporters. &amp;nbsp; something needed to be done, and the community came up with a beautifully simple solution. they realized that all though pm was protected by free speech, the parking spot pm used for his billboard was not. for the past couple of weeks, a big group of concerned parents and other community members wake up early and snag all of the parking lots by the park, and then leave when the park closes. people working on nearby shops now leave their cars by the park and walk to work, and some parents spend the whole day at the park with their cars in pm's beloved parking space, preaching peace and tolerance. for the past two weeks, the park has been free from pm's truck, his signs, and the his small group of followers, making my town just a little bit better. &amp;nbsp; tldr: extremely racist man's right to free speech is protected but his right to a parking space is not. &amp;nbsp; edit: maybe i will post this on /r/pettyrevenge, i suck at finding subreddits and i thought this was the place. i also found some videos and articles, but they directly name pm so idk if i should post them.time: late 70's place: a medium size midwestern town players: me, an electrical contractor and guido the hot shot from new york city. (probably bayonne, but who cares?) set up: guido has shown up in town and announces he going to open up the first disco in town. he's flying on borrowed money, spends a ton on advertising and promotion, rents a big space in a big strip mall and proceeds to hire local contractors to build his disco. i come in with a 4 man crew to do all his electrical. it takes two weeks and then some because he keeps asking for more stuff and i oblige. come payday, two days before his grand opening, i come in with an invoice for ~$3.6k expecting payment in full. we sit down at a table, he and i, along with some 200 lbs meatball who is a local i recognize. he offers me $350 cash for the whole job. he argues that we didn't have anything on paper so i could take it or leave it. i think about it for a minute and decide to accept so he gets up to go fetch the cash. while he's gone i look over at meatball with a questioning look and as if he knows what i'm going to ask he said "yes, i'm here to keep you from beating his ass". he furthered volunteered that i wasn't the only one. i collect the $350 and leave. opening night the parking lot is filling up, there's a line at the door and guido is up front collecting his door ($10 a head) and i pull up in my 1 ton all the way around by the back door. i rig a chain and a pallet on the back door so he can't come out the back, wrap a 1" poly rope around the riser on his service, tie the other end to my back bumper and jerk his meter clean off the wall making a huge shower of sparks, buzzing and pops then calmly drive back around front and park at a fair distance from the front door. after a minute or two of silence and darkness from the club people start spilling out demanding refunds. apparently he wasn't interested in giving out refunds so after a few more minutes i saw 6 or 7 coked up rednecks drag him into the parking lot and beat the crap out of him, empty his pockets and leave him laying there on the curb. he left town inside of 24 hours. but wait! there's more!! in a similar incident a couple of years later i got stiffed by a shitty biker bar for a couple of service calls. not that much money or as big a deal, but they threw a beer bottle at my van as i was driving away and the dent just set me off. i came back at dusk on a friday night about a week later, parked on the other side of the shopping center, set up a ladder and carried my wire shears across the roof and snipped their power lines right at the weatherhead and left. they called the power company who came out, found the stubs sticking out of the weatherhead too short to connect to and told them they needed an electrician to come replace their riser before they could reconnect. ever try to find an electrician on a friday night? or a saturday or sunday? lol it took until monday before the lights and coolers were back on. i toasted about $400 worth of beer in their coolers plus their whole weekend take. moral of the story: do ***not*** fuck with your electrician. ps: just for edification, i didn't have this kind of problem very often. i made most of my money off oil fields and only ran service calls to keep a truck/sparky combo busy.i heard this one from a friend of mine who is a trucker. although i can't prove that it is true, the guy is an honest friend and hasn't made any shit up during the time i've known him. anyway, i figured i'd post it here. he was sitting in a long traffic jam on i-24 between nashville and chattanooga, tennessee after drinking a lot of caffeine/water/soda. since the traffic was at a dead stop, and he had to pee, he took a ziplock baggie from the back of his sleeper cab and emptied his entire bladder into it. he zipped it up and got back into the driver's seat. fast forward about 20 minutes: he still hasn't made any progress, but his cb radio started going crazy. anybody who has a driver's license has probably witnessed the self entitled assholes who drive on the shoulder of the interstate in order to get in front of traffic. by doing this, they are frequently blocking the only emergency access to the wreck. these people piss me off, as well as every trucker sitting in traffic. so he was hearing reports of 2 mustangs, riding with the tops down, with a bunch of frat douches coming up the shoulder at about 50 mph. he had a brilliant idea. remember the ziplock bag of piss? he got into the passenger seat of the truck, rolled down the window, and waited until the mustangs were in clear view. as they reached his truck, he threw the bag of piss out the window. it slammed into the windshield of the first mustang, spraying his trucker piss all over the frat douche passengers. they then proceeded to take the next exit...hopefully to clean off all of the piss that had just coated them. he got a round of cheers on the cb radio that day. edit: my gremaer is baddmy mom, brother and i lived in a tiny shitty rented apartment owned by her half sister. in the beginning, she knew we were looking for a place to stay and begged for us to rent her unit because she needed the money desperately. this aunt is not close to us, barely meet in 18 years, she lives at her daughter's place and allowed us to rent the whole unit, and considering she's a family member, it's a good deal we thought. we only had to pay the rental and deposit or some shit for in the situation of if we move out without notice. on one of those months, aunt couldn't afford to pay the utility bills (for rubbish, maintenance etc) and my mom offered to help for that one particular month only, even though it wasn't part of the rental agreement. but the following month when utility was behind on payment again, aunt gave mom a stern warning telling her to pay on time. she somehow automatically assumes mom will pay it each month for her just because she did it as a favour once. this means mom will have to pay like an extra $100 on top of the rental cost each month but she's a nice person, she didn't mind and wanted to help out my aunt, thinking she's having financial difficulties and plus she's a family member, we cannot say no or else word will spread. in my country, the government will give rebates once every year in the form of something like $200 voucher to be used to pay the light and water bills. bare in mind, it's just a piece of paper, it's just a voucher that minus $200 from the bills, you dont see the money. every single 21 and above citizen will receive this for their household, but if you don't have a house, you simply don't need to use it. but aunt texted my mom and asked for it in cash. she said "since you don't need the voucher and its my house, give me the money" it's ridiculous because the government gives this to everyone, and it's just a voucher to cut down the bills, how can she ask for ours in cash. her logic was that the rebates are to be used if you have a house and considering we live in her house, she thinks it's rightfully hers. she said she needed the money to celebrate eid mubarak, but we are a muslim family too we needed the money to celebrate eid too. again, mom was pissed but too nice to say anything and gave her the $200 she think she's entitled to. she's a relative and we didn't want issues. the next year when the government gave the same rebate, aunt asked for the same thing but including the amount of the voucher my brother and i received. so mom got incredibly pissed and told my aunt off but aunt pretended she didn't know the voucher was just a paper and not cash. from this point on there was visible tension and she hated us because she knew she can't trick my mom into giving more money. for 3 years she continually try to suck more money out from us because she knows we rather pay extra than have to look for a new place. after 3 years since moving in, one night we had the rest of the family over for dinner, like 4 of them including my brother's fiance, sister and her husband who dont live with us and our family friend. after dinner we mused ourselves with the one finger lifting trick. it's basically a party trick where one participant will lie flat on the floor and 4 people will lift the person up using one 1 finger each, something to do with weight distribution. you can google it, it's a fun activity. basically we recorded ourselves doing it for shits and giggles and i posted the video on facebook. but my aunt found the video from a tip off by another relative and started commenting that we were having a "disco" and "the doors and windows are open. you are letting the neighbours see and embarrassing us." 1 whole day later she gave my mom an angry phone call which went like this aunt: "do you know your daughter is on facebook?" (i was 20 years old at the time, wtf?" mom: "yes i know" aunt: "do you know she has photos with her father?" (parents are divorce but she thinks im not suppose to talk to my dad and take photos with him) mom: "so?" aunt: "i saw the black magic video, they are not suppose to do that in my house and its embarrassing me. are you aware of what they are doing?" mom: "yes so? i've seen it." aunt: "youre a muslim lady and you wear a scarf over your head. how can you allow your daughter to dress like that? when she leaves the house, the neighbours see and it's embarrassing me" mom then hangup the phone. it's really not her business in what i do, or how i dress or whether or not i have contact with my father because this lady is just a distant relative. we simply rent her house that's all, she does not have any right to comment on my life. the night we had family over was just a small gathering and we were not being noisy. the end of the month, mom did the usual thing and went to aunt's place to pay for the rental and she, along with her daughter, gang up on my mom with some bullshit about having to sell the house we're living in because the housing board changed some policy or method of payment which my aunt is not willing to do, so they have to sell it in 3 months unless we can fork out more money to continue staying there. she told us to be gone by november too if we can't pay more. mom just smiled and said ok. we know it's just bullshit and no such new policy, they are just threatening to sell the house if we cant pay extra rent money. that week we packed up our shit and moved to my sister's place. we didn't need to give her any notice or warning because she told us to be gone by november. after we moved, she told my uncle that we owe her 3 months worth of rent (payment til november which she feels entitled to because she thinks we are supposed to live there til november altho never mentioned it and only told us to leave as soon as we can. november was just a deadline she made) but when we called her to verify this claim, she said she owed us the deposit money instead which she must give back to us for making us leave. aunt was greedy. she was never going to sell the house. she simply didn't like us because we refuse to give her the government rebate and so she was tried to make us pay extra. she knew we were desperate for a house in the past and thought we were going to do anything and pay any amount to continue living in her shit house now. she never thought we were capable of moving out and we are her only source of income so she immediately regretted it and told my mom that they cancelled plans of selling the house and begged for mom to stay. so the revenge is this: we played by her rules but moved out without any hint or warning which means bitch aunt didn't realise she needed to start paying the house on her own and she couldnt because we are her only source of income, she is heavily in debt now, nobody wants to rent her apartment because it's in such a shitty condition, and on top of that she also have to pay us the deposit money back which she is struggling to do and has not fully pay back 2 years later. so i passed a guy going 60 mph in the left lane to get around him. this jerk turns on his brights and starts tailgating me for about 5 miles or so. eventually he cuts in front of me and starts going 60 mph again. i get into the right lane and speed up. the guy speeds up too, this continues til we are both going about 85 mph. i think to myself "whatever i'm going the speed i want to go". then waze informs me there is a cop car up ahead. i wait for a minute until i can see the cop. i hit the gas, which in my car revs my engine loudly but doesn't immediately cause a speed increase. jerk hits the gas too and since his car is nicer than mine immediately speeds up to about 110 mph. i slow down to the speed limit. 110 mph is considered reckless driving in my state. can you guess what happened next? yup, the statie turns his lights on and pulls jerkface mcgee over. enjoy your reckless driving charge!hello. i've recently graduated from college, but have no job, so i got an apartment at a shitty complex. now, just because it's a crappy complex doesn't mean i shouldn't have a functioning apartment; i do pay rent after all. i had been on the landlord's case for about a month to fix my slow drains and non-operative electrical outlets in the apartment. when my toilet clogged, things came to a head. i went down to the office to tell them about the toilet problem. while i was there, i also complained about the slow sink and outlets again. they said it would be at least two weeks until someone would come fix my stuff. when i asked why it was going to take so long, they said it was because maintenance was too busy turning over apartments for new tenants. that pissed me off pretty bad. so i decided to relieve them of any new tenants. maybe with no new tenants coming in, they would have time to fix my apartment that i pay them good money for every month. so i went to the drugstore, and i got one of those poster kits. it took me about fifteen minutes to make a poster that said in real big letters, "so-and-so is a deadbeat landlord." then i took my sign, and stood on the sidewalk in front of their leasing office. i know i turned away at least 3 people who were seriously thinking about renting there. new tenants are so valuable to this company that they'll take $500 off the rent of anyone who refers a new tenant. i stood out there for one full business day. the very next morning, maintenance was banging down my door trying to fix shit for me. apparently the way to get stuff done around here is by cutting off the flow of new suckers! tl;dr landlord flatly told me that my shit wasn't getting fixed because they were too busy turning over apartments for new tenants. so i stood outside their leasing office with a sign that said "so and so is a deadbeat landlord" and turned away all the new tenants that came up. they quickly fixed my shit.i'm not 100% sure of the outcome of my revenge, but just doing it made me feel good inside, and i lol'd at the thought from conception until weeks after i finished. here goes: one day a random guy starts calling/texting me, saying dumb shit that doesn't make sense. i hear laughter in the background. after this happens a few times i start to get annoyed... it's obvious that it's intentional and someone is fucking with me. later that day he starts sending weird pictures, videos... most of which i would have rather not seen, and i've seen some pretty sick shit. this goes on every few hours for two days, sometimes at night. extremely annoying because i don't fuck with anyone, and i definitely don't play phone games... top three pet peeve of mine. fucking cornball. what to do? i don't know the number, so i duckduckgo it and find it's a sprint number, not voip/google. after doing research on reverse # look-ups i decide against it. i'm not about to pay money to find out who's calling me. i also don't want to take the high route and just block the #... i've always been the bigger person, but at this point i'm beyond annoyed and feeling super petty, so fuck that. i think for a while, and decide instead to create a fake backpage ad offering sexual services for dirt cheap prices in biloxi, ms (chose it at random), using this fuck boy's # as the contact. i wait and post it around 12am, in hopes that they'd get several calls from johns until 5 or 6 in the morning asking for "$20 top". the calls/weird messages stopped after that. but i wasn't finished. i continued this shit for a week, posting ads in a different city/state each night to really fuck with him. i would also post ads in this ts section and asked would be johns to send "freak nasty dick pics asap" in the post description. as stated above, not sure if all my hard work went unnoticed, as they probably changed the number after day 1 or 2, and i never tried to call to make sure it was still active. but just the thought of that asshole getting dozens of unsolicited calls/texts for sex for a week straight made it worth it. **edit**: a few people have commented on how this wasn't pro level, and i actually agree with them. i initially tried to post this in /r/pettyrevenge yesterday, but it would not take. that being said, this wasn't a breeze to pull off. it's actually harder than you think to post suspect content on craigslist / backpage. specifically craigslist... that's the site i initially tried, but their bots (or mods) would flag the post for deletion and have it removed within minutes. after trying this a few times, i switched to backpage. also, the circumstances surrounding my revenge are different from most. from what i can see, most submissions to this sub detail face-to-face offenses, like: the guy on floor 4 said a, b, c... my sister-in-law did x, y, z... my boss was a dick... you get it. i didn't have that luxury, only a phone number. in this case, there's not much revenge you can exact outside of petty spam/harassment. i wasn't about to spend weeks / months planning this, but trust when i say i lost my fair share of sleep plotting and carrying this thing out. **edit 2**: i'd also like to make this clear: neither my revenge nor this post is a swipe at ts or prostitutes. people have the right to lead whatever lifestyle they choose. as long as their decisions aren't hurting others, we should respect them. please don't use this post as an excuse to shit on others. **tl;dr**: random guy starts calling/texting, saying stupid things and sending weird photos and videos for two days straight. i make a fake backpage ad offering sexual services and put his # as the contact, asking johns to send "nasty dick pics". the calls stop, but i continue posting ads for a week to really leave my mark. i post several ads in the ts section as well.i took a comparative literature course my sophomore year of college and ended up with this english professor who had a very low opinion of teaching undergrad gen ed courses. we were reading moby dick, one of my favorite books, and in classic nerd style, i spent all quarter working on the paper. i was very happy with how it turned out, but when i got it back, she had given me an f and had just written "see me!" on it. i went to see her and she said "these ideas are too sophisticated for a college sophomore to have come up with. it had to have been plagiarized. i brought in all of my notes, outlines, previous drafts - it was obviously my work. she said - find, but it is still an f paper because it is terrible! she gave me a "chance to redeem my grade" by rewriting it. the paper was typed (this was in the 80s - no computers) so i coped the paper word for word in blue ink and went back to her office hours. she told me she could tell i had "really worked on the paper" and gave the paper a c. then she sent me home to rewrite it again. i recopied the paper word for word, this time in black ink, and brought it back, and she begrudgingly gave me an a. i have her a nice big smile, thanked her for her time, and then went right to the chair of the department with all of the papers. long story short, she was put on probation and had to have the chair sign off on her paper grades to ensure that she was being objective. tldr: english prof gave me 4 different assessments for the same paper - ended up being supervised for failing to grade objectively. so a bajillion years ago i was in a band. one of our bandmembers had a roommate who knew how to do websites, so made a sort of basic framework for me to complete a site for us. i've forgotten how to do most of that little stuff i could do, so bear with me, i don't know all the actual terms. mostly i put up pictures and links and uploaded some mp3's of us playing live. the problem started when i think he deleted what i had uploaded to the server. so now the website looked like shit, it looked like a giant 5 year old attacked it with an eraser. when i asked him about it he said "suck my dick" a few times, and nothing else. mind you, his dad paid for everything for him and no one could tell if he had a job. he spent most of his time that we could tell trying to fuck women he met in internet chat rooms. so i got to work. first, using whatever software thing he gave me, i made another account. i didn't know how to change my password, which he knew, but could make another account entirely. then, i mspainted a solid black image that said "this website is being neglected by (douchenozzle). his screen name is (xdouchenozzlex420_blaze_it_faggots) on every messenger. bother him until he fixes it." then i made that the only thing a visitor would see if they went to the site. next i registered his screen name on a couple dozen music message boards and only made the same post on each one-- "look at this awesome website i made for my band!" about twelve hours later he'd changed the site back to the crappy state he'd left it in and locked out my account... so i signed in with the new one i made and changed it back. it stayed like that for a couple more days before he nuked the whole thing. next time i saw him he freaked out on me. "what the fuck dude i lost like three customers because of that." my reply, of course, was "suck my dick."there is a tl:dr from a member of my college dorm suite when he shared the most difficult thing about his life. moving to a small town right as puberty begins is a hard thing for a boy to go through. it's even worse when you're a korean in a predominantly white neighborhood. "hey kimchi face! are you gonna eat some more of that disgusting shit today?" the bullying broke me. i've cut myself while listening to "adam's song." i even though about doing a columbine with my dad's 38. my attendance for the 1st year of school was so poor, i had to repeat the year. as soon as people found that i would be repeating a year of school, another slew of abuse was coming. then, right there, i tried to hang myself in the garage, over a towel so that my spilled bowels would not hinder my parents when they had to clean me. but by some chance, or some divine intervention (i identify as agnostic,) i survived and was subsequently placed in a psychiatric ward. 7 months, that's what it took to fix me. to convince me that i was not at fault. that i was not inferior in some way to the other children. that i am strong. i returned to school. for the next four years, i endured abuse while achieving the highest academic excellence. i did find solace in the library, where the librarian would introduce me to literature from his own collection. finally, college applications came in. my time to show the fruits of my efforts has begun. i received the acceptance letter to one of america's top 20 universities. word spreads around quickly as usual once i divulged my acceptance letter. the rest of the year goes by smoothly. i spend the summer at community college, taking two courses that would help me graduate earlier. on the first day of summer class, i run into an old bully. though she had a two year academic advantage on me, her advantage is now gone. it's my turn to laugh at her now. as she struggles in this calculus course, i do my best to achieve better than her. i chose to sit behind her, so that she can see the results of my endeavors. through weekly chapter quizzes, and the two midterms before the final i silently remind her that anything she can do, i can do much better. two weeks prior to the final, i'm approached by my defeated tormentor. she starts to cry, blathering how she was sorry for the two years of bullying me. she's bawling how if she fails this calculus course again, her parents will stop supporting her. *aha* my vengeance shall finally be at hand. i pretended to be sympathetic, and told her i was past her bullying. she becomes hopeful, she presses against me and queries if i can tutor her in calculus. *the moment of truth* i beckon her to come closer, i whisper, "fuck off." i didn't bother to check out what happened after the final, but facebook is feeding me delicious tears. she appears to be crashing at her friends' houses. tl:dr be korean. move to small city in america. get bullied based on ethnicity and the ravages of puberty on the male body. almost kill myself. go back to high school two years later. get accepted to a top 20 university in america. go to summer school. meet old bitch. drink delicious tears as she wallows in self-pity and he doesn't bother to help her.when i worked in boston, i used to take the commuter rail in. there was a small lot, that was not an mbta lot, which abutted the "pay $2 per day" lot that the mbta ran. for 5 years, i parked in this small lot with several other regulars, including the mbta conductors who all wanted to save $500-$600 per year. one day i pull in to the lot and discover that there is a padlock on the gate which has been chained shut. i see dave, our regular conductor for the 7:25am just clicking the lock home and roll down my window and ask him: "hey dave, what gives?" "new policy, only mbta employees can park here now" (the lot was small, and when we "regulars" parked there, some of the conductors and other sundry trainpeople had to pay.) i grumble and dig for change, which is composed of nickels and dimes left over from fast food purchases (quarters were for tolls). on the way home, i stop at a cvs in boston and pick up my own padlock. i get to the lot, and instead of rushing with the rest of the cattle to our cars, i confidently walk over to the gate of the little free lot, and place my lock, to which only i have the keys, on the chain. the conductors don't get to their cars until after the turn-around and cursory clean up happens (i live at the end of the line). the next morning i see that the gate is wide open, my lock has been bolt cut and is laying on the ground under a no longer used chain. i park, conductor dave is getting out of his car, we exchange "the nod" and i walk with him to the platform. other "regulars" are pulling in and getting out of their cars now along with the other mbta folks that are there in time to snag a free spot. "so what happened to the new policy" i innocently ask dave. "too much trouble." he says. "besides, i think the laundromat actually owns the land and they got pissed and locked us in last night. had to go find bolt cutters to get out." do tell dave, do tell. for the next 2 years that i worked in boston, nary a problem. total savings? ~$3500.00. screwing the mbta? priceless. edit: since it seems to be a point of contention, the lot is an open, dirt lot that it turns out actually was owned by the laundromat next door who didn't care who parked there. the new "policy" was one that was implemented by the mbta employees informally... and not one which was official. this was *not* an employee lot and was as fair game to me and the other people who knew this as well as the mbta folks. hope that clears things up.ok, this goes wayy back, when me and my friends were around 18 or so. we were quite a rowdy bunch. not explicitly mean, but we were generally lacking in the respect department. we were visiting a festival, and were camping just at the end of the camp area, close to a forest. now, when we get back from a night of partying, and wake up the next day, we notice that lots of our suff has been stolen. cell phones, knifes, axes, clothes, anything that looked remotely valuable. they probably did it during night, so they got what they could out of our tents in the dark. that shit was not going to fly, oh no! we promptly postponed our hangovers and went on a hate-driven inspector cluseau-esque rampage, questioning everyone we thought even remotely suspicious. as the camping was huge, this went on for most of the day, giving us nothing but new frienemies. we then hypothesised, as we were close to the forest, that someone from outside had raided our tents. we promptly went on to search the forest, and found several campers trying their best to get a free festival. we checked their tents as best we could without damaging anything. after an hour or so of this, suddenly, in a 3-man tent with the tenants out, we spotted my friend’s axe though the fabric of the padlocked tent. after that, it went haywire. we tore their tent apart, arguably with thin evidence, but then we found lots of our stolen stuff. cell phones, clothes, yeah, this was definitely them. we proceeded to trash everything they had with them. all the clothes, sleeping bags. afterwards, we threw the remains up in the surrounding trees. we found their keys, tickets off the island where the festival was held, and a cell phone, which we of course trashed, as such was the general atmosphere. when in rome. some astma medicine was found. we decide not to trash that, not out of the good of our heart, but because we thought it more constructive to leave it whole. pissed on. well, after looking around, all their stuff torn to shreds and thrown all over the small grove, the steam went out of us. their former camp looked like godzilla had visited. this was all fine and dandy, but we felt something was lacking. we wanted some personal time with the people living there. they were a guy and a girl, judging from the former clothes. so we settled down. made ourselves comfortable, fetched our sleeping bags. we even ordered pizzas. and we waited... now, granted, we were not very discrete. we questioned everyone moving through the forest to their tents, and were generally having a blast. this led to our downfall. a friend that was happening to watch the path into forest called me: “get the hell out, cops are coming!”. i was alone at the trashed camp at the time. i promptly gathered up or stuff and went around the corner of some bushes. where i met two police officers riding the biggest horses i have ever seen. i just walked straight to and by them, the horses just becoming bigger and bigger as the laws of geometrical perspective set in. i still don’t really know why they did not stop me, i was probably looking guilty as fuck, leaving that h-bombed camp. anyhow, we never got that face time with the burglars. we decided to give it a rest, as the police now was involved and we had happened to do some things they might take offence at. but we still and their keys, and tickets to the main land. we refunded two of our own tickets, and used theirs instead, as this way, it became less traceable. while on the 3 hour boat ride back to mainland, we went aft, and threw the keys in the sea. it felt good, as their tickets had partially funded the gift of keys to the sea god. tldr: someone broke into our tents and stole most of value during a festival. we found their camp and most of our gear, trashed the rest except the asthma medicine which we pissed diligently on, used their tickets back to main land and threw their keys in the sea.link to part 2 of my story: i must have deleted the original post. oh well. some of the commenters warned me that i don't get too in deep with this little past time of mine. but i can not just rationalize the bad guy (gal) getting away with it, and for how easy i am accomplishing this 'revenge', this took about 15 minutes of my day. so after she went cold for a few months i assumed all was well, the new dude she married found out her con via my anonymous facebook message and she split after he confronted her - off and out of my reach forever, fine by me. turns out she ended up coming back to him, along with a new facebook account, new last name, even an off the books job working for her husbands side business making arts and crafts, cute. i came across this on social media because it seems her whole family is now aware of this relationship and are in full support of their union. i wouldn't mind that except for the fact that her family didn't give two shits about her when she was locked up. the burden was on me to comfort her through visits and phone calls and money...and most of all my time. now if the burden never actually was on me and her family was helping her without my knowledge, she was thus manipulating me and hid the truth of their involvement. i feel more revenge is totally appropriate again. on the other hand, if her family wasn't helping her ever, and it actually was just me alone...well that would kinda irk me now that they are suddenly all loving and supportive because she has her life back on track. with of course a new husband providing everything to her since she cannot provide for herself (still a fugitive and still flat broke). where were they when i dealt with her incarceration? and why are they enjoying the fruits of her new savior's labor knowing full and well she is doing the exact same thing she attempted to do to me and her other ex-husband(s). no, they can't have their daughter back like none of her exploits or past decisions ever happened, and they especially can't have her back with me knowing they did nothing to help her ever. so i paid $3.99 to find out her husband's address online, match pictures i found on a real estate website to his pictures on facebook, verified it was his. emailed the address to u.s. marshalls, who contacted her offending state, who put me in contact with a parole recovery agent, who then contacted local police in her new state, who showed up at his apartment and took her to jail. last time she got 6 months for violating parole (instagram pics drinking and she was escorting on the side), this time for straight up fleeing. who knows if they will give her more this time considering she bailed after barely a month once they released her for parole the second time. you could argue this is unjustified revenge, i've gone too far, leave her alone now, etc. maybe i made up new justifications regarding her family and annoyed her husband didn't heed my warning so i had to do this again. then again, my second attempt at revenge flopped so this is my redo. one thing is for sure, she's still a criminal that hasn't once fulfilled her end of the bargain in the courts. i assume she doesn't know someone is actually following her whereabouts considering how dumb she would be to broadcast her location on the internet...or maybe she's fully aware of her spell she has on her husband and it's only a matter of time before she goes back to prison. she knows he'll stay by her side, because she's played that game once before... so here's my story, down, up, or side vote, doesn't matter to me, i didn't want to leave this story unfinished. i'll probably keep tabs on her if she returns to fugitive status again. if not, best of luck to her. edit: here's the origin post (part 1) if you care to start from the beginning: this story is a bit out of character for this forum, but i think you'll enjoy it. [yevgeniy dolmatovsky]( was a fairly well known russian/soviet poet and author. during ww2 he was a front line war correspondent. since this was the ussr, there was no independent press, and he was a full red army officer. during barbarossa he was captured, along with 100,000 other soviet soldiers and officers, in the [uman pocket]( the officers were separated from the regular soldiers and led into a school. they were made to sit behind desks. [alexander edler von daniels]( a german general, came in to the room and delivered a long lecture to the captured soviet officers that the soviet union is conquered, on the superiority of the reich, and the futility of resistance. the soviet officers were then sent to concentration camps. the fact that dolmatovsky was a jew escaped the nazis, and he was sent to a military camp. he managed to escape and somehow rejoin the russian army. several years passed, and dolmatovsky found himself at the battle of stalingrad. during operation uranus, the soviets encircled the german 6th army, which forced its surrender. much of the 6th army command, including fieldmarshal frederich paulus surrendered as well. dolmatovsky found out that von daniels was among the captured generals. he asked one of the soviet commanders (rokassovskiy) to arrange a meeting. when the request was granted, he put on a little play... von daniels was marched into a schoolhouse and made to sit behind a desk. dolmatovsky walked in and asked von daniels if he recognized him. von daniels didn't. he then reminded him of the uman pocket, the schoolhouse there, the little classroom packed with soviet officers, and the little lecture on the superiority of the reich... the story starts here: [the advent of the bitch queen]( now, in addition to all the shit mentioned in the link above, there was one thing the bq did to me that i still can't quite believe it happened because it was so petty and mean. as i said in that post, my health was (and is) fucking awful, and the company got some pretty nice bonuses from the government as part of a program to try help people with disabilities get regular work. (yes, my health is *that* bad.) at one point i managed to catch a cold that very quickly turned into a severe lung infection. i was in the hospital for almost two weeks. every day i and/or my family and my government contact called the office to keep them up to date on what was happening and when they could expect me to return to work. bq never answered the phones, so about half the time my other coworkers took messages, and the other half of the time we left messages on the answering machine. bq never returned a single call. we sent emails. still nothing. none of us heard a thing from her the entire time i was sick. when i returned to work, several days before the doctor had recommended i go back, she told me she was going to take me to the board to have me fired for missing so much time without telling her. naturally i was *ropable*, but thankfully my other coworkers backed me up and the phone messages and emails were enough to prove my point, and i got to keep the job until the end of my contract. fast forward two years to this morning. i knew bq had lost her job with the company not long after i left, but i heard no more about it and gave no shits. i'd gotten my revenge, such as it was. petty, yes, but like the pettyrevenge thread said, i takes it where i can gets it. this morning i got a call from a big local hotel. bq put me on her resume as a reference. i don't know how fucking desperate she was to put me on there, but when the universe hands me vengeance on a silver platter, i fucking take it! i told them everything. every poor decision, every lie, every rule broken, every attempt to screw the people around her, every single little unprofessional and dishonest thing i could think of. and then i gave them the number of the company if they wanted more information. i know that the industry here is utterly incestuous, and this information will be at every decent hotel and motel in the city within the day, and probably all over the state within a week. she called me a couple hours later demanding to know why i gave her a bad reference. "don't use someone you tried to fuck over as a reference, bitch."okay, so this was a few years ago when i was in college. i studied languages and it was required of me to spend an entire school year abroad either studying or working to get a feel for the language. i decided to pick somewhere rural where nobody would speak english, wanting to immerse myself fully, and ended up being a farmhand in a tiny european village. i lived in a little apartment next to the farmhouse and was supposed to live like part of the family - emphasis on *supposed* to. don't get me wrong, the place was beautiful, the work was interesing (and a great workout) and my boss was a decent guy. it would have been pretty fun were it not for my boss's wife. hoo boy... where do we even begin with this ball of bitterness? bit of background: my boss's wife -- let's call her witch -- was a city girl, one of those high-flying businesswomen who got to travel and work with foreign branches, manage major projects etc. she was all high heels and designer bags and fancy brunches with her coworkers... and then she married a farmer and moved to the arse-end of her country to be a housewife. by the time i came to work on the farm witch had two small children and had turned into the sourest, most unpleasant woman i had ever met. i learned later that she treated a lot of employees, especially women, the way she treated me, but they were able to leave. i wasn't. witch treated me like dirt. i was pretty much treated like a servant, made to clean her house and look after her children on top of long work days on the farm (she hated farm work and did nothing at all to help - this'll be important later). she'd scream and swear at me and call me every name she could think of whenever her husband wasn't around to hear her, and sneer in silence when he was. i was terrified of her and there wasn't much i could do to fight back. not only did she control my room and board but also my pay, food supplies and the chance of a good review at the end of the school year. i needed good references from my employer for my uni to accept me on the final year course, and that witch knew it. every time i'd try to talk to her husband or another farm hand she'd blame it on 'cultural differences' and then step up her game when they weren't around. i remember one week where her husband was away when i got sick with food poisoning and for the entire week she left me in my apartment alone, to the point where i ran out of food. honestly, you'd expect her to drag out the magic mirror and ask it who's the fairest of them all with the way she behaved. so this hell goes on for a full nine months and there's next to nothing i can do about it. i just figured i'd tough it out and go home, then i'd never need to see her again... but then witch's husband went away again, and i got my chance for revenge. it was literally my final day on the farm, the afternoon before i flew back home. i had to pack and clean up my apartment, but she'd ordered me away from all that to fix a window in one of our guest houses - she liked setting petty chores to overload me, then scream at me when it was impossible to finish them all. so i'm hanging out the window two floors up when witch comes stomping down the path in her high heels and some fancy jacket and starts yelling up at me in her language. she says that i'm to go to the goat shed right away because one of the goats is giving birth, and her husband isn't there to help. now, we'd lost two of the goats that winter so it was important that someone did it. we couldn't afford to lose another goat - or rather, *they* couldn't afford to. and that's where the revenge came in: before he'd left, my boss had given me my final pay and written and signed a reccomendation for my college course. i could answer any way i wanted and she couldn't do a damn thing. no leverage left to hold over me. so i smiled, all nice and polite, and yelled back down that i couldn't possibly come and help. i still had so much to do and she'd *told* me that this window needed fixing. what if i left it unfinished and someone got hurt? what if i couldn't clean my apartment in time? after all, she'd *told* me to make it spotless for her before i left. "i'm so sorry witch, but it's just not possible." i could already see her starting to panic, and she started trying to argue about other people who could take my place doing these jobs. her father-in-law (sixty years old with a back problem), her own mother (untrained; taking care of her kids for her), even the cleaning lady that came in once a week (lol what?). i had legit reasons for all of them, until finally i said: "but can't you do it, witch? you've been living here for years, i bet you've done this loads of times! you'll get it done no problem." check-fucking-mate. she couldn't back down from that and the alternative was not doing it and risking another dead goat and a pissed off husband. she didn't have any leverage left over me and it's not like she could drag me out of a second floor window, so off she went, the designated goat midwife. it was twins. she was there for three hours. the last image i have of witch before i left for good is of her standing in the goat pen surrounded by the neighbour's kids and a couple of tourists. she was still in her high heels and nice clothes holding this slimy, squirming baby goat out as far out in front of her as she could get it, covered in blood and placental fluid and this thick yellow mucus. the look of disgust and horror on her face still gives me the warm fuzzies. karma's a bitch, lady. tldr: boss's wife makes my life a misery while working abroad. rules-lawyered my way into getting little miss fashionista covered in blood and placental fluid. my father was a commercial fisherman before i was born. he traveled the world (originally from canada) and worked away for months at a time. as an aside, one time while fishing a soviet sub surfaced behind them and it was one of the most frightening experiences of a lifetime for a fearless man. anyway, the boat and its crew were fishing off the coast of africa and every time they went out to their spot, and were about to drop the nets...the engine would conk out.....after the second time they hid a crew member in the engine room and found out the second in command was sabotaging the engine. (from what i remember the time for fishing was short and there was a pretty heavy level of competition and a lot at stake. the saboteur was being paid by a rival fishing vessel so they could get the advantage) so, this may not sound like it...but it was a pretty big deal. these people had a short amount of time to make a lot of money and the whole crew was away from their families for long stretches. so, what to do with this traitor? their was talk of throwing him overboard but no one wanted to be brought up on charges of murder. beating him was not really a punishment. so they came up with this... ...they took his id, took all his money, stripped him naked, and left him on a beach in africa. (update) so, some people are asking for a follow up. this is my first post so please be kind. i am still learning. well, my dad is passed away now so i only have the details that he told me a long time ago. the aftermath is up in the air. i am pretty sure the saboteur was from canada or the us. i don't know how he could have made it back without any id or anything. that being said, the world has a way of looking after you, so some people probably gave him some clothes and then he probably could have made it to a consulate and maybe got a bunch of people to verify who he was via phone....but i am just speculating. my dad said no one from the fishing crew ever heard from him again....but i doubt they would be in touch anyway...so that doesn't really mean anything. as for the soviet sub. the time frame for all of this was probably late 60's, early 70's. the sub just came up fairly close right behind them....then observed the ship for about 5 minutes....then submerged again. to some it may not sound that scary but my father said it was unreal and he was genuinely freaked out. they had no idea the subs intentions. they were scared for about 20 minutes after when they guessed that if something was going to happen...it would have happened. off topic but he did work for a mcdonalds supplier at one point and they fished for the fish that they used for filet o' fish and he said never, never, never, eat a filet o' fish. :) that is all i know. per request from here. this happened to my best friend. his wife was japanese and living in america with him on a spousal visa. long story short; she was banging some guy who was always an asshole to us. (we know why now) she made the mistake of telling her best friend who lives in japan whom is also my good friend. (i live in japan) the friend was recently cheated on and still very upset. she told me. my best friend was in the middle of finals. (went back to school after getting laid off to get a more specialized degree) i sat on this information for two weeks and then told him. he took it pretty well as it filled in a lot of holes for him. then i said so many guys when hurt are too nice. i convinced him to ruin this bitch. we figured out her facebook password. (why do most women pick the most obvious of passwords?) sure enough there were picture, conversations, and what's this?!? the boyfriend's parents. glorious!!!! it turns out they are super christian. my friend contacted the boyfriend's mother and very politely explained who he was and what went on. she was very sorry and she promised my friend that his wife would no longer be welcome in their home. step 1 complete! step 2 was going to take more skill. my friends wife was pretty butt hurt about him ruining her relationship. she said she will just tell her parents that my friend beat her. they don't speak english, so there was nothing my friend could do. i told my friend to write the letter which he did and again explained it very politely. per my advice my friend also included the dated photos of them together. my mutual japanese friend translated the letter into natural japanese. my friend's wife had no idea of his plan. she was also planning to go home for a month to visit. my friend timed the mailing of the letter so it arrived one day before she left. she received a phone call from her father and he totally sided with my friend. his wife called up crying and called him an asshole. now if you think this burn couldn't get any better, you are wrong. his wife was looking for her dream job at an industrial design company. she had an interview lined up for when she got back. they were ready to hire her, but when talk about her visa status came up, she explained that she will be getting divorced and will lose her status. the company explained that they couldn't hire her because they don't have it in the budget to sponsor a visa. bam! mission complete. :) she's now back in japan. i guess she works at a japanese company now, but that isn't her dream. tl; dr sometimes cheating bitches get what they deserve. i typed this on my phone, so sorry if there are typos. edit: there seems to be a lot of butthurt cheaters still replying to this post. lol!i don't know what jebbie's real name was, but that was his nickname. i'd known the kid since kindergarten and never was there a sweeter person. he was a kitten, just a cool guy. he'd give you his lunch if you didn't have any. he'd hug you if you'd had a rough day, even if you were a guy. jebbie was a bonafide genius. top of all of his classes, but kinda slow socially. he liked people, but the kindness made people treat him worse and worse the older he got. we were in various schools together, up through high school, which is where i lost track of him. i was a crap student. smart, but didn't care about the work. we'd gone into one of the most crime ridden, shitty school systems north carolina had to offer and i'd been suspended a half dozen times for various things. nothing violent or destructive. mostly just 'insubordination' or skipping classes. i didn't care about school. i was past that. life sucked too hard to care. jebbie, sadly, was target of every bully in that school. it got really bad sophomore year, when we were in algebra. this algebra class was taught by a teacher who might once have had a soul, but it'd been sucked out by years of high school. she cared less than i did. this little fuck (we'll call him hunter), who was maybe 140 lbs soaking wet took to abusing jebbie. hunter was latino (which was more of a subculture in our school, less of a racial divide) and a loud mouth little thug. mean bastard. just cruel. he'd poke jebbie, toss things at him, kick him after class, call him a faggot constantly, steal his books and food. shit like that. jebbie took it all and he'd try to go to the teachers, but the teachers didn't give a shit. like i said, bad school. it came to a head when hunter tripped jebbie and made him split his head on a desk. hunter got a week suspension, claiming it was an accident. jebbie got six stitches and transferred to another class. when he got back, his favorite target was gone. hunter decided i was going to be the new one. i, by then, had little to lose. i was failing every class except theater and english. i was considered a 'trouble maker' by every school admin and was on a first name basis with the school 'resource officer'. first day he's back, hunter looks around, spots me reading quietly in the corner, and tosses spitballs at me. childish shit, but i'd seen just how much good going to the teachers did jebbie. i immediately got up from my desk, circled the outside of the room, and squared up on hunter. he got up, but i outweighed him by a good forty pounds. i knew how it was going to play out, though. i went for his head, getting him in a half nelson. i held it for about five seconds, then stepped back. he threw a few shitty haymakers, tapping me on the chin and cheeks. it was like being punched by a fly in trainers. the teacher was shouting, but i let him deck me five or six times, then shoved him away. he fell over several desks and i retreated to the door, stepping outside. ten minutes later, the school resource cop shows up and i tell him hunter attacked me. i say i was just going to sharpen my pencil and he stepped up, and pushed me. nobody, and i mean nobody...asked the other students what happened and the teacher hadn't seen the start of it. hunter, of course, denied it but in doing so he pushed the school resource cop who was telling him to sit back down. now, hunter is in handcuffs. they search him. he had three joints, a pocket knife, and a pack of cigarettes. hunter was expelled immediately and charged with assault on a police officer, possession on school property, and carrying a concealed weapon (class 1 misdemeanor in carolina). since it was his third hit for drugs, that went up to a felony. i got two days suspension to add to my long, long list, but frankly? fucking worth it. jebbie, wherever you are, i wish you all the best. you deserved better. **update** alright, i said i'd hunt around and try to find jebbie. my mom, as it turned out, had my old yearbook from highschool for my freshman year and i remembered he was really into theater. i found his name and picture in the credits for the school play that year. a bit of google-fu later and i found out he got married (the announcement was still on the web) and moved to california. he owns a little computer repair place and has a kid. he designs those robotic battle bot things. fucking coolest stuff i've ever seen. i don't know if i have the guts to call him. no way he'd remember me. i'm just glad he's alright. this is not mine! i just read it and thought you would all love it. *(take this entire story here with a bit of a raised eyebrow, since it was told to me by a bunch of drunk old men telling me seventy-year-old stories that have probably been embellished to hell and back, but i cannot deny that the stories are entertaining as hell when you have a belly full of filipino malt liquor and goat cooked in coconut milk and chili peppers.)* okay, so i just got back from visiting family out in the boondocks (the flat kind) over the long holiday weekend. i *rarely* go and visit family since we are so dysfunctional, it's not even funny, but this time decided i needed to get out of manila for a couple of days. while i was there, some 'uncles' and i got to sitting around with some beer, churning up stories about my mother's father that i had never heard of. my grandfather was the younger son and the second child in a family with five siblings. his *kuya* (older brother) was already a lawyer when the second world war broke out and the japanese invaded the philippines. grandpa was a young (15 at the time) farmer who helped his dad pay for basic necessities while his brother paid for the education of his three younger sisters. the family wasn't poor, but they weren't sipping champagne either. think "lower middle-class". on christmas day, 1941, grandpa's older brother shows up at the family house with a bag and a steamer trunk. the bag is filled with paper money and silver coins, and the trunk's got some guns in it. he had liquidated all his assets and purchased the guns where he could find them, getting out of manila while he still could, realizing the japanese were going to occupy the city. life went on relatively unchanged for the next couple of months, but the news was always grim. the japanese occupied manila, then swept through the flat plains of central luzon, including my grandpa's town. the american forces, caught in a pincer movement, eventually retreated to bataan and corregidor, and anyone even vaguely familiar with the pacific war during ww2 knows how that ended. (side note: my uncles said that according to my grandpa and other oldsters, the occupying japanese *officers* were unfailingly polite and very, very scrupulous when interacting with filipinos. the lower ranking soldiers, however, were a complete one-eighty. my uncles insist that they were korean (probably conscripted) and that any atrocities (ie, random beatings, rape, etc.) that would happen would be at their hands. i'm guessing that the officers would endorse their men and their actions after the fact because to do otherwise would make them seem weak.) anyway, my grandpa and his brother begin resisting the japanese. it was mostly information passed from one village or town to another, but during the bataan death march, they also sheltered at least one american soldier who fled east after escaping to put some distance between themselves and the japanese. (i took this with a grain of salt; every single family within a hundred miles that survived ww2 has at least one story of sheltering a death march soldier.) it came to a head in late 1942, when another resistance group from a nearby village stole a truck with a load of gasoline or ammunition (my uncles couldn't agree). the japanese went house to house looking for the perps, and they caught my grandpa's brother in a well, trying to hide some weapons. after they pulled him up and they found the guns, my grand-uncle was summarily executed by bayoneting. my grandpa was very close to his *kuya*. after a period of grief, he went full on malevolent on the japanese, including: * colluding with his neighbors to make rice/fruit/sugarcane wine and selling it cheap to the occupying garrison (it wasn't large, maybe 15-20 men total), preying on their already poor discipline and reducing them to drunkards. they got so bad, they were replaced by another unit. grandpa introduced the new boys to the joys of drink, too. rinse and repeat. japanese officers yelling at their troops became a common sight. * capturing rats and field mice and releasing them into the warehouses in the surrounding areas that the japanese commandeered to store their (stolen) rice. aside from eating the stored rice, the rats shit everywhere. this pissed off the japanese to no end; *everybody* knows never to fuck with an asian's rice. * collecting shit from pretty much every single human who was willing to poo in a bucket for him, mixing it with water to thin it down, then "fertilizing" the trees around the japanese hq and barracks. it would dry out fairly quickly in the heat so there was only a vague shit-smell, but when it rained . . . it turned into a fetid sludge that clung to everything, especially the garrisoned troops and their vehicles. apparently, a couple of those trees are still around, and they are huge and bear delicious, delicious mangoes every year. * putting any and all handy chemicals into every single liquid the japanese were storing. water, oil, gasoline . . . you name it. when he could get away with it, he poured in everything from salt to soap to ammonia (aka rancid piss). * stealing japanese supplies be it arms, ammunition, medication, or whatever, burying it, then turning right around and snitching on himself: he would tell the japanese officers that he had "heard" of a "stockpile" buried by a "resistance group" then go on and point out the cache he had buried a week or month or two earlier. he fucked with those too: when possible, some, but not all, of the supplies were tampered with to look perfectly normal, yet malfunction when used. the japanese officers thought he was loyal to the empire and he got preferential treatment, allowing him and his neighbors to cook up even more shenanigans. * when the americans finally invaded, my grandpa (at the ripe old age of 18) and the resistance group he was with went on the offensive, scouting out the path ahead of the americans and killing isolated japanese when they could. according to my uncles, my granpda never talked about this, except to say that it was how he met his wife. after the war, grandpa did what he knew best: he kept farming. he was, however, smart enough to buy a couple of neighboring farms whose families had been killed by the japanese. with nearly four times the arable land area from before the war, he was able to continue his brother's work and put his sisters through school. and that, i think, was the cherry on top of his revenge sundae. my grandpa died fairly young (50s), and after hearing these stories, i regret that i didn't get to know my grandpa when i myself was a man. preferably over beer.not my story. my mom is a pharmacist and she constantly deals with addicts trying to get their fix. this is a big, busy pharmacy in brooklyn doing hundreds of prescriptions every day, so you get all sorts. the pharmacist is bound by a ton of laws and procedures. this latest story started a week ago and just wrapped up last night. a lady came in with a rx for oxycodone. that's a pretty heavy drug that's on the controlled list and is pretty badly abused. the corporate policy is that if the pharmacist has any suspicion that they inform the customer that the drug is out of stock and they will order it and it will come in a couple of days. that's exactly what happened, and the woman flipped the fuck out. she screamed at my mom, threw shit in the pharmacy, and was escorted out by security. after, she called corporate to complain how horrible my mom was and tried to get her fired. after this treatment, my mom was pretty pissed off. there's a database that pharmacists can access to look up certain controlled drugs that are prescribed to a particular customer. this database showed that this woman was getting the same prescription for oxycodone from multiple doctors and trying to fill different prescriptions in different pharmacies. because this lady didn't behave, my mom went above and beyond and contacted all the prescribing doctors to let them know that this lady was triple-dipping. they all flipped out because what she did was very illegal and all dropped her as a patient. all the other pharmacies that were filling her prescriptions blocked her as well. if my mom was in a really bad mood, she could've contacted dea, but she decided not to. however, we're pretty certain that the doctors are obligated to do so. if you're breaking the law, don't be an asshole to people who can catch you. this happened nearly ten years ago when i was a stupid college student. i went to school in a state which has very liberal policies regarding medicinal marijuana, the chief requirements are that you are a resident of the state and that you pay a small fee to a doctor in order to obtain your medical card for whatever ailment you like. my two best friends (who were also my dorm roommates) and i availed ourselves this opportunity, since it would allow us to have a fair amount of pot without legal penalty (university policy wasn't as open minded, but we didn't care). since we were able to have a rather large quantity, we occasionally helped the other residents in our dorm acquire what they wanted so they could avoid some of the unsavory characters attracted to this particular business. one of the residents was dipshit (ds) and he often came by our room with his bosom buddy, lil twitchy (lt). everyone who came by was treated as a friend and trusted to respect the community spirit of the residence hall. one day after classes, a friend and i returned to my room to partake, and i discovered that the glass storage jar wasn't in it's usual place. thinking one of my roommates had maybe borrowed it, i called them both. neither had, and at this point we began to worry. i'm going to take this opportunity to introduce my roommates, so bear with me. first we have the grizzly, a 220 lbs, 6'6" alaskan native: bearded, mohawked, with a liberal application of facial piercings. next, we have thunder lord: 185 lbs of pure, angry muscle with a keen interest in rugby, boxing, and tattoos. finally, there's me. i'm no chisled, bronze warrior god, but i'm fairly smart and i can hold my own in a tight spot. as i sit in my room, waiting for my friends to return, i'm fiddling with my phone trying to think of someone, anyone who might have a rational explanation for where our weed has gone. then i notice a missed call from an unknown number placed the previous night around 3 a.m. when thunder and grizzly return, i call this number, and ds answers. i ask him why he called, and he says "oh, lt and i were hanging out last night and we wanted a little smoke, i was calling to see if you guys were still awake. when you didn't pick up, i got some from tommy. i hope i didn't wake you". i reassure him that he didn't and get off the phone. i relay the conversation to my (now furious) mates and we agree that something seems fishy. we can't reach tommy, so we walk down the hall and visit ds's long suffering roommate who informs us that ds and lt were making liberal use of the colombian marching powder last night, and were awake until all hours. we decide to pay a visit to lt, who is, as his name suggests, a twitchy little bastard. as we walk up the lawn of his dorm, who should we see but dipshit himself, head down, trying very hard not to be noticed. we approach and surround the poor bastard, and it is immediately obvious he is very stoned. "ds, we seem to be missing some of our stash, and we've heard you were wide awake last night. any chance you might know where our jar walked off to?" i ask. he stammers "no, man, no way. i told you, tommy hooked me up last night". "alright, ds, that's fine, that's fine. but given the situation, we would like to verify that. can we see your phone, just to make sure tommy's number is in your call log around 3 am?" at this point ds is sweating bullets, but he says "sorry, i left my phone in lts room, and i really gotta get to class". on a hunch, i slip away from him while thunder and grizzly continue to grill him, and pull my phone out. i redial the unknown number and seconds later, ds's pants begin to play music. "ds, if you've left your phone behind, what's ringing in your pocket? why are you lying to us? why don't you just come clean now and save us all a bunch of trouble?" and thus, the floodgates open. the tears and confession pour forth, and ds tells that what remains of our stash is up in lt's dorm room. we escort him there and he knocks on the door. when lt opens the door, a wave of smoke billows out and he has a huge, stoned smile as he greets ds. when he sees us flanking his buddy, that smile melts like a popsicle in hell. we shove ds into the room, and grizz locks the door behind us. a beating of biblical proportions is about to commence, and that's bad. bad for the thieves and bad for us. thinking fast, i say "alright, you stupid fucks, here's the deal. you broke into our room and stole from us while we slept. ballsy, but stupid. so, i'm going to weigh what remains of my stash and you two morons are going to pay for what you smoked. three times over; once for grizz, once for thunder, and once for me. it's going to be a lot money, so you have a month to get it all together. in the meanwhile, we are going to take this laptop, this longboard, and that xbox as collateral. you'll get it all back when you pay up. you don't pay, you don't get it back. good?" the idiots look relieved, and thunder and grizzly seem pleased, so we collect the collateral and what remains of our stash, and return triumphantly home. the next day, i awaken around 1pm with a scorching (but victorious) hangover because someone very very shrill is screaming at the top her lungs just outside the dorm building. i walk downstairs to investigate and to my amazement, a middle aged woman is rabidly berating ds just outside the dorm. i eavesdrop with no small glee and hear "you stupid, stupid little shit! your father and i have given you everything, everything and this how you repay us? $12,000 in credit card bills and bank over draft fees? what the actual fuck have you been doing here? you've been at college 2 months, and you haven't gone to class once? this is finished, right here, right now. i drove here alone, but you're getting in the car with me and we are leaving!" apparently ds had burnt though his folks money and landed himself on academic suspension. it seems his folks got the bills and a call from the registrars office on same day, and his mom decided her little boy still had some growing up to do. she was true to her word, threw him in the car and that was the last we ever saw of ds. all his belongings were left behind, so we split the goods with his roommate and made out like bandits. lt lasted a month or so more before apparently deciding that a liberal arts education wasn't for him, and dropping out. before leaving, he paid us in full, and we returned his things. tl;dr step 1: track down stolen pot. step 2: outsmart moronic thieves and restrain murderous roommates. step 3: moronic thieves dig their own metaphorical graves. step 4: profit wildly.just discovered this subreddit today, i thought i'd share my story. from kindergarten to 5th grade i went to an all girls catholic school. i never met any boys before who weren't blood related so when i transferred to regular public school in 6th grade i was culture shocked. all the boys were so... pervy. they were flipping girls skirts and making rude comments. i was the new girl &amp; the new target of the alpha bully, let's call him tommy. in 6th grade i was a small girl &amp; tommy was around 9 inches taller than me and he was big, like fat kid w/ some muscle big. i couldn't stand his perverted comments! he said things like i should come suck his dick and things like that. the other girls said "you get used to it" but i just couldn't believe my little catholic ears! we had this group project where he and i were grouped together, i was assigned to bring materials and he said "don't forget to bring lube and condoms!" and everyone in class laughed, i felt so embarrassed. (i know this doesn't sound like a big deal but to 12 year old me, it was) i couldn't take it anymore. i don't know what came over me, i took apart one of my spiral notebooks, walked up to tommy &amp; his friends and slashed tommy's face with the wire from my notebook. he fell to the ground, he was on his knees &amp; hands. i elbow his spine (i think this is a wrestling move, i don't know the name), he's on his stomach with a bloody face. i was about to kick him in the face but he was crying already so i came to my senses and walked away. the slash left a scar on his forehead &amp; he never made an obscene comment towards any of the girls again. edit: i'm 21 now &amp; i saw him on the train once, scar still there. we nodded at each other &amp; i guess all is forgiven edit 2: i don't understand why when a man posts a prorevenge about ass kicking, he gets a "you're awesome bro!" but when a little girl does it it's like "you're a terrible person" ... this bully was sexually harassing all the girls in my grade! do you guys have any idea what it's like to be a young girl &amp; being told you're gonna get fucked in the ass later tonight?? no you don't (well maybe some do) i guess i just flipped out because i was sexually touched by my tennis coach in 2nd grade.. but that's another story. sorry for pissing everyone off with my post edit 3: after remembering this story i looked up tommy on facebook &amp; he's a teacher now!!! woah!!! lol! edit 4: i didn't mention it before since i didn't think this post would get a lot of attention but i should mention it now to justify my actions. he wasn't just sexually harassing me &amp; girls with his words but he liked groping us too. slapping our butts, grabbing our boobs, barging into the girls restroom, etc. (there was even one instance he jerked off in the girls bathroom) and it reinforced other boys to do these things as well. all the girls didn't want to stand up to him so i felt like i had to do it to get him to stop. so yeah, if i went to juvenile hall back then i wouldn't even plead not guilty or deny it. but he deserves juvi time too. edit 5: oh my god my first reddit gold!!! :'d thank you so much!! i'll treasure this moment forever! as a naturally thin woman i have had my share of being called everything under the sun from string bean to tampon string. most of it doesn't phase me but every once in awhile if you catch me in the wrong mood i might go off on someone for harshing my mellow. this particular day i had walked into a local watering hole with a swimming pool on premise and i wore what i considered to be proper attire for this venue. shorts and a tee with a bathing suit underneath. just so we are clear on the subject, most women on any given day requiring the use of a bathing suit are already battling body conscious demons without the aid of perfect strangers beligerently hurling unsolicited advice. as it happens sometimes the day's events are going to have their own agenda. i just wanted to meet some friends and blow off steam that day. as i walked by a man whose body type resembles a beached whale i can hear him snickering with his cronies, pointing at me and exclaiming things like, "that chick needs to eat a cheeseburger." i started to stop dead in my tracks and do an about face but i changelled my inner lloyd christmas from dumb &amp; dumber and instead calmly proceeded to the bartender. i smiled, and gave her my order. a drink, a shot, and a cheeseburger later, i'm feeling pretty satisfied, appetite and liquid-courage-wise. i then turned over to the sea cow that had been calling me names and i gave him a polite wave. a bucket of beers later i'm pretty sure he is now second guessing that perhaps we have met somewhere and surely thinks i am flirting. i smile sweetly at the bartender and i hand her a generous tip for what would have been my entire check, when that "portly gentleman right over there offered to pick up my tab," and i smile and wave again just as le douche is motioning for me to come over and the bartender catches a glimpse of a hand gesture and assumes he is confirming his "offer" to take care of the check. she smiles, takes my tip, wishes me a nice day and i'm off. but not without first ordering a side salad to be sent to my new friend the sea cow, along with a hand written note in a folded up napkin that states "i, too, know how to suggest food that seems consistent with body mass."after reading for hours of peoples' brilliant revenge i felt compelled to share my singular moment of glory. to set the stage, here's a little background. back in high school, i was more of a nerd than not, but i also had a diverse group of friends, so i had an in with most of the cliques, and those that i didn't necessarily agree with were usually far enough removed that i never had any problems with them directly. however, the few that i silently resented were public enemies of a sort. anyway, there was this one kid a year my senior, let's call him cockus the ball master, or cm for short. for the better part of my first three years, i see cm around and am generally left with a sour taste. it's the usual bullshit, calling people out for whatever reason, then taking it out on professors who try to intervene. there were a few runins with the law in cm's short and illustrious career as professional douchebag, too, but again, nothing that directly involved me. that is, until spring semester of the 11th grade. one day when we were packing up from an orchestra rehearsal (both percussionists, we happened to be in the same band this semester. it was a split campus school, and he went to the other one, but a few classes were only taught at one, and students were shuttled between them), good ole ball master accidentally left his ipod on a chair (which we later learned). well, come monday morning, he's on a warpath. cm accuses one of my good friends of stealing it, who i knew well enough to put my own reputation for his character, and then i was also accused of theft. a fly on the wall no more, i say. fuck this kid and his shit, i'm not going down for lies. a half-assed investigation gets opened by the school, but about two days later someone thinks to check with the custodial staff, and sure enough, one of the janitors picked it up over the weekend and put it in the lost and found. after that incident, cm kept a little distance from me and my friend, but there was a colder sense of animosity towards us as though we had accused him of the theft, not the other way around. by the end of the year, i hadn't had an opportunity to take revenge on cockus for what he did to us and to dozens of others (which included destruction of personal property, vandalism, and a lot of the petty shit). it seemed that my chances were slipping away, but then a good old deus ex machina came our way and he got held back another year. jackpot! karma came around and gave him a swift kick up the arse, but it was also right into our laps. **the revenge**: flash forward to spring semester of our senior year. i'm taking a biology class, and it's another one of the shared ones. guess who's there? our mate cockus the ball master. although he doesn't acknowledge our prior standing, i sure as hell do. forgive and forget, i try and live by, but sometimes life just doesn't want that to happen, so fuck him. to quickly set the stage, this biology room, like most of the building, was constructed back in the 40s, and hadn't seen many renovations since the 70s when a few additions were built. all the lab tables were that indestructible black synthetic rock stuff, each shaped like a pentagon where one side joined it to the wall. each of those sides held a row of 4 drawers, individually keyed, as well as two more columns of drawers on the walls between the island pods. there were somewhere around 8-10 of them in the room, making for a metric shittonne of drawers (around 225 of them in total). for the most part, we used the front of the classroom, but occasionally we went to the back to dissect cats and shit. one lab, i opened one of the drawers out of curiosity, but it was empty. turns out, they all were, and hadn't been used for quite some time. what a waste... ...what an opportunity a few days later, i stumbled across an old ass box filled with verdigris brass keys. i just had to know. each one was paired with an identical key on an old spiral ring, and each one went to one of the two hundred odd drawers. and that's where the plot was hatched. over the course of about two months with the help of another one of my quietly unsuspecting yet marvellously devious friends, we began mapping out where all the keys went. our professor was one of the best i ever had, and being a class at the end of the day, usually we would have some time where he would answer questions and help people with whatever, and the rest of us could do whatever work we needed to get done. that meant a few minutes every day where we could slip away to the lab tables and look like we were doing homework unsupervised. when we finally had all the keys paired to their locks, we took half a dozen or so each day and progressively locked them in different drawers. so if you had one key, you would have to find the drawer it opened, and there would be another key inside, which opened a different drawer, which had another key... you get the idea. but because there were two keys, we could keep the key for the last drawer on hand and open it whenever we wanted to, but the other was locked away in one of the drawers. and also since there were two, we unpaired them and ever fifty drawers or so, we put a mountain of the previously used keys in it. sort of like a 'congratulations, fuck you!' two weeks after we started, we locked the last key away, leaving us with the one for the final drawer, and one for the first drawer. for good measure, we made the final drawer on the top so you couldn't somehow jimmy the ones above it open and reach your hand down. by now, it was drawing near the end of the semester, and so we waited for our opportunity to give cm the petty shitstorm of a lifetime. and our chance came at the best possible time. two days before the end of the term, cockus left the room for something, and also left that fucking ipod on his desk. when the opportunity arose, i casually lifted it and some other douchey personal effects. into the last drawer they went! i had been ready for this moment for months, and looking at the inconspicuously, horrifically devious sabotage made me so happy i could sing (no one wants that). of course, cm doesn't notice that the ipod is gone, again, and leaves for the day. come the last day of classes i drop an envelope on his desk when everyone is packing their final things for the year. inside was the first key and a note scrawled the words 'want to play a game?' (this was the height of when saw was becoming popular) and come cryptic shit about what he had to do to get his things back. if i could have taken a photograph of his face when he realized what happened, i would need nothing more out of life. of course, i didn't stick around to see if he ever made it to the last drawer, but no one would help poor cockus the ball master. my only regret is that i could not have done it sooner. fuck that guy. **tl;dr** a jackass at my old senior high accused me of theft so i stole his shit and locked it in a room with two hundred keys. edit: changed the name of ole cockus the ball master because i'm not here to offend people, just tell a storymy dad is an extremely organized guy. he has to have everything in order at all times, however every once in a while he forgets stupid shit. in the late 90's my dad owned a beautiful black truck, he spent a lot of time and money making it look great. one day my mom and dad go out to dinner but decide to take my mothers white jeep instead of my fathers truck. originally they were going to take the truck but figured it would be fun to take the jeep out with the top down. this is where my dad messes up. he already had the trucks keys in his hand and while helping my mother take the top down, he left them resting on the back bumper. he immediately forgot he put them there and they drive off without a second thought. so now my dads car keys are in the middle of the street in front of our house. a man is walking around the neighborhood and spots them on the ground, he then starts to click the unlock button to see if the car is anywhere near him. my dads truck lights flash and the man decides to take a joy ride. the asshole speeds into a field and proceeds to drive as fast as he can throwing all of my dads cds and personal belongings out the window, including my dads wallet. this guy absolutely destroys the car, tons of huge dents, scratches, and the bottom of it is covered in mud, sticks, and grass. at this point my mom and dad arrive home and freak out because they are short one car in the driveway. my dad immediately remembers the keys he left on the bumper and gets pissed at himself. he wonders if the guy who took his car would be dumb enough to ride it around their neighborhood, so he takes the jeep and starts looking. sure as shit my dad finds the dumbass 10 minutes later cruising down a street by they're house. my dad passes in front of him and slows down to a stop, gets out of the jeep, walks up to the guy (who now has the window rolled down wondering what's going on) and punches him square in the face. my dad is not a very violent man, but seeing the condition his car was in mad him see red. my dad then holds the guy back with his arm and calls the police telling them he caught the guy who stole his car. the man is arrested and pays for damages to the car and all of the shit he threw out of the window. dad says the truck never quite ran the same but it was still great to catch the douchbag in his car. please excuse my spelling and grammar errors this was done on my phonestory starts out when i was 8. i was 8 years old and moved from the great outdoors of canada, down south to the hot weather of texas. my dad was a manager of an oil refinery and he got a better position as a whole sector manager. i was 8 and i was about in second or third grade, give or take. i wasn't informed of me moving until one day my mom went to school with me and checked me out. i had a couple good friends, and a lot of family in canada that i had to leave. after going on the plane the first time ever, i was so ecastic, my mother said i passed out. so when we came to texas, we had a big house! in canada we had a apartment in the city, in texas we had a nice grand big house with a front yard, 6 bed rooms. i was so happy, that i almost forgot i had school next week and had no friends. for anyone who has seen "king of the hill", imagine the houses being lined up. all the neighbors were really close. our neighbor was a cop, and he had an 8 year old son named johnathan. johnathan and i became best friends, and when school started after summer, he showed me around and helped me a lot. though johnathan told me to stay away from a boy named "ken". ken was the school bully. he would just go around and bully kids because he wanted to. i was about 3'5 at the time, i was short. ken was a whopping 4'2. ken basically had 7 inches on me, and 50 pounds. i was super scrawny compared to ken. first day i got to school i had one of the best teachers i ever had growing up, her name was miss maddy. miss maddy was about 40 years old, though real nice. she would stay after school, help students, give students bus money if they needed it. it turned out ken and i were both in miss maddy's class. on the first day of school i didn't know who ken was, though i saw some tall kid in a black shirt and i made eye contact with him. he turned and snapped, saying, "what the fuck do you want retard?". i never heard those words ever in my life, and i remember these words like yesterday, they are scarred into my head. so the year went on, and in february is where the bullying started happening. i was on the swing set, and ken just came and pushed me off. i fell into the sand face first. he and his buddies were laughing. his buddied tagged along with him, because they were mostly scared of him. i came home and told my dad. my dad told my principal, though the principal turned out to be ken's father's mother-in-law. ofcourse, she would not get ken into trouble.the principal simply told my dad, no evidence equals no proof. my dad was furious, and he had a teacher meeting arranged with miss maddy, and miss maddy said she will keep an eye out. so the bullying happened everyday, johnathan witnessed and helped me push off ken one time. now johnathan got himself into this. well, i almost forgot, johnathan's dad was a cop. i went to johnathan's dad one time while he was working on his beautiful red, 97' ford mustang. i explained to him, and explained that the princiapl won't do anything, and such and such. i told him johnathan is also on ken's target list. basically mr. white (johnathan's dad) told me that i should set up a sting. well i didn't know what that was, so he explained to me, and i followed. mr. white told me, that he and his partner, and child services would be looking through an identified car and if they see me getting harassed, they will come and arrest ken for excessive bullying, harassment, assault, etc. so i explaiend to johnathan, and johnthan and i made a plan, and told mr. white what was going to happen. the next day i saw ken walking up to me and johnathan, so we both quickly ran past him while saying something outloud. the phrase we said was, "meet me at the back alley of corner street, i'll trade you the shiny pokemon card". pokemon cards in the school went for quite a bit of money. i knew ken wanted that card, and would do anything to get his hands on it. so i had the card, and johnathan and i met up at corner street at 5 pm. guess who comes a long at 5:10? ken and his buddies. basically they walked up, and one of his buddies said, "hey give me the card and no one gets hurt". we saw a white pick up pull up, and just quietly turn off their engines. no one noticed, not even johnathan. i said, "no, this is my card, you've been bullying me all year, screw off". he replied to me, give me the card or i will break your arm. i said no with a smirk on my face. ken ran up with his buddies and head butting me. mr white, his partner, and a child services worker jump out of the car and rush to the scene. they put handcuffs on ken and his buddies, and sit them down at the curb while their parents came. ken's buddies started crying, saying that he made them do it, and they just kept crying. mr. white wasn't going to arrest them, he was going to scare them so they will never bully again. then ken started crying, saying how he's sorry and he will never bully again. they bring in a squad car, load them up, and take them to juvi. mr white told me this after it happened. in juvi they put them in a holding cell, scaring the living shit out of them. ken and all his buddies were crying for forgiveness. then mr. white led them, they're still handcuffed around juvi, and showing them what kinds of kids are there, and if they wanted to join them. they started crying again. then, all their parents came, picked them up. the principal was put under investigation for allowing students to get bullied, and ken moved places. ken's buddies then in middle school, and high school, became straight a students, and were friendly with everyone. one of them even came out as gay. moral of the story- don't bully my friends and i. tl:dr- kids bullied me, they got handcuffed and started crying, never bullying anyone again.years ago i worked at a plus-sized women’s clothing store in a bad part of town. the store was part of a national chain and its clothing was designed for the younger crowd. our store was not part of a mall but was part of a strip mall that sat right up against some low income housing. i really enjoyed working there because i got to help people shop. i also enjoyed helping plus-sized girls feel beautiful. my pay was barely above minimum wage but my husband works in it and he makes enough money to keep us comfortable. there were a few things i didn’t like about my company. for one, they made us sell magazine subscriptions at the register that were basically a scam; it’s 25 cents a year now but you’ll be charged an inflated rate next year for a renewal. i felt bad because i knew many of my customers were low income and probably wouldn’t remember to cancel. the other thing we were required to do is aggressively push our store credit card. i wasn’t good at pushing the magazines or the credit cards and it was no secret that our regional manager was not pleased with my performance. despite having amazing sales numbers, because my magazine and credit applications were low i was treated poorly by my store manager, gina, and the regional manager, rick. out of all of the associates, i was the only one that had trouble getting magazine subscribers and credit applicants. i later discovered that one of the associates had a boyfriend that was also a drug dealer. he would give his drug customers a discount in exchange for their personal information and social security numbers so his girlfriend could run their info on credit applications. this associate was best friends with our store manager, gina. this girl shared all of this information with all of the associates except for me. i later heard that i was resented because i was a “rich white bitch”. another crappy part of working at this store was dealing with shoplifters. even though the city’s police station was across the street from our store, people would come in and try to pull a fast one on us. if we knew someone was shoplifting, one of the associates would start a conversation with a shoplifter while the other associate went in the back room to call the police. our store had no anti-theft systems and it had no security cameras. because our amount of “shrink” was so high, our store was put on probation and we regularly had a company come in and take inventory of our merchandise. we knew how much our store was losing every three months. corporate sent down some head honchos from loss prevention that would interview us one at a time and try to figure out if one of the staff was stealing. the man they sent was named jack. jack gave me his name and cell number and told me i could call him if i noticed or suspected any of my coworkers was stealing. on one of the days that our merchandise was going to be inventoried the regional manager, rick, arrived. this was odd because rick lived in the neighboring state somewhere. he must have left his home at 4 am to be there when we opened. rick spent the day manipulating the inventory results. he would do things like make the people taking inventory scan empty shoeboxes and inventory shirts twice. i went home and wrote down everything that i remembered. on july 3rd i received a text from gina. she wanted to know if i had set aside a particular shirt to purchase for myself. she sent a picture of the shirt. i told her it was not mine. the following day i noticed gina had posted pictures of herself at a july 4th barbecue wearing the shirt. when i got to work the following day, i checked the inventory. no associates made any purchases at all that week. that shirt was never sold, in any size, at our store but one was missing from the racks. gina had stolen it. i went home and i created a powerpoint presentation with screenshots of my text messages with gina about the shirt, details from our inventory, and pictures from gina’s facebook page showing she had the shirt. i also provided the details of the credit card application scams my coworkers were running. i sent this off to jack, the loss prevention guy at corporate, and waited. within an hour my phone lit up. jack told me i would be transferred to any store i chose for coming forward and i was rewarded with a $100 gift card. he told me they knew about the credit card applications being fake because the same 20 people were applying over and over again. i knew that no matter what store i chose, rick would still be my boss, so i told jack i would think about it. when i got to work the following day, rick and jack were there. gina and her best friend were fired and were already gone. within one fucking week, i was being written up for not having enough credit apps. i quit right then and there. i went home and called jack and told him about rick’s inventory manipulations. i gave a tip about our magazine program to a major consumer publication and they published stuff about it on their website. this chain used to have 20 locations in our state. now it has two. i just looked on linkedin and rick still works for the company. oh, well. i feel like i got revenge. edit: i just wanted to add that the story was written by my wife, and i posted it up here. i guess this is a huge deal because all of my other posts point to the fact that i'm a dude, and the fact that a couple can do things together on reddit is too much to fathom.i worked for several years as a campus safety officer at a small college. the vast majority of students were respectful and willing to be cooperative when we made contact with them. there was this one kid who was an over-the-top douchebag. he insulted us, insulted our intelligence (we all had degrees, some of us officers had advanced degrees), claimed we were too stupid to have real jobs. he never followed any of our instructions to turn down his stereo, hand over his alcohol (he was underage) or present his campus id when required. just an entitled little prick. halloween comes around and i'm working the midnight shift. it is cold out. we get a call to let a student into his dorm and then his room because he is locked out. when my partner and i arrive guess who is locked out? mr. entitled prick. his halloween costume consists of girls underwear - bra and panties - and his flipflops. he had nowhere for his keys. following our department's rules to the letter, i ask him for his school id. he doesn't have that either, no pockets in which to carry his wallet. "sorry, mr. prick. i can't open the door unless we can identify who you are and verify that you actually live in this building." "no sir. i can't let you in without your id. that is our department's rules." "no, sir, i don't recognize you." "yes, sir. it certainly is cold out tonight. you have a good evening."**background**: when i got together with my husband he had a female friend who was basically queen of one of his friend groups. i was never really close to her but i liked her, well enough, even though we were very different (she's more "girly" i'm more tomboy) fast forward 6 years and she and her long time bf are getting married. another thing you should know is that none of us are super rich, in fact the lovebirds are just a tad bit on the ghetto side. bridezilla's mom however thinks her baby walks on water and they plan a classy wedding....confusing classy with expensive. thus begins the horror of this year plus engagement or as i like to call it **"the money grab"**. these people have been living together for going on 7 years but they are going for the full white wedding. by full i mean: * two engagement parties (one with an addendum that no gifts are to be purchased, instead we should bring cash for the money tree). * 2 bridal showers (including another money tree) * out-of-town bachelorette party * a bridesmaid's tea at a fancy tea shop...where the bridesmaids paid as a gift to the motb... * various ladies' nights where whichever poor bitches showed up were slave labor for enforced craft time like making favors and tying 200 ribbons for hand engraved invitations. not to mention they were all potluck and byob so we didn't even get free food because bridezilla can even throw together some cheese and damn crackers at this time my husband and i were really struggling financially so this constant spending was hard and the guilt was constant "oh mermaids_singing! i made you one of my twelve bridesmaids out of respect for your relationship with my oldest friend! what do you mean you can't take 2 unpaid days off of work and spend $500 for my weekend long bacherlorette party????" *cue tears and phone calls to my husband and other bridesmaids asking why i don't like her* i learned that due to the "honor" of being one of 12 bridesmaids i would be forced to spend $275 on an ugly navyfuckingblue rayon monstrosity from one of the city's most expensive bridal salons. wtf??? it was the definition of "never wearing again" and probably cost $2 to make in china. and we had to find navy blue pumps to go with.... finally, we get close to the wedding, which means shelling out money for gifts... because the lovebirds have registered everydamnplace. they are treating this like the price is right. they registered for computers and flat screen tv's. they registered for 2000 thread count sheets (to go in their ghetto apartment) and finally they registered for fancy china. i think the china is what finally sent me over the edge. bridezilla does not cook. bridezilla **does not even have a table** in her apartment. bridezilla doesn't have storage big enough for the 12 place settings she registered for. and i'll be goddamned if i pay $38 for a salad bowl for anyone. so, i find myself with another bridesmaid (who is also mightily sick of this shit) standing in macy's looking over thie registry and i get a bright idea. i ask a saleslady to help me find the most useless cheap kitchen shit on this list. thus begins: grudge gifting. we track down every useless thing on the list. and we price check it to see where we can find the exact thing cheapest. special air vented pizza pan (for making your red baron extra crispy)? check. counter top mini cupcake maker, in the shape of a cupcake that makes 7 mini cupcakes (a cupecake pan costs like $5, this thing? $27)? yep. countertop fajita maker shaped like a chili pepper? chickity check! soon we have a pile of stuff that is made for garage sales. this is shit that no one uses and it's all from the registry. we buy all the shit at macy's thus getting it off the registry. then we go to walmart and target and buy the same shit. then we go *back* to macy's and return the expensive shit but neglect to give the part of the receipt that says its from a registry. so it's checked off. bridesmaid #2 and i take it home and wrap it all individually so that we have two towers of beautifully wrapped crap. crap that we have scraped the price tags off of. crap that we have neglected to attach the gift recepits for. and all crap that was specifically requested. we show up at the wedding and do our duty. everyone ooohs and ahhhs when we set our very pretty towers of crap on the gift table. after the wedding, we immediately go and change in to non horrible dresses and shoes and shove our combined $600 dollars worth of navy blue dresses and shoes in a paper sack for immediate donation to goodwill. we get our drinks from the cash bar and top them off from the flasks that we wisely snuck in. two weeks later i get a call from brideszilla trying to tactfully inquire about gift receipts.... "weren't they in there??? i could have sworn i put them in there. let me look around the house..." couple months after that a very polite thank you note. a month ago they had a garage sale....every single item was out for sale including a very dusty 7 portion cupcake maker.... **tldr:** prorevenge is getting you *exactly* what you want and having you thank me for it. **holy shit! reddit gold. thanks kind internet person!** my grandfather had been a soldier, boxer, police officer, and eventually became a farmer shortly after my father was born. we're from a small community in canada where everyone knows everyone and having a person bully others just isn't okay. my grandfather's farm was quite large. acres upon acres of potatoes and grain, over 5000 laying hens, and a sizable herd of pigs. but as all farmers at the time were, the local bank owned much of the farm. one year was a particularly rough year for them. disease had spread through the pig barn and the entire herd was lost. this was devastating as it was their most valuable source of income. my grandfather had made arrangements with the bank that the grain harvest (which normally fed the pigs) would be sold to make payments on the loans to the bank. the banker was great with this. the problem arose when a new loan officer moved to the community and took over my grandfather's account. he demanded payment much earlier than what had been previously agreed. the revenge started with my grandfather inviting the banker out to the farm to discuss terms. they were walking through the completely empty pig barn. this was the type of barn where the manure from the pigs would flow out of the stalls, into a trough, and down to the end of the barn, filling a massive pit. because of all of the recent rain in the area and the lack of use of the barn, the water had filled this pit and a nice layer of straw dust had settled over the entire thing. this caused two things. first, the concrete walkways were only raised about an inch over the manure filled water, and secondly, unless you knew where you were going or looking down intently, it was easy to step off of said walk way. well the meeting wasn't going well. they were walking through the barn to the end of the row and my grandfather wasn't too pleased. they were walking with the banker in front, my grandfather behind him, and my father taking up the rear. as they came to the end of the row, the deep pit of manure was in front of them. my father saw that the banker was about to walk straight off of the path so he reached out to grab the banker when out of nowhere my grandfather slapped his hand back and watched as the banker stepped off of the end in his suit and right up to his neck in pig manure. they grabbed a rope to help the poor guy out but wouldn't let him in the house to wash off at all. he ended up hosing himself off in the barnyard and driving back to town smelling like a million bucks. needless to say, the grain harvest came in a few weeks later and as originally agreed on, my grandfather made the payments.first ever reddit post, be gentle. also pretty long and on mobile, so apologies. years ago, probably 7 at least, i was giving my good friend a ride to and from chemotherapy. on the way back, i was pulling into the street from a parking lot, and a guy was nice enough to stop in the middle of dense traffic to let me out. as i'm inching in, another guy in the next lane is pulling into the same vacated space. i'm irritated, but no huge rush, we're all trapped in traffic anyway. we finally pull out onto the main road, me in the right lane, other douche in the middle to my left. suddenly, for no apparent reason, this douche comes slowly drifting into my lane. i tap the horn, but she keeps coming, forcing me to jump onto the curb and take a solid amount of concrete dust with me. coming off the curb forces me into a swerve across the lanes, luckily our two cars were leading the pack, i'm shook up a bit, and my buddy is already nauseated as all hell, so i'm mad. i figure it was some idiot not paying attention, so i look to my left (now perpendicular to the road), and see a dumb bitch in the driver's seat laughing, full on guffaws! i'm furious now, so i step out to dead silence beyond her stupid laughs, despite the fact that i'm blocking off 2 and a quarter lanes of traffic with my shitty little toyota tercel. here is where i should point out i'm about 6'4" hopping out of a vehicle that is approximately half my size. i was in decent shape at this point in my life, but the contrast of me to my car still makes the gas station attendant laugh to this day (he knows what a nice guy i am, they do not). so anyway, i get out, silence, girl looks up and stops laughing. she has her girlfriend with her in the back seat, and a dudebro in the passenger seat. i unleash a horrible fury of insults and just absolute madness at her, finally i pause and i hear "don't talk to my girlfriend that way, bro". i snap, scream that i'll talk to his dumb cunt of a woman however the fuck i please, and then i start to calm down a bit. still abso-fuckin-lutely furious, but i see clearly that a severe talking to isn't enough. i go back to my car, grab a bottle of half full water i drop cigarette butts into so i don't litter, and walk up to their car that is trapped hopelessly between my car and the backed up traffic. thwack. smash it against the driver's side window past the boyfriend and watch the disgusting sludge that has been baking in the florida heat drip down the car's interior. i walked back and drove off, no aftermath. thanks for dealing with me, good people!so back in high school, aged 15,, i realised i was gay, but i hadn't told anyone at school, what i was doing though was hooking up with guys using faceparty (old school right) my account never had my real name on, and only one picture, so to find it you really had to know what you were looking for, or you were looking for other gay people. so the asshat of the school finds my profile some how and starts immediately telling everyone that i'm gay and he found my profile etc, so i started getting questions about it all day long, after the first few i started ask the question, my profile is pretty private, how did he find it without searching for gay guys, thus putting the seeds of doubt in place. that night when i get home, i mocked up a faceparty profile for this guy, used his email, his pictures, one his usernames from msn, and a little sob story about being closeted and not wanting to be found out. then screen shotted the profile and printed off a lot of copies took them into school the next morning and got one onto every desk in his home room, and several pinned around the school. it was confirmed, the guy searching for gay guys was actually gay and had a secret gay account. guy went absolutely off it. everyone thought he was gay for weeks. best part was after about 3 weeks of everyone taunting him and loving me, he tried to take a swing at me. i nutted him, and fell to the floor, and thus sealed his legacy as the guy who was outsmarted and then beaten up by the gay guy of the school. mine was, i dated an extremely abusive guy right after my divorce. found out his divorce wasn't finalized and he went into her house and emptied it so she came home to an empty house. he had a $1m car collection he also hid. he trusted me by telling me where all the stuff was hidden. he had to go to court because the judge ordered him to produce all the belongings. he denied knowing where they were. after i had enough of his abuse (nine months), i went into his work and got her phone number off his computer and called her. she invited me over and i told her where everything was. a week later, she got her attorney to tell the judge so he obviously granted her possession of everything. i watched from two blocks away all the furniture, cars, etc get hauled off by her. he had to serve six months in prison because he was found in contempt of court's orders. his business also went under. it was exhausting for me to do all of this, but totally worth it. edit to add: i just divorced for two months when i met him. he was the polar opposite if my ex so i thought things would be ok. i was 27 and he was 54. the first three months were bliss. wining, dining, going places and meeting friends. all the sudden, mr. hyde showed up and i found out he was going through his fourth divorce. then the abuse started. calling me fat, telling me i dressed like a whore, had to always pick out what i wore, hated everything i did and when i follows his suggestions, it still wasn't good enough. nothing i did was ever good enough. then the physical abuse started. grabbing me and shoving me, taking my arm and twisting it until it hurt. he was sadistic. i was like a science experiment to him. he talked about all his exes all the time. he delighted in fucking with them (stalking, intimidating). the few times we saw her out, she had the look of concern on her face when she looked at me. i finally had enough if his shit. i was 27/28 and in the best shape of my life and this old mother fucker was ruining me. that's when i decided to be proactive and make it count. i told myself i wasn't going to be another woman he succeeded in fucking over, so i teamed up with his last ex and we nailed his ass to the wall. i just found this short story on the csgotrade subreddit in a thread where someone was asking for advice on how to deal with a scammer: when i was still in school (grade 11) i forgot my pencil case in the lobby once and someone took most of the stuff out of it, then cut stripes into it with my scissors. everything that was left were my scissors (which he/she broke apart) and some trash of some "rare" candy inside the case. and someone wrote "alexander speier" (a guy in my grade) on the pencil case but the first and second name were clearly written by different people. so my only chances to find out who did this was the name on the pencil case, the candy trash or to find a person who was using the stuff i had in my pencil case. after school i decided to go through the rooms that were being used by my grade because i thought i might find some of my stuff. i ended up finding the empty candy box which was the source of the trash in my pencil case under one of the tables and i ended up finding out that one of the three people at who were sitting at the table was also named alexander. i figured out that one of his friends wrote his name on my pencil case while they were having their fun with it and he quickly completed the name with the second name of some other guy and that's why the names were written by different people. his handwriting matched the writing of the second name "speier" and i saw him playing with the neodymium magnets i had in my pencil case. i now had 2 options. either take my revenge or go to the principle and try to get my stuff back. because the stuff in my case was only worth about 40€, me and a friend of mine started to plan revenge. i waited about 1 year so that he doesn't get too suspicious at first... we stole his pencil case (i got my neodymium magnets back) and kept waiting. 3 weeks later i also stole his new pencil case. i was now "sitting" on two of his pencil cases. i took all the stuff out and threw most of it away (nobody could track it all back to me). i then slashed the 2 cases the same way he did with mine, i also bought the same candy as he did and put the trash into the pencil cases and i wrote "alexander speier" on the two pencil cases in "print-writing". i placed some of my poop in a small plastic bag and placed it in one of the cases and put 5 packs of stink bombs (3 vials each pack) in the second one. i knew that he always left his bag unattended before going to computer class in the break between the 6th and 7th hour. i put the 2 pencil cases into his bag, stepped on it to burst the bag with my shit in it and to break the stinky bomb vials (or at least most of them.... i didn't really care if all were broken) while my friend kept watch. we then got back into the building after the break with the other people to see his reaction. 5 years later i still sometimes feel a little happy when i remember his face and his tears :) *by the way: he had to throw everything away because he couldn't get the smell of the stinky bombs out of his leather bag.* it cost me a lot of work and 10€ for the stinky bombs.... but it was worth every minute and every euro.this is from a couple of years ago. leaving work and walking towards my car i notice the pressure in one of the tires is pretty low. i drive to the closest gas station and pull up to the air compressor, it was 75¢ so i put in three quarters and nothing happens. so i walk inside, wait patiently for the cashier to finish ringing up a customer, and then tell her "i think the air compressor is broken, i put in 75¢ and nothing happened." she looked at me and said "yeah, you'll have to go somewhere else." i was a bit taken aback so it probably took me a second to say "uh, well, don't you think you should put up a sign or something? and could i get my quarters back so i can go to another gas station?" i want to stress that my tone was was perfectly polite so i wasn't prepared for how quickly her attitude turned from unfriendly to nasty when she said "you're gonna have to eat it." if she'd said 'sorry, only a manager can do that' or something along those lines, i probably just would've left and forgotten about it, but i didn't like how she was treating me. i kept my cool and, with *very slightly* strained politeness, said "is there a manager or something who can help? i don't have any other change and my tire is really low." "nobody else. anthony's the manager, he's not here, he'll be here in the morning." "alright," i said, "thank you." the next morning, i call the store and the lady who answers sounds like the same cashier. i ask for anthony. "he left before six, he's getting married today, gonna be on his honeymoon for two weeks." "oh, i was there yesterday and i was told he'd be in this morning. well, anyway, i had a problem yesterday afternoon, the air pump stole my change–" "i remember you," so it was the same lady, "i told you to come before 6. no one else gonna get your quarters for you." i started to disagree but realized i wasn't going to get anywhere so i said "okay, thanks anyway" and hung up. the gas station was a franchise of a large brand, so i wrote a quick e-mail to their customer service address. the next morning i get a phone call from the regional manager at the franchisee, which turned out to be a company which owned quite a few gas stations in the area. he apologized for my experience, said they've been having trouble with this store, and asked me to describe the cashier, which i did and he said he'd look into the matter further. he also wanted to reimburse me the 75¢, i told him i was just happy he was taking the matter seriously and that i didn't really care about the money, but he mailed me a dollar and a couple of free car washes anyway, so that was nice. i hadn't expected to hear anything else, but i was very surprised a few days later when the same manager called me again just to tell me that mrs. nasty attitude had been fired for a string of issues including mine as well as accepting bad checks. i felt bad for about half a second, but she was mean, lied, and provided terrible customer service, apparently serially.so, there are a lot of dogs in my cousin's locality, both pets and strays. one of his neighbors (let's call him dt) is a professional dog trainer, and an awesome guy all around, and lives a few houses down. a few houses ahead at the end of the same row lived an old cranky hellspawn bitch who was an overall nightmare. let's call her cranky old bitch (cob). basically, dog owners in our city are not required to clean up after their dogs, but it's a common understanding that this applies to dogs pooping in the wild overgrown patches of *'natural green belts^tm '* on one side of most roads. cranky old bitch had the shittiest pomeranian i've ever seen, an untrained, bad tempered monster that shit all over the middle of the road (never in front of her own house, of course). people complained, but cob didn't do a damn thing. cut to a few months ago. dt is walking his dog (a *magnificent* alsatian that's the smartest dog i've ever seen). his dog pauses in the grassy patch opposite cb's house to poop. cue cb shrieking from her balcony like a harpy: &gt;cob: oi! move your ugly dog away! &gt;dt: what? &gt;cob: make your dog poop elsewhere! not in front of *my* house! &gt;dt: &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232; needless to say, it's not very practical to move a dog while he's pooping, so dt ignored her. that evening, the cob actually made her maid pick up the poop with newspapers and then threw it right at dt's gate. my cousin was walking home at the time and saw her doing it, and assumed that she'd finally gone batshit crazy. &gt;cousin: what the hell are you doing cob?! &gt;cob: i told him not to allow his dog to poop opposite my house, didn't i? he can have his filthy dog's poop back! &gt;cousin: but- cob just turned and walked back to her house, cackling like a goddamn witch. he called dt outside and told him what happened. dt just said "i'll take care of it." he went and talked to cob, but she was an insane unreasonable bitch as usual. dt came back really, really angry. early next morning, my cousin saw him walking down towards cob's house with a small bucket and a few bottles. when he came back, he asked dt what he'd done, but dt only winked and told him to wait a few days. he still hasn't told my cousin exactly what he did, but apparently he applied some kind of dog pheromone (i think?) to cob's gate. since then ***every single dog in the locality*** has been pissing at cob's gate. may not seem like much, but there are like **fifteen** stray dogs in the area. all pissing at her gate. every single day. yeah. cob hosed down the gate at first, then kept trying to drive the dog's away, but they kept coming back, and i think that dt reapplied whatever it was to her gate. eventually, slovenly hag that she was, cob gave up, and even stopped washing the urine away. now there were *puddles* of piss at her gate at all times (and occasionally giant turds), stinking like a godawful cesspool. her own dog contributed to them every day. and dt? nope, he didn't give her any excuse to berate him. sickly sweet courtesy. expressed concern over her problem. walked his dog far away from her house. his was probably the only dog that hadn't pissed at her gate. cob must've suspected dt, but couldn't prove that he'd somehow turned her front gate into a giant dog urinal. she finally had to move to her daughter's place in a different city. tl;dr: crazy old bitch throws dog poop at dog trainer's gate, pheromone magic, her gate is now a giant doggy toilet.it happened 5 years ago. i (white atheist male) was living with my (now ex) girlfriend (arab ex-muslim female). her religious parents knew nothing about our relationship and our landlord was aware of our situation and agreed keep it secret if her parents ever showed up unannounced at our apartment. he was nice but he demanded to be paid cash and he refused to gave us receipts as proof of payment. we had no problem with rent money so everything was fine with us. when we found a better apartment we gave him notice that we were moving and he was angry because he didn't want to find new tenants. he said it was illegal because we gave him a 2 month notice and the law here says it must be at least a 3 month notice. well, guess what? since we rented the apartment for less than a year the law says a 1 month notice is enough. so he called my (ex) girlfriend family to let them know about us to get revenge. her mom cried and her dad was mad at her. my (ex) girlfriend cried and i was mad at him. my revenge? after we moved out i kept a copy of the lease and i called both canada revenue agency and quebec revenue agency to let them know about a landlord who possibly didn't pay his taxes. a few months later my former landlord called me to insult me. he said he never reported his renting income and now he knew he was in deep shit. it made me smile 5 years ago and it still makes me smile today.over the course of my mom's life she's experienced quite a bit of sexism and oppression, as a woman who grew up in 1960's/70's michigan and then went to college to study to become a pharmacist (a very progressive woman). not the least of which is the one time in 8th grade that her teacher slapped her across the face for spurning his advances and caught no flak for it (except the ass-kicking my grandpa unloaded "off the books", according to my uncles), but that's a story for a different time. also, i apologize for any possible plot points that may seem hazy, since it's been a few months since i last heard her tell this story. anyway, in the early 1980's my mom, who we'll call sue (not her real name), was studying at med school at a major mid-west university to become a pharmacist. one of the things that my mom has always had was a stellar work ethic and a drive to succeed, which showed in her schoolwork, especially when she scored a 100% on one of her midterms! the course whose exam she got this amazing perfect score on was taught by a professor that she didn't care for. according to her this guy was a natively middle eastern man who exhibited very conservative, sexist ideologies in his interactions with his students, but was otherwise a solid teacher. even though he was dick, my mom didn't let him get to her until she noticed that despite her stellar performance, her overall score in the class was a c-, just barely a failing grade. my mom was pissed and confused, so she visited her professor's office to confront him. according to her this is how the conversation went down approximately (sorry, idk how to green text): **mom**: hello, professor. i'd like to talk to you about my course grade. i scored a 100% on the midterm, but my current course grade is a failing grade. what's seems to be the problem? **prof**: it's near impossible for anyone to score a 100% on my exams, *especially* someone like you. you must have cheated. **mom**: someone like me? i didn't cheat. you can't prove that! **prof**: yes, a woman could not exceed her male peers's performance. and the fact that i can't prove it is why i gave you a failing course grade instead of filing you for expulsion. **mom**: professor, that's bullshit! you can't do this to a student who has fairly aced the test! i'll have you reported to the dean for discrimination (note: idk if this was a thing back then, but she said she was gonna report him for something) **prof**: look, if you can prove that you didn't cheat by taking my mid-term a second time in solitude then i will alter your grade. if you score one point less than 100%, then your grade stays where it is. although, i don't understand your persistence in this when you should have been married by now like a good girl (note: mom was 24). (my mom has dealt with pricks like this since forever, so she decides fuck it and resolves to beat him at his own stupid game) **mom**: fine. have it your way. when do i take the exam? so my mom schedules to re-take the same exam in a few days. she takes it, and for the second time, she aces it! this prof near blew his lid when he realized he had no choice but to grade her fairly, and she passed the class that final semester in med school with a 4.0 and graduates on the dean's list. fast forward 3 years, now my mom has made a career for herself right out of college with a pharmaceuticals company. she has worked hard for the past 3 years and has actually achieved a relatively high rank within her company's regional branch (vp of some sector or something). so my mom is at a pharmaceuticals convention in some city and everyone is wearing color-coded name tags (the color of one's tag indicates their rank/position in their respective company/field). she's walking around looking at the different booths and schmoozing with corporate or whatever when who does she run into but her old asshole prof! he recognizes her and greets her like nothing happened, like a prof would to any old pupil. she's polite and returns his greeting, noticing his friendly demeanor and wondering if maybe he's changed into a better person when he happily drops this question on her, "so where's your husband? is he running a panel or something?" (she hadn't met my dad yet, but he's a doctor too, an anesthesiologist. cute medical love, right?) immediately my mom laughs and says, "i'm not married. i'm here representing my company, drug corp, inc." his smile droops when he looks at her name tag, so she looks at his and is karmically satisfied for the second time when she sees that she is a full two colors his superior *3 years* out of med school. he somewhat dejectedly bids her farewell and moves on, as does she. i love my mom. tl;dr asshole sexist med school prof won't pass my mom despite her perfect test score since she's a woman and accuses her of cheating. mom retakes exam and aces it a second time, forcing him to grade fairly. three years later she bumps into him at a pharmaceutical convention, he still assumes she's some dainty homemaker-in-training, turns out she outranks him. go mom. **edit**: grammar stuff and age errormy father told me this story recently about when he worked in an office building a few decades ago. apparently, someone kept stealing the peanut butter &amp; jelly sandwich out of his brown lunch bag in the fridge most days out of the week. after the first one, he labeled his bag, but it still kept happening. he said i was still in diapers at the time. when he woke up after a full week of sandwiches missing, he decided to substitute what he found in my diaper that morning for the peanut butter that day, went into work and tossed his lunch into the fridge like normal. at lunch, he went to check the fridge, and found the sandwich on top, with one big bite missing from the corner.i was incredibly boring in high school. honors, ap, lead in orchestra, journalist in school paper... you know the type. my parents raised me not to question authority, just shut up and do what you're told. then i suffered for two years with my french teacher and totally lost it. i took french because i loved the language and genuinely wanted to learn it. most of the students in my class were that way, since spanish and german were said to be easier and more fun. there were a few class clowns, but no worse than in any other classes. this woman. jesus, this woman. she had no business being a teacher. it was no secret that she hated males, especially non-white males. the class believes this was, at least in part, due to the fact that her daughter got knocked up by a black guy and thus named her granddaughter a very ghetto-fabulous name. we knew this because she frequently babysat her granddaughter and would take her to school, forcing us to entertain her. she'd forego the lesson and instead do something that her granddaughter would like to do, like play games. this wasn't really a problem, because who wouldn't prefer to goof off? the issue was that we'd still be tested on the material she failed to cover that day as if it were our problem that she had to babysit that day. ridiculous. on days she wasn't babysitting, she'd also answer her phone in the middle of class and talk to her daughter and make plans for the weekend. at one point, the study guides were being ripped out of the french 2 books, presumably for cheating purposes. she outright accused our class of doing it. when one student chimed in and asked why it couldn't be one of her other 3 classes, she told us we were the only class that would do something like this. wow. way to falsely accuse a class of vandalism. she was quite a bully and verbally abused students in front of the entire class. her biggest pet peeves included coughing and yawning. should a student yawn or cough, she'd become irate and tell them how rude it is, even if they covered their mouth. after a good 5 minutes of public abuse, she'd send them out of the classroom to "deal with them later," and would subsequently either leave the door open while yelling at them outside or simply forget about them. she left one student outside in the rain for nearly the entire 50-minute class period and then, when reminded, couldn't recall why she sent him out there in the first place. one time, she sent the two class clowns outside together for disrupting the class. apparently, one of them let out a fart so rancid that the other puked on the asphalt. when the teacher went outside to talk to them, she got angry at this for some bizarre reason and forced the one that puked to clean it up. with a dixie cup. the bell rang and class let out in the middle of this, and she forced him to stay and continue cleaning it up, much to his humiliation. when the class clown keeps his blushed head down and doesn't have any jokes to throw back at the people teasing him, you know the punishment went too far. anyways, this lady was a waste of teaching space. so i decided to type up an anonymous letter saying so. i bullet-pointed everything she does that is more disruptive to the class than the class clowns ever could be. i told her that she is depriving us of an education. i requested that the class environment change and that she stop publicly berating students and discipline them privately. i was firm, yet polite, in telling her that if nothing changes i will be going to the principal. this is still my teacher, and she deserves a chance. however, i stopped caring about respect when she spent the entire class period the next day yelling at the whole class, insulting me to everyone without even knowing it was me. i was a coward, rude, disrespectful, i should teach the class myself, i don't know what i'm talking about, no one agrees with me, she's a fantastic teacher, she's not racist or sexist, etc etc. she shared my private letter with the class and said some pretty humiliating things about this ghost writer. screw this woman. i gave her two months to change things around. they got exponentially worse. so i did what i threatened to do - wrote another anonymous letter to the principal. i explained everything and pleaded for help. she wasn't in class the next day, and i guess there wasn't even time for a sub to be called because a security guard sat in on the class. i was the only one that knew why. we had a sub for the rest of the week, and everyone was making speculation as to why she's been gone for so long. some even happily joked that she died or has cancer. i sat quietly just waiting for the outcome. the next week, she returns to class with a somewhat different attitude, and announces to the class that she has been offered early retirement and she is going to take it. holy shit. i just got my french teacher fired. bitch totally deserved it. last day of class, party period. teacher couldn't care less about the class or the school since she's gotten the can. one of my classmates sitting near me brought up the letter, wondering if that's what got her fired. yep. it did. "how are you so sure," they asked. because i wrote it, stupid. ohhhhhhhhhh shit. the quiet girl got the teacher fired! the next year, in french 3, everybody freaking loved me. i was suddenly ms. popular in one class, the one that saved us and got a new teacher. the teacher hired for the next year was the sub we had for that week the teacher was getting fired... and she knew. she told me, "i hope i can do better than ms. teacher, because i don't want the same thing to happen to me!"in order to keep a long story short i won't go into full detail but here's some backstory. i moved in to a new basement apartment with two girl friends from school. the landlords lived upstairs with family. within the first week we had been experiencing harassment not only from the landlord but the landlord's family as well. we were being harassed weekly. it had gotten so bad that we had called the cops on them numerous times. they refused to perform basic repairs in our unit, they came around screaming and swearing in our faces over petty stuff because it was "their house" and they felt invincible. little do they know that i know my rights and am not afraid to stand up for myself. eventually we got a notice that they were trying to evict us. this notice included all the things we supposedly "did to them". they accused us of assaulting them, housing an illegal grow op (none of us smoke in the slightest), destroying city property, and luring them in to our unit to harass and assault them. well after this all happened i went in to super research mode in which i tried to dig up as many of my rights as possible to use against them when it came time. i found out that in my city, you must possess a rental license in order to legally rent a part of your home. i then found out that particular house did not possess one, they had been skirting fees and laws for years and they couldn't obtain a license due to safety and zoning issues. i found out that if the city were to find out, the landlords could be faced with a large fine and we would be evicted. what did we have to lose? they were trying to evict us anyway. so i called the city and alerted them to the illegal rental unit the landlords were running. fast forward a few weeks to our trial date. turns out the landlords wanted to settle out of trial because someone had informed the city of their rental unit and they could not obtain a proper license. if the city were to evict us, the landlords would be in violation of the tenancy agreement and we would have won our case and then some. we settled on termination of our lease and our deposit was to be returned to us. oh and they can also never rent that apartment again, because it is not legal to do so. tl;dr - landlords harassed us from the get go. they made our lives hell for the time we rented. turns out a bit of research for clarification revealed a city bylaw and the landlords are forced to cease renting indefinitely. ever since i was a little girl i was always excessively bullied. mostly it was because of the fact that i had a male body. i'm a transgender woman but it took me years to figure that out so for the time that i was in public school i was just a very effeminate male bodied kid. obviously that tends to draw the wrong kind of attention with ease and ended up being one of the main reasons that i was bullied for several years. there was this one bully in particular though who throughout several years would never let up, let's call him shane. most bullies would eventually stop after bullying me after awhile because they got bored, this all happened in detroit public schools so the staff there usually didn't care or thought the bullying of a effeminate male bodied person was justified to beat the queer out of me as some called it, shane was part of a small core group though that continued to stick around and make my life hell for several years. for years his bullying was most of the standard physical violence and name calling. around fifth grade though his bullying changed a bit and got weird. he still did the standard bully practices but after awhile he started sexually harassing me. to this day my theory is that he is a closeted gay man. everyday he would at least feel me up inappropriately grabbing my butt, feeling up my chest, or crotch and say weird things like, "you'd probably enjoy this because you're a faggot." and that was just the daily minimum. everyday i'd come crying to the principle or other adults asking for help and they'd ignore me and tell me to stop complaining and on a few instances i was told it was my fault no matter what i did no one would help me. fast forward again to seventh grade shane is still pulling this shit on an almost daily basis to the point where i have become numb to it but i still feel rage towards him and i plotted everyday on how i would end his life. finally my day came, we had a new gym teacher, lets call him nace, come in who was not from around the area and you could tell because he was bright, cheery, delightful, and wouldn't let students get away with anything because the horrible city hadn't gotten to him yet. he had also just recently got his degree so he was fairly new to teaching and fairly hopeful of what he would accomplish. i knew that this guy would be the key to finally bringing shane down the problem was finding the perfect time to strike. one day shane made a bad move while we were in the locker rooms changing he brought along some of his buddies and trapped me in a part of the locker room and proceeded to call me degrading and bigoted insults while taking photos of me changing, i knew this was the time to strike. we had some dusty ass gym floors because the janitors never really cleaned up the gym so i got some on my fingers and rubbed it really hard into my eyes so i'd start tearing up all over the place and i went over crying to nace and told him what happened. his jaw dropped to the floor and he immediately ran over to shane and dragged him into his office. later nace pulled me into his office and told me what he did he confiscated his phone and found the pics on it the immediately sent the kid home and phoned the police. at this point i was freaking out because i didn't want to go and testify against the guy in court i was afraid he'd find a way to make my life worse but nace told me not to worry and that he'd take care of it. several months later nace pulled me into his office again and told me the whole story that he went to court for me and told the people there that he had to confiscate shane's phone and that he immediately phoned the police after he found the photos on the phone and that shane got thrown away for possession of child pornography but they went a bit easier on him since he was a kid himself. fast forward to a few months ago i no longer live in detroit i'm now off in a nice quiet city going to college and getting my degree in it. i went back to detroit though to visit some people and shock a few people with my recent transformations because i love the dumb look people give me when they see me as the happy woman i am now. while i was in a store getting some snacks for a night of counter strike with an old friend of mine i ran into shane at the store. i recognized him, but he didn't recognize me, let's face it though not a lot of old people i know recognize me now. i was happy to see that it looked like his life was going nowhere he looked like shit, bought his snacks with foodstamps, and has a house arrest ankle bracelet on. i left that store with a bag full of tasty treats and the best feeling in the world knowing that everything in my life was now awesome and his life was in the gutter. tl;dr possibly super closeted gay man bullies and sexually harasses me for most of grade school and some of middle school takes nude pictures of me on his phone i then use that to put him away for awhile. i run into him again a few months ago he doesn't recognize me but i recognize him and i become deeply satisfied when i learn his life is now shit and my life is going pretty awesome. i meant to share this story some time ago but it slipped away from me until i remembered today. it's a shame to keep it to myself, although it is a little sad in places, but i hope you can enjoy it. about a year ago around this time my mother was approaching her last days. she had lived a hard life and it caught up with her all too quickly. she didn't have much left to her name but she made sure i had possession of her car. it was an absolute wreck despite having a good engine and i knew it would never sell, but it was all she had to give. not long after she had passed away i was contacted by the welfare type agency she had been getting support from. they said my mothers spouse or dependents were entitled to sum of money to help pay for final arrangements. i was happy to hear this as i had had to pay for the funeral by myself and the expense had really hurt me. however, they didnt want to give the money to me. i was a year outside their range for dependents. instead, since my parents had divorced an eternity ago, they wanted to give the money to my younger sister. my deadbeat sister. who had run out on my mother while she was ill, stolen from her to buy drugs, and only showed up at her death bed to scream at her. they told me the money would go to her or it would vanish. i was torn over what to do but remembered that my sister had recently had her car impounded. with cold certainty i knew what i needed to do. i gave them my sisters contact info and had my father get in touch with my sister. i would "sell" her the car for the majority of what they were giving her, which was honestly not a terrible deal. she tried to haggle but she needed a car too badly. a week later, fighting against her wanting to meet up at every shady place imaginable, we meet up in a public spot and made the exchange. i had a friend with me at the time for backup and he could do nothing but stare goggle eyed at the events that took place. it's easiest if i lay them out like this. - she had blown her portion of the money on a fair amount of meth and was stoned out of her mind. - after taking the car from me she learned that it's tank was on *fumes*. she tried to argue and the three creepy dudes she had with her wanted to make a scene but they couldn't do a thing while we stood in a crowded supermarket parking lot. - as they drove off i informed my friend that i had been unable to find the title for the vehicle and that it was still registered under my mothers name and was most certainly **not** in the glove box of that car. additionally, my sister has an expired license and has a warrant out for her arrest due to evading parole. i very nearly dialed the non emergency line to report the car as stolen after this. i should have, considering she was driving it while fucked up and could have killed someone, but my father had begged me to give her a chance. either way it ended up with the same result. a week later the car was found abandoned and was impounded just like her previous car. she was picked up as well and learned that she was going to *real* prison this time instead of a short stint in a youth correction center. she's still there now and will be for the next several years. i may not have put her there myself but i unloaded a burden onto her and got what should have rightfully gone to me back first. throwaway for obvious reasons. about a month ago, one of my friends came over to hang out. we were having a good time, but he looked nervous to the point that it was killing me. i had to ask what was bothering him, and that was where my life got turned around. he showed me a facebook post from my upstairs neighbor (we live in an apartment) that stated that she was going to break into my apartment and break the living shit out of all our electronics because we're "too loud". one of the major complaints i have about this apartment complex is that the walls between apartments on the same level are like steel. my neighbors can be throwing a party and i would have no idea. however, the ceiling is paper thin and you can hear conversations verbatim. i've lived in dorm rooms that have the same type of material surrounding the room: ceiling, floor, and walls. i'm used to it. however, my neighbors have way too high of expectations living in an apartment complex. when we first moved in, they constantly commented on hearing our conversations and how they know what tv shows we watched. at first, it was kind of laughable, but the comments turned into complaints. my husband told the male neighbor (his friend) that there's nothing he can do about it at all, except move out. this is out of the equation since we are waiting for our house to be build (new construction) and we refuse to break a lease to move to another apartment for a few months only to move into our house. up until last month, we haven't heard too much. the facebook post was absolutely shocking and i was pissed. if this woman publicly threatened my property, what else would she be capable of doing? i confronted the situation and told her to take down the post. she said some nasty things to me, and i told her that my request was simple: you should not go to social media to deal with your issues and you need to direct your concern to the person directly involved. anyway, my husband's aunt is a lawyer. she provides us help with legal situations if necessary, and has been a big help for some of our other relatives. over christmas break, i was talking to her about the situation and explained how i didn't feel safe. this woman has a history of drug abuse and violence that i don't trust. in addition, i'm currently 7 weeks pregnant and want to protect myself and the baby. my lawyer then pointed out that because of my profession as a public official, this threat and any future aggression toward me is a class 3 felony in my state that would result in 2-5 years in prison if convicted. i was absolutely shocked that i would qualify under that law's specific protection, and my lawyer suggested that she would write a letter detailing possible legal action if this woman decides to do anything against me. the letter was delivered today. i heard a lot of "holy shit" from upstairs, and i'm guessing that she called her husband to complain about me. i'm sitting downstairs dealing with my life. after all, i'm battling morning sickness 4-5 times a day and will be responsible for a life soon. edit: i also feel horrible that the husband of the upstairs neighbor is one of my husband's friends. i know that you can choose your friends, but can't choose their significant others. i think the general hatred toward us was not expected by my husband and he is hurt that someone would allow their so to do the to their friend.my kid sister was friends with the neighbor girl, let's call her biana. biana was a total bitch with a very rank-oriented view of the neighborhood. she had a seething hatred for me. i was out playing in the yard and went to talk to my sister. i round the bushes and discovered biana was with her, and i had dared approach without permission from the bitch queen. i don't know why i decided to continue walking over to talk to my sister, as i was a fragile kid and her friend was constantly chipping away at me. she eventually interrupted us. cuntbeast: "you're annoying." me: "i'm okay with it." cuntbeast: "leave" me: "i live here." cuntbeast: "if you don't leave, i am going to kick you in the shin." me: "you are wearing roller skates. even you aren't that mean." well, it turns out she was that mean. i took that roller skate right to the right shin. my sister and the dragon just walked away. the next day, i answer the front door and it was biana. cuntbeast: "oh, it's you. is (my sister) home?" me: "i don't know." -closes front door- cuntbeast: "you could at least check!!!!" i searched my sister, if for no other reason than to get the dragon off of my porch, and in checking her room, found her my-size-barbie. she was too lazy to put the dress back on her after she wore it, but must have felt bad about leaving it naked, as it was wearing her underwear. her underwear with a huge skidmark on it. i had a plan. i could scare the shit out of biana and embarrass my kid sister for leaving me there after the bitch kicked me. i went to my mother's room with the giant doll, which was over the front door of the house, climbed out the window, onto the roof of the porch, and threw the doll to the sidewalk behind biana, screaming "mentaluproar, don't!" the doll hit the ground, the arm broke off and flew a few feet away, biana screamed a grade-a horror movie scream, and my sister rounded the corner seeing her soiled, crippled doll paralyze her seemingly fearless friend with terror. biana actually thought i threw my sister off the roof! she never bothered me again. first post. be gentle.my apologies for the length. there is a tl;dr at the bottom. okay. so i am a bouncer. proof: username so i work at this fairly popular bar in a college town. it's a good gig and i get paid enough to live and have a good time. the first few months i worked there were awesome. getting paid to be big, on slow nights talking to girls all night, and after the bar closes we get to go behind the bar and take shots for free for as long as it takes the manager to count all the tips. it was awesome. so after a few months of working there, my grades start to slip and i tell my manager that i want to take a month off to focus on my grades. my manager is a cool dude and he says that's fine, come back when you're ready. so i get my grades up and come back a month later ready to work. a new bouncer has been hired who used to work there a few years ago. he's big and dumb so we'll call him lump. so lump thinks he's hot shit coming back to his old stomping grounds. he even goes as far to tell all the other bouncers that our manager made him the head of security. he wasn't. i'm a pretty laid back guy so i didn't care who was head of security as long as i'm getting paid. well lump is a huge alcoholic. he would come to work at 10:00 drunk as shit and try to order all the other bouncers around. lump was a better bouncer than me, simply because he was a huge asshole to everyone, so i didn't give a shit what he asked me to do as long as it wasn't too strenuous and i wasn't the only one doing it. sometimes he was a cool guy. well other times he would come in to work drunker than a one eyed catfish swimming backwards in a bird bath, and order the other bouncers around while he sat on his fat ass and drank beer that he stole (we weren't supposed to drink while on duty). i usually did not say anything, because i didn't care to have a hostile work environment. well one day he went too far. it was closing time and i went back behind the bar and me and my buddy (he can be al) did something 15 shots in 20 minutes. we were feeling good. there's usually an after party at one of my coworkers houses were we get slaughtered. lump was trying to go to this party and nobody was sure who's house it was at. so it's me, al, and lump siting outside of the bar drinking. lump tells us to get in his truck, and lets go to the party. me and al don't want to ride with lump because he's drunk as shit and it's raining really hard. well this upsets lump and him and al get into a big argument. out of nowhere lump uppercuts al to the ground and yells "fuck you!", gets in his truck, and swerves off. i felt like a bitch because i was so shitfaced that i didn't even know al got hit until after lump drove away. so me and al sat outside drinking and determining what we would do about lump. remember how i said lump used to work at the bar and then came back? yeah it was because he had gotten fired from his last 2 jobs for being so drunk all the time, so he came to a place where he could get drunk and get paid. lump drove home drunk every night. so one night, after the bar was closed, me and al were sitting outside waiting for lump to leave. he stumbles out of the front door, gets in his truck, and swerves away. i quickly pull out my phone and dial 911. i tell them that i believe there is a drunk driver on the road. he's leaving "name of bar" and heading towards "where he lives" in a red dodge pickup. they say thank you for the information. so me an al catch a ride with one of our sober friends and low and behold, what do we see? lump's truck on the side of the road, and lump in the back of a cop car. there were two cops on the route that lump was taking. me and al take appropriate shots at after party to celebrate. aftermath lump did not come in to work the next night. or all that week. my boss was informed by one of the local cops that patrols the bar that lump assaulted one of the policemen in a rage and that he was in jail awaiting trial for both that and dui. it doesn't pay to be a bully, lump. tl;dr worked with an alcoholic asshole at a bar who often drove home drunk. he punched my friend so we called the cops on him while he was driving drunk. he get mad assaults one of the cops and is in jail. also, titties.about 8 years ago my girlfriends friend had just graduated from university. she had managed to land a very high paying job in the private sector. she would constantly brag about how she was making "soooo much money" and how she had an expensive car. she would tell all her friends they need to get their asses in gear so everyone could be like her. this girl was the definition of "bitch" fast forward about 2 years, she has now landed a new (higher paying) job with the government. after being with them for about a year she "hurts" her back and is on long-term disability for months and there is no sign of her going back to work anytime soon. you would think that someone with an injured back would not do a lot of physical activity like skiing, partying at the bars, etc. she had a desk job and everyone knew she was faking. the best part about all this? she was posting pictures and adding comments on facebook about all the "fun" she was having. after months of observing this i did some research and tracked down the name of the insurance company that handles government workers. i filed an anonymous complaint and thought nothing would happen. about a year later i found out she had been sued by the government for over $35,000 in claimed wages while she was on disability. she tried to fight it in court, but the insurance company had hired a private investigator and tracked her every move. they had screen grabs of her facebook statuses as well as photos taken by the investigator from his car of her doing recreation activities proving her back was ok. she lost the fight and had to pay the $35k. she lost her job, went bankrupt and had to move back in with her parents. she is currently a 36 year old unemployed single woman living in an isolated rural area with her parents. edit: i love the idea from bellewhether about sending her the card. unfortunately she still doesn't know i did it and no one else does, so i can't send the card. however, an anonymous e-card might work! thanks for the suggestions. even my girlfriend (who is now my wife) doesn't know.this all went down about 5 years ago. me and my then wife were married for about 3 years at that point. she came from a very conservative christian family. her parents never liked me because 1) i wasn't religious and 2) i'm a democrat. they tried their best to convince her not to marry me, but to no avail. looking back i wish they had convinced her to not marry me. at some point during the marriage my wife began to withdraw sexually. we went from having sex 3 times a week to 3 times a month to once a month. she told me that she didn't really like having sex that much and that she did it mostly to please me. what i didn't know was that she didn't want to have that much sex with me because she was getting her dick elsewhere. how did i find out? well my wife was using my laptop (her laptop was being repaired) and accidentally clicked the remember me box on her e-mail. i went to check my e-mail and it redirected to hers. i saw every message she sent to this guy and basically confirmed that she was cheating on me. like any sane person who realizes their marriage is over i filed for divorce. also i alerted the other man's gf and she promptly dumped him. now, like i stated before her parents never really liked me. when they found out i was divorcing her, they went ballistic. apparently she lied to them and said that i cheated on her. i kept getting hateful e-mails from them every other week. after our divorce was final, i told her parents that she cheated on me and sent them proof. her dad e-mailed me saying he was sorry and that he's disappointed in his daughter. all i replied with was "well now you know what kind of person your daughter is. never contact me again". neither of them have contacted me since. about a year after our divorce i get a long e-mail from my ex with the subject as "thanks". i thought it would be some sort of thank you letter but it was far from that. some of it read like this: "thanks for making my parents hate me" "thanks for driving me to cheat on you" "thanks for ruining my life" that was the last i ever heard of her. her parents disowned her and she was the shame of the small town she came from. according to facebook she now lives in australia, but considering she hasn't posted anything in 3 years, i might be wrong. also, remember the gf of the guy my wife was cheating on me with? that woman is now my fiancee. i.win. tl;dr: wife cheats on me, her parents disown her and i'm engaged to the other man ex gf. win. one of my previous offices was on the top floor of a building that had retail shops on the ground floor, and the building was part of an outdoor mall. the primary shopping clientele were upper class, attractive, white women and their spoiled kids. i worked for a tech startup, and i rode my harley to work. we only had 2 reserved spots for our company of 5, which meant most of us had to park wayyyyyy out in the back of the mall parking lot after lunch. since i rode a motorcycle, i started just using the motorcycle parking that was about 25 yards from the elevator, rather than the full-size parking spots that i would've had to use if i drove a car. one day i return from lunch to find a full-size buick suv parked perpendicular across 3 motorcycle spots which are very clearly marked, and the front half of the truck is extending into the back half of a spot that's meant for a car to be parallel parked against the curb. the front door was positioned so that when the driver got out of her suv, she would have been standing on painting that said "motorcycle parking only". so, being the kind of person that hates entitlement... i proceeded to roll my bike right up against the suv, so that the driver wouldn't be able to get in using the drivers door and probably wouldn't be able to leave without knocking my bike over or moving it. since i had about 20 minutes left in my lunch break, i sat down on a bench under a tree across the street and just read articles on my phone. after about 15 minutes a woman comes up to the suv with 2 teenage girls. between the 3 of them, i'd wager they had the iq of a flea and had worked a cumulative 0 days in their lives. she walks around the truck from the passenger side, and just stops dead when she sees my bike. she calls the 2 girls over and they all share the same "omg i cant even" expression. i walk over to my bike, make sure my forks are locked (really just an excuse to make my presence known), and turn to walk away. she asks me if i can move, and i look at my watch and say "sorry, i'm on my lunch break and i'm outta time. gotta run!" and start walking away. she yells "how am i supposed to get out?" and i respond with "don't know. should've thought about that before parking in motorcycle parking" and keep walking. she threatened to move my bike, so i stopped, turned, and told her "i've already got a picture of your license plate. if my bike has a single scratch when i get out of work tonight, i'll just contact your insurance company." the look on her face was incredible, but the giggles from her (presumably) daughter and her friend were even better. apparently they liked seeing someone treat mom like she treats people. i walked back to my office, which conveniently overlooked the motorcycle parking, and called my coworkers over to watch the scene unfold. after a bit, she flagged down security who were clueless and of no help to her. she made some phone calls. i'd imagine she called hubby for a solution. eventually she resorted to climbing in from the passenger side, which was funny to watch. mainly because it was futile. once she was in the drivers seat, the full gravity of the situation sank in. because she had wedged herself into a space that wasn't a proper parking spot, the compact car in front of her and the curb behind her meant she was stuck like chuck. until this point, i'd consumed about 40 minutes of her day. i'd already gotten back to work after about the 10 minute mark, but was casually surveying the scene. at some point around an hour in, the car in front of her left which gave her enough room to leave. the satisfaction was so good that the whole charade became something of a routine for me, although she was the only one i was able to confront. apparently my antics earned me a reputation with mall security, also. not only did they start actually monitoring the situation and telling assholes not to park there, but they also tried to give me a lecture one evening about how i'm causing problems. i reminded them that since i wasn't an employee of the mall or any of its tenants, they had 0 authority over me and if they were actually doing their job, i wouldn't have to be "causing problems" and the lecture ended pretty quick. tl;dr: don't park in motorcycle spots with your giant soccer mom suv.this, dear reddit, is is a story of justice. a tale of evil clients and knights in shining qa departments. &amp;nbsp; **the setting:** our company runs a set of databases with a light website for managing reports on data, all of which is used as a customer management system for a large number of large clients that want to host websites but don't want to manage a database to sit behind it. **the heroes:** i work as a lowly qa tech in a qa department of about 8. i've been working in this place for about 5 years now and i'm frequently asked to sit in on calls with clients. they trust me enough now to leave me to get on with things and communicate with the client directly if there's anything i want to ask about. my boss is a certified legend with a degree from the college of how to earn respect. the guy lets me get on with my work and takes care of all the business side and interdepartmental politics. great boss. my good friend (who we'll call greg) works as a fairly senior member of the customer support department. greg's got my back and i've got his. if he has something come through that he needs help with or looks serious then i'll help him out. **the villain:** the client's project manager (who we'll imaginatively call... douche) was tasked with being the gateway for all communication with us and was either extremely vague or mathematically incompetent whenever he discussed the requirements for what would be delivered. when paired together, these things often mean that bad things will happen. to make things worse, this guy was intentionally insulting because he could get away with it. after all, he is a paying customer. **the pledge:** the client paid us for a piece of work where we made a custom api which we expose on our soap interface. it was a good feature, and one which our sales representatives had probably been told to try and get a client to fund for quite some time. implementing it was a nightmare because they had added some complex functionality in their requirements document just before they signed it off. all my best attempts to try to resolve inconsistencies and make it work logically fell on deaf ears and eyes that refuse to read emails. one exchange with douche on this topic went thus: &gt;*me:* hi douche, its derp at &lt;company&gt;. just calling abou... &gt;*douche:* oh hi, yeah, the slacker at &lt;company&gt;. hows it going? it should be pointed out that we were slightly behind schedule because there were a number of outstanding issues in the database procedure behind the call, hence why this was obviously my fault. &gt;*me (biting my tongue):* i'm... i'm ok... thanks. just calling about your requirements on the api which you sent throu... &gt;*douche:* oh this again? haven’t you finished that yet? &gt;*me:* well, no. you'll remember that we've delayed it due to some issues with the procedure which you've been infor... &gt;*douche:* oh for the love of.. why is it taking so long? &gt;*me:* that's what i wanted to ask about. requirement 6.5.12 says its supposed to calculate x but lower down it states the maths you want it to use. the problem is that this equation doesn't actually represent that val... &gt;*douche:* look, you're supposed to follow the specification i've written, so just do it! i don't want to hear about this again until its done! the next day my boss tells me that douche complained about me to his account manager, saying that i was being offensive and was questioning his competency. (he can read minds?!?) i then completed this piece of work, ensuring that his specification was followed to every exact instruction. **the turn:** after the best part of 6 months, and the client is about to go live with their site. they've been trying to sort out their own internal testing teams and third parties for such a long time that we ended up completing the work a full 5 months before they were even able to test it, and at this point they were going live in 3 days because that's when their marketing campaign said it would. because of these tight deadlines, they signed it off in our acceptance testing sandbox and we considered the work to be complete. i had all but forgotten that previous conversation with douche. about 3pm friday afternoon, greg from cs calls me up says he's got an issue with douche. greg now knows first hand how douchy douche can be. this is because after our work was completed and promoted to our live system, any issues they had integrating were not development issues, but customer support issues. i make my way over to cs land and this is where things get fun. &gt;*me:* 'sup greg? (sipping my coffee because these usually involve a long conversation about the functionality of features) &gt;*greg:* hey derp.you ever worked on this new api that went up for &lt;client_name&gt;? &gt;*me:* yeah, i did the verification process on it. what do you want to know? &gt;*greg:* the client seems to think it doesn't work. &gt;*me:* it was implemented to the letter. plus other clients have been picking it up and using it since it went out, haven't they? &gt;*greg:* yeah, that's what i thought when i read the documentation. ok, leave it with me and i'll let douche know. i head back to my desk and start pulling out all the documentation i have on this feature because i know exactly what's coming next. after not too long, steve (the account manager for douche) storms into qa and straight into boss' office. there's a lot of shouting and raised voices and eventually i'm called in. &gt;*steve:* would you care to explain this? steve points at an email on boss' screen. i go in for a closer inspection and it's an email from douche claiming that their launch is probably going to be a disaster because the api has “obviously not been tested at all”. i'm surprised steve believes this because he knows me and i've worked on various projects for him in the past. &gt;*me:* i was firmly told my mr douche that i was to implement it to the specification. &gt;*steve:* but the reporting section of the response that comes out is utter nonsense! it doesn't make sense! &gt;*boss:* derp, what did the specification say about this? &gt;*me:* i can grab the documentation from my desk if you like. &gt;*boss:* i think that would be a good idea. i go and fetch the documents and all the eyes in the department are on me, wanting to know what's going on. on the way back, i see boss trying to calm steve down. &gt;*me:* here it is. i slide it across the desk and take a seat. steve and boss scan through it and find where it talks about these reporting figures and wait to be spoken to. steve turns a little pale and boss smiles. &gt;*steve:* but that makes no sense! &gt;*me:* i know. &gt;*steve:* why didn't you raise this with the client? &gt;*me:* i did. i then was accused of insulting the client’s project manager and calling him incompetent. &gt;*boss:* who wrote this specification? &gt;*me:* douche over on their side did. i'm pretty sure you two would have been cc'd on the email when it came across. &gt;*steve:* well what are we going to do? we have to fix this before they go live on sunday! (it's now 3:45 friday afternoon) &gt;*boss:* no chance. we only release new code on monday or tuesday unless it's a priority 1 issue. even then, this is an api that multiple clients are now using and we'll have to be careful not to break their integrations. &gt;*me:* steve, you might want to look at section 21 on that document. steve quickly flicks to this section of the documentation where the final clause states how any modifications to this constitute as a change request and chargeable work. steve is much more calm because he knows his ass is covered. that and i've made him some serious commission from clauses like that in the past. &gt;*steve:* ok, wait there. steve now stands a chance to make a considerable amount of commission. the client wrote the requirements, signed off the requirements, signed off the work in acceptance testing, and have only 32 hours before they launch. they will be willing to pay a significant sum to fund the overtime required from personnel to get this straight. ***the prestige:*** it's 4:45 and i am considering what i'll spend my weekend doing. boss walks out of his office and comes over to me. &gt;*boss:* can you just join me on a conference call? &gt;*me:* if it's quick. &gt;*boss:* that's up to you really. intrigued, i follow him into his office where i can hear a much more humble sounding douche on the phone, explaining to steve what needs to be done. &gt;*boss:* steve, i have derp here, do you want to explain what the plan is? &gt;*steve:* derp, we really need to get this sorted. you worked on the original feature so you'll know the best way to test this. we're still working on getting someone to develop the change but we'll be willing to pay you triple time this evening and tomorrow to work on this for sunday. we reckon we can do this patch without any impact to our other clients. &gt;*douche:* i really need you to help me out here mate, otherwise it'll really hit the fan over here. i pause and enjoy this brief moment of pure justice. &gt;*me:* i've already made plans for this weekend and... &gt;*douche:* derp, seriously, you have to help me out here. &gt;*me:* i don’t really feel like it. &gt;*douche:* well someone needs to fix this!! &gt;*boss:* it's 5pm on a friday. most staff are on their way home or out the door. sorry steve but it looks like it'll have to wait until next week. douche rages down the phone and, once this torrent of abuse subsides, steve lets me go back to my desk. i'm packing up for the end of the day and my phone rings. &gt;*me:* &lt;company&gt;, derp spea... &gt;*douche:* please, i need you to do this. &gt;*me:* you need to sort this out and calling me won't help you. &gt;*douche:* please, i'm sorry, just help me out. &gt;*me:* you have been extremely rude to me and insulted me whenever we've spoken. your failure to listen to me is the sole reason you're here right now. i did exactly what you asked and you have treated me with contempt every step of the way. i am not helping you. &gt;*douche:* please... he's actually crying. you can hear it in the way his voice is all shaky. so i hang up and leave for my weekend. **the end:** monday rolls around and steve introduces me to a new project manager for the client who's organising the fix to the api. &gt;*steve:* so, derp, this is herp. another project manager for &lt;client_name&gt;. &gt;*me:* is douche not working on this project? &gt;*herp:* douche no longer works here. tl;dr: douche pm for client writes spec for api. sproc logic makes no sense, pm thinks he's infallible. qa tech questions logic, gets reported for being insulting. client doesn't test the api, signs it off anyway. it hits the fan, release date is ruined. pm is in deep and pleads for help. qa tech hangs up and enjoys weekend even more.sorry for the triple posts everyone. i knew this would be a terribly long post, so i broke it up to make it slightly easier to read, but here is everything in 1 post. **part 1 - betrayal and planning** this is a long one, but it made me feel oh so good. in my high school, there was a counselor who just didn't like me. well to put it more accurately, he didn't like my family. his daughter and my eldest sister had been academic rivals their senior year and my sister won a state-wide award over the counselor's daughter. it didn't help that my second sister actively pissed this guy off by ignoring him and going over his head for things (she was the sbp and went out of her way to not involve him in things). which set me up for a bad time when it comes to this dude. in 10th grade(year 11, i think, is equivalent) i tried for a $10,000 dollar scholarship that came with a brand new laptop. i got teachers, staff, and coaches to be my references, wrote an essay, and sent everything in. three days before the deadline, i get a phone call from the company offering the scholarship. one of my references hasn't sent in their letter. let's have a show of hands of the times a company offering a scholarship calls someone to make sure they get their stuff in. i get on the phone to the one guy i know messed up and sure enough, he forgot to mail it out. wait patiently for the results to be announced, and when they do, i'm not one of the winners. i didn't even win 1 of the 4 minor scholarships that were for my school. the 4 kids who did win, all of them very smart people, were called out of class by counselor scumbag specifically because he wanted them to apply for the scholarship. to put this in perspective, there 5 students in my grade that everyone agreed were the "smart kids". i was one of them and i didn't get an invite. i shrugged the loss off. i really just wanted the laptop anyway. fast forward half a year. i'm taking a foreign exchange-student to the homecoming. the girl's host family was one of my reference, a nice teacher who works with the juvenile delinquents and is the adviser of the honor society (i worked with him in honor society). the girl needs a few more minutes to finish getting ready, so i sit in the living room with the teacher and shoot the bull about school. he steers the conversation towards this scholarship i missed out on. i say that that was just tough luck. he gives me a confused look and says, "so you don't know what happened?" i ask him to elaborate and he tells me a tale. about a week after the deadline for the scholarship ended, he receives a phone call from the scholarship company. the lady on the phone was very confused as to how the teacher could have written such a nice reference letter for a troubled and dangerous student like me. the teacher says that i am one of the best students he's ever worked with (a bit sappy, but his words not mine.) he then asks how the lady came to think i was such a terrible person. &lt;cue suspenseful music&gt; this lady had called the school to ask about the 5 applicants to the scholarship from our school. the first person who she talked to was counselor scumbag. he said 4 of the applicants were star students and never got in trouble. he claimed the last one (me) was a troublemaker and a terrible student. he had on several occasions had to speak to me about my actions in class. i would be a terrible candidate for the scholarship due to my aggressive and dangerous behavior. now, i'm a little bias, but i had only spoken to this counselor a handful of times. mostly it was "hello counselor." i'm not trying to make this juicier or more revenge worthy. i just never spoke to this guy when it wasn't absolutely necessary. this counselor, a person who was suppose to be there to help students just straight up character assassinated me so that i had no chance to win the scholarship. after the dance, which was lovely and the foreign student thoroughly enjoyed, i began to think about this information. this counselor didn't like me and obviously would offer no help when i started to look at colleges. i'd have to do it myself and this revelation gave me an idea. the counselor was notorious about scholarship amounts. he love to brag about how much a class was offered in scholarships. he even had a ceremony at the end of the school year to announce the cumulative amount a student got and where they had accepted to attend college. he even let the top earners say a few words in thanks for those who helped them. i resolved then and there that that would be the hour of my revenge. i would earn more scholarships that anyone else in my class, forcing the counselor to let me speak in front of my class and the faculty. i would blast this scumbag for the jerk move he pulled and let everyone know i got those scholarships by myself and with no help of our benevolent counselor. **part 2 - "am i suppose to be impressed"** now that i had decided to get revenge from this counselor, i needed to get to work on getting the scholarships. since i pulled a 31 on my act, i was able to apply to schools early and bypass the stupid pay-to-apply process that many universities have. i worked to improve my resume as best i could. my grades were around a 3.5 gpa because i wasn't interested in school, so i drove home the extra-curricular activities. i got more involved in sports, joined the scholastic bowl(quiz bowl) team, ran for student government, and did both on-stage and behind the scenes theatre. i never got elected to student government, but my teachers always nominated me for class rep. it gave me the unique opportunity to study my prey up close. counselor scumbag had a system. if you were a family friend or lived in his neighborhood, you got preferential treatment. not noticeably so if you didn't look for it, but it was in everything he did. so-and-so got a scholarship that wasn't advertised throughout the school, despite 50% of the school being eligible. awards were given to certain people despite being on equal or lesser footing than other students. this is how i found out the reason only 5 people applied for the scholarship when i was in 10th grade. it was never publicly announced in the school. i didn't notice since my family found the scholarship online. small things like this should not have happened. this counselor claimed that he would help everyone get into college if they would come to him, but he kept the best scholarships and opportunities away from the majority of the school. by the end of my junior year, i had applied to 10 universities around the us. in the next 4 months, i had another 6 applications sent out. by the time school was starting up for my senior year, i was winding down on schools that i wanted to apply to. i thought it would be a good time to move ahead with my plan. i walked into counselor scumbag's office one day and asked him if there were any scholarships he knew of that i could apply for. he had spoken with a friend of mine, one of the other 4 people who were dubbed the "smart kids". scumbag gave this guy a stack of applications to fill out about 3 inches thick. every major university for 300 miles was covered as well as many private scholarships from companies. what does scumbag give me? 2 scholarships, neither of which i could ever qualify for. thanks to genetics, i was neither female nor hispanic. i thanked him anyway and said i would apply to both. over the next 6 months i received letters of acceptance from 14 of the 16 schools (never heard back from the other 2). in total, i had be offered $516,000 over 4 years, with $136,000 from a single school. some may say i'm privilege, that i have nothing to complain about. they maybe right, or the 6 years spent working construction with my dad may have put the fear of hard labor in me. either way, i had done it. that amount surpassed any single student's cumulative scholarships by about $200,000. i was pretty proud, and then i get a note from the office asking to meet with counselor scumbag. i had written up a word document that listed all 14 scholarships with amounts and schools and brought it to school that day to show some teachers that i used as references. i chuckled to myself as the fates had decided to shine on me that afternoon. when i got down to his office, i asked what he needed. scumbag said he had two things for me. first was that he needed a list of all scholarships i had been offered for his presentation at the end of the year. second was the wonderful news. i had received a $1000 a year scholarship to school #9 on my list. he said i should be proud of such an accomplishment. i laughed in his face. "$4000 isn't even a piss in the bucket." i slide the list across his desk to him, "that is my list. $516,000 in scholarships offered from 14 different universities, including the $4000 one." he looks the sheet a couple of times, reading it in earnest. some of those schools were nearly 3000 miles away. i'm not sure if it never occurred to him that students wouldn't want to go to school within a day's drive of home. he sits back in his chair, takes a deep breath in through his nose and says, "am i suppose to be impressed?" this is where i made my mistake. i had played my hand too early, but i didn't realize it. i told him that i had earned more than anyone ever had at our school and that i was looking forward to his presentation. i picked up my bag and walked out, feeling like a king. scumbag sat at his desk, with his fingers pressed together in front of him. i was on my way to a perfect revenge. oh was i ever so wrong. **part 3 - an unexpected result** a month had past since my encounter with counselor scumbag. word had gotten around that i had earned some serious scholarships, but i kept it a secret so to have that big *gasp* moment. scumbag had not made contact with me and i was fine with that. i was winning. i had done what others had thought improbable. earning over a half a million dollars in scholarships was nothing to scoff at. with the ceremony a week away, i was assured of my victory and absolute revenge. let this be a lesson for everyone. never trust the system to play fair. the first sign of danger was that with only a week left, no one had been notified about speaking at the ceremony. i kept checking with the "smart kids" to see if they had been approached, but nothing. then the hammer fell. "the ceremony would be changed this year. in an effort to save time, we will not be having the students speak at the ceremony since they already do this at graduation. we will still present the letters of acceptance to students who were accepted to a local university." that was all the announcement said. i can still remember it now because it caused such a pit to fall in my stomach. i had the slimy bastard and he changed the rules. in 15 years of him being head counselor, the top earning students had spoken at the ceremony. and time? the ceremony was never longer than an hour, so what were they conserving it for? something had to be up. i swung by the front office to talk to the secretary. i had been an office aide for her in the past (it helped to figure out scumbag's system) and she knew most of the gossip around the school. this time, she too was clueless and couldn't figure out why a man so set in his ways would suddenly change the ceremony just a week before it occurred. as i walked back to class, i saw him out of the corner of my eye. he had just finished speaking with another counselor. he glanced my way, did a slight double take and smirked. i stopped and glared back. if there ever was a point in my educational career that i wanted to punch a faculty member, that was it. this man had used this ceremony for his purposes for years. i had seen him read off scholarships amounting to $100,000+ to one student and $2,500 to the next. this wasn't about making sure people's feelings weren't hurt. he didn't care that a student had put his time and effort into gaining more than anyone thought he could. this man wanted nothing more than to control his system. i had to force myself to walk away. (if any of you think i'm being harsh or bias, it's possible. these are the events seen through my eyes, but a little bit down i'll explain more, so hold on) the day of the ceremony arrives. my family goes and gets good seats near the aisle. happy faces are all around me, but i can't help but feel a little displeased. this was to be the stage of my grand revenge. i sighed, and thought that he would at least have to announce my scholarship of $136,000 to a university halfway across the country. counselor scumbag gets up and begins with his usual droll about how wonderful the class was through the years. he subtly hints that he had a hand in guiding these "brilliant upstarts" towards a brighter tomorrow. the usual sappy sludge dished out at events like these. scumbag begins to give out the awards. first to the students going to the local universities, then moves on the the students who have earned their nursing licenses through the hosa club (health organizations student apprenticship, or something like that), and finally he gets down to me. "arcval has accepted a scholarship to awesome university." ... ... ...if you waiting for more, that's it. after putting in hundreds of hours or applying, writing, getting references, and visiting campuses, i get "arcval has accepted a scholarship to awesome university." i can't say anything, my family is shocked that he didn't say the amount of the scholarship and that he said it almost in a hushed whisper. i just bite my lower lip and stare dead ahead. defeated, humiliated, and ashamed. not much more he can do to me now. you can't tell, but i honestly had to stop writing for a minute. i still get upset just thinking about it. the only thought that came to my mind was to confront him after the ceremony was done. i had to know why he changed everything just because i beat his system. so i did. i waited for the crowd of thankful students and parents to disperse. when it was just him and me on the stage i asked, "why?" he looked at me and said, "because you don't deserve it." i look at him for a second, and say, "well, it's a good thing you don't get to decide everything then is it." in that one sentence, he had brought back a memory that i had of my freshman year. my sister was the student body president and she wanted to have a celebration at lunch for the end of a term. most everyone was on board with the idea, but counselor scumbag wouldn't aid it (he was one of the advisors to the student government and had to give his permission before any funds could be spent). when asked why, he said, "you don't deserve it." my sister, being a hothead, gave him some choice words to think about and went to the principle and got the celebration approved. that was what i had been missing. i wanted to prove the system wrong, when i should have ignored the system. the principal was like a really good father. he'd eat in the cafeteria with students and even join in the basketball games at lunch, however you knew he would come down on you if you broke the rules. i went to his office the next day and laid out my story just as i have done for you. he gave me many of the arguments i alluded in my (side notes). after asking him to just confront the counselor about it, he said, "arcval, i care about you, but this isn't enough to go off of." i stood up, turned to walk out and said over my shoulder, "if you cared about me as much as you said you do; you would do something about this." i walked out and went to first period, 30 minutes late. now i can't vouch for this part. i only got this through hearsay and the secondhand telling by the principal's daughter, but here goes. the principal thinks about what i told him for a bit. i had been in his office a few times, but never for anything bad. true there were measures in place for bad students before they got to the principal's office. however, no bad kid had volunteered to be the mascot for the homecoming parade. no bad kid had broken up a fight between sophomore girls. no bad kid would have earned $500,000 in scholarships. something was wrong. what i wouldnt give to be a fly on the wall in counselor scumbag's office for those 20 minutes. the words were never told to me, but it was a verbal beat down that should have been remembered. the principal walked in and wanted to know why a kid who had earned 1/3rd of the entire class's scholarships, money wise, hadn't been recognized as he should have. after much backtracking and confronting, the truth came out. scumbag didn't think i should get the recognition. the principal told scumbag that if he tried anything like this again, he would have him removed from office (union contract said you couldn't fire him, but you could put him on administrative leave. the things you learn at the water cooler...). a few days later, after this has been circulated around the school a few times, the principal stops me in the hallway and says everything is taken care of. i thank him and hurry off to class thinking that is the end of it. classes finally end and graduation night rolls around. we're lucky enough that the weather cleared up and we get to walk on our football field. the principal gets up to give his sappy congratulations to the class despite a few misfits, a joke about his daughter being one of them to liven it up a bit. he then congratulates our class on being the 2nd highest earning class when it came to scholarships. over 1.5 million dollars were offered. then he says this, "1.5 million is a remarkable feat. however there is a greater one. the measure of a student is how far they are willing to go when faced with adversity. while some influences in the world push these students down, this class pushed back, and none exemplify this determination better than arcval. his efforts alone have earned him $516,000 in scholarships. a feat he did by himself without aid. let's give him a cheer for his intelligence and determination." not sure if it was tears or a bit of cotton in the air, but my eyes were misty at that point. it wasn't what i expected and i'm sure it's not what you the reader wanted. i would have loved to have the knee jerking "gotcha" moment with that counselor, but i didn't get it. instead i got the recognition for hard work and determination. if it's any consolation, my little sister was a freshman at this time. the next year that counselor offered here a chance to attend a leadership mini-camp in our state capitol. he also started posting every scholarship available on a board for everyone to look at. the principal looks in on him from time to time to keep him honest, but i think he has wised up to the fact that he should help everyone, not just his chosen few. and that's it. that's my tale of grand revenge. i planned out a huge revenge party, just to slip up near the end and ruin it. take from this what you will, but i got something better than revenge. closure. closure and the knowledge that my efforts may have helped someone down the road get a better scholarship. thanks for reading and sorry about the 3 parts mess.so driving down my parents back lane to pick up my two daughters, 20 feet from my parents driveway a truck is sitting with its flashers on sitting in the middle of the back lane, blocking the whole road. i sit for a bit waiting for her to move and the lady yells at me, "i have my flashers on, i'm going to be 10 minutes, go around the block." i would have had to pull a u-turn in a back lane, drive 500 feet, take two left turns, drive 600 feet, two more left turn 100 more feet to get into the parking spot that was now 20 feet away from me. the two ladies in the truck were unloading groceries from the back of the truck at a very cumbersome pace. so i respond "can you pull ahead 20 feet or pull into the empty driveway (yes they had a spot they could have pulled in too) to let me pass?" to which she responds "no, my flashers are on i have 10 minutes to unload." so i was having none of this nonsense so i turn my car off, put my flashers on, go to my parents, get my moms keys, reverse her car into the back lane, and put her flashers on. i now have my vehicle and my moms vehicle blocking them in. they are finishing their unloading of groceries and start to go off on me saying they will call a tow truck and so on, and several other verbal abuses, to which i respond, "my flashers are on, i'll only be 10 minutes." i moved the car 5 minutes later, the people in question were not amused. tldr - block me from going where i want, ill block you in and make you wait.if this is too petty, i apologize, and will go post over in petty. i saw a story that reminded me of this incident in this thread though, so i figured it might be ok. also, on mobile and wall of text, so again, sorry. during winter of my 9th year alive, my parents had purchased their first convertible. i remember my dad rolling into the driveway at dusk with the top down, enjoying the florida chill. my older brother (11 at the time) and i were so excited, and begged to ride in it right then, as we believed tomorrow was too far away. my parents agreed, but said to go get dressed in warm clothing. we change, come out, and they tuck a comforter around us after we had bucked in. they took us a town over to a bookstore, where we all got hot chocolate to enjoy the ride home with to make the convertible just a little more enjoyable. we come to a stoplight, and although the top is down, all the windows are up (to reduce wind flow?). that's when it happened. two eggs smacked the windows, one on the edge of the smaller back window, causing it to get on my brother a little. the two teenagers yelled out some insults, and peeled off going right. now, my father was not yet even 30, and a marine who had a short fuse. he immediately pulled out of our lane and took the same right, determined to get the punks (i know, not the wisest with children in the car). we followed them before they lost us in an apartment complex parking lot. after a couple minutes, father gives up and goes to exit said complex. while sitting at the stop sign another car pulls up at the exit no more than 3 yards away. it was none other than dickbag 1 &amp; 2. my older brother sees them before any of us. he immediately unbuckled his seat belt, stood up, and threw his hot chocolate in such a perfect throw, i don't think i'll ever see anything so beautiful again. this hot chocolately missile sailed right into the drivers window, and exploded upon impact. the dickbags immediately jumped out and yelped about it being hot, and it being everywhere. just as quickly as he had stood up, older brother sat back down and buckled up. stares of disbelief all around, father starts driving home with a faint smile on his face. i shared my hot chocolate happily. tl;dr: my older brother served revenge with a side of hot chocolate i didn't know where to post this but this seemed more pro than petty. this revenge was carried out by a friend of mine. we connected the stories months later and we couldn't believe it. it still tickles my fancy to this day so my so and i are at our local strip mall doing some shopping. this shopping plaza has a movie theater in it as well. as we were walking into the parking lot, this brand new silver scion xb (with dealer plates still) whips into the parking lot. all four windows of the scion go down and a 16 year old pops out of each one. they each were armed with squirt guns and water balloons. first target, 90 year old woman. splat, right on her walker. she is soaked to the bone. they spray anyone within distance of the car before hucking a few more balloons into the distance. the tires screeched and they were on the open road again. the whole ordeal took less than 45 seconds. the family of the old woman helps her to a bench, everyone else is fine, but pissed and wet. we got in our car and took off. months later, my friends are out at that same movie theater seeing some movie. right as the credits roll, 4 kids stand up in the front row with water guns and just start blasting the audience. they laugh and run off out the main entrance. my friend was in the second row and was sooo very pissed (and wet). she grabbed her purse and ran out the emergency exit. right when she gets to the front to the theater, she sees these kids run out and jump in a brand new silver scion xb with dealer plates. my friend is smart. she always brings a big bottle of soda to the movie theater. so she pulled out this almost full bottle of soda, ran up to the window of this scion, and just dowsed these guys with diet coke. the whole bottle emptied inside that pretty new car. she said she just threw the empty bottle on the drivers lap and said "have a good night guys" my fancy is so tickled right now. my mother was from a rough family, she was the youngest of 5. she was very volatile, mean &amp; narcissistic which meant she didn't have many friends. similarly, she was resentful &amp; got very jealous. she met my dad when she was a teenager and married him in her 20s. my dad is a lovely man, i'd say he's the opposite to my mother &amp; i guess they hit it off. my mum didn't really want kids and they hadn't discussed it. the game plan changed when my dad decided he wanted a kid. they made a baby &amp; i popped out (yay)!! my dad stayed at home to look after me and quit his job. my mum decided to go back to work. this made my dad and i really close as he looked after me (mainly) for the first few years of my life. at this point, i loved both of my parents and felt loved. when i started school, i was bullied for my looks and intelligence, many people thought me to be an idiot but after testing, it turns out that i'm dyslexic (like my dad). my parents paid a small portion for me to see a private tutor &amp; the dyslexia is managed - so much that i do a level english. my mother, however, continued to treat me like an idiot and would make comments to bring me down. she had began drinking &amp; was put in hospital when i was about 8/9. she came out a few months later &amp; stopped drinking. things were ok as she was stable and we thought things would get better. however, over the next few years, my mother became more volatile, mean and she openly told me she was jealous of me. she made comments such as " i wish i'd never had you, i wish i'd had a miscarriage" and " no one likes you" blah blah. anyway, she was a bitch. i put up with it until she started physically beating me ( i was 12) and my dad &amp; then i'd fight back in self defence. she would then go to the doctors and tell them that i was beating her up (lol) and that i needed to be put in care. arguments between my parents got worse and my dad wanted to leave her. he realised how bad she was one night when she attacked him &amp; called the police - the police took her away. she blamed this behaviour on drinking, yes, she's started again. however, when she was sober, she'd try to hug me and upon realising that i didn't want her near me, she'd get angry again. my mum died a few years ago. i can't say i miss her, she was the bane of my life. i am not a bad person but she made me feel like i was the worst person ever known to man. i understand she had her own struggles but she took them out on the people she was supposed to love the most. my revenge is subtle, she told me that i'd miss her when she was gone, but i don't miss her. i don't go to her grave, think of her on her birthday, i don't feel anything towards her but pity and disgust. it's sad but i have my dad, a loving step mum &amp; understanding friends. i have many good memory's of my childhood and i'm now a very happy person. ah, revenge is sweet.long ago, either before i was born, or shortly thereafter (i'm 20), some dumb jackass had the bright idea to tailgate my father like it will somehow make him go faster. in winter, with snow and ice everywhere. now, as i'm sure we all know, the worst possible thing you can do with that kind of shitty road condition, is to slam on your brakes. my father being the clever man that he is pressed his brake pedal enough to light up the brake lights, but not actuate the brakes. dumb jackass panics, slams on his brakes, and proceeds to spin out into the ditch. my father felt no obligation to go back and help.tl;dr at the bottom of the page. this is also a throw-away name as i don't care for it to be associated with my regular forum posting. i can't tell if i'm a bad person or not... i mulled it over, but i may be blinded by my own sense of justice. because i am the batman.. woman. whatever. i was 19, living in phoenix, and working at a restaurant while going to college. one of my managers offered to come over and assist in a school project i was stuck on. i lived alone and was a bit naive, but still allowed him in when he came over much later and had been drinking with other co-workers. without lots of details, he drugged and sexually assaulted me. the next day he lied about it at work, but he then phoned the restaurant repeatedly while he was out of town and not only admitted to it but gloated in the fact that i was "good" and it's a pity i didn't remember. oh, yeah, he was also in his early thirties, married, and had a child. i didn't phone the police because i was 19, scared, and remembered bits and pieces. i understand how women can be treated in rape cases and i chose to not pursue it. i quit that job and moved about six months later after becoming ill in what i can only assume is some kind of ptsd / nervous break down. here's the revenge part: i found him on facebook. he still lives in phoenix. i found his wife's facebook. i found his address. i created a fake profile and wrote his wife (who was pictured with "daddy" and three children) and told her every bit that happened. it was nothing graphic, as i was sincerely not trying to hurt her, but there was definitely enough detail that she would know it's true. i've never heard back from her, but i know she has seen it. she has since moved to another city in phoenix from what i can see. tl; dr -- asshole drugs and rapes me, so i find his wife years later and tell her what he did shortly after the birth of their child. eta: i really, really appreciate the feedback from everyone, even that which i may disagree with. obviously rape is a very touchy subject for many people and can be quite divisive. thank you all for the kind words and support. even though this is an anonymous internet forum, it really does mean a lot to me personally. my greatest thanks again. &lt;3okay. so i am a bouncer. proof: check the username. i've had some stories on prorevenge before, but each night i work is a new adventure and i got another good one the other weekend. so i switched my allegiance from the bar i worked at to the new bar that opened up in town because they offered me more money for my services. so i have been working there for quite a while. usually everything is pretty chill and i get to walk around, be big, hit on girls, and drink a free beer every hour or so. good stuff. well i live in a college town. and being in a college town, there are fraternities that are always at war with each other. i have no problem with fraternities, i was in one myself. and i don't care which one you're in. if you're nice to me, i'll be nice to you. well apparently my opinion wasn't too popular among these guys. well every weekend there's this one douchebag fraternity, i'll call them the snakes, who comes into the bar and tries to start fights with every single butt fucking person who looks at them the wrong way. and they have one ring-leader who we'll nickname dick. when i'm working the door, i don't let them in. but i work the floor a lot too. well the snakes are the pretty boy pussies who have to gang up on someone 5-1 to win a fight. and they still usually lose because they're such bitches. i actually punched one of these guys at a football game, but that's a different story. well the snakes roll up in the bar 15 deep, drunk as shit and looking to show their dicks. there's another fraternity who is really cool, so we'll call them the dogs. well apparently one of the dogs is dancing with a girl that dick is interested in. so the snakes see this and try to start some shit. they start pushing and eventually punches get thrown. well i get in there and break the shit up and throw a few of the snakes out, including dick. he's cussing me out the entire time and says he'll whoop my ass, and get his boys to whoop my ass and yada yada yada. so after i throw them out, i go back inside. there's some tension but nothing happens for the rest of the night. or so i thought. after we close down the bar and start cleaning up, i go outside to the front door to drink a beer and relax for a few minutes. well i walk outside and it was like fucking leonidas versus the persians. the snakes called their entire fraternity to come jump the dogs. there were about 40 or fifty snakes and about 15 dogs. since the parking lot is out of my jurisdiction and i'm not about to get stabbed over some stupid shit, i call the police and don't do a damn thing but watch. so the inevitable happens and there's a huge brawl going on in the parking lot. the dogs are beating the shit out of the snakes. there's this one dog who is fucking huge. i'm a bouncer, and i'm saying this dude was fucking huge. i watch him uppercut this motherfucker clean off of his feet, then turn around and clothesline another pussy snake. it was awesome. well this big mother fucker gets his eye sight on dick and charges at him. dick tries to get away, but alas, his drunk sperry'd feet are not quick enough. andre the giant grabs dick, punches him square in the jaw, and then picks him up over his head. he walks over to the dumpster and throws dick right in. i'm in awe at how awesome that was. well shortly after the police show up, break up the fight and arrest a few people. i go back inside to clean up. after about an hour it's my job to take out the trash. so i walk outside with this ripe bag of bar juice and vomit to the dumpster. i look inside and look who is still in the dumpster. dick, too fucked up to get out. i said "hey mother fucker, you're not gonna die are you?" he just kind of looks at me with his swollen jaw and drunk eyes and just moans what i took as a no. i said "good" and dumped all the alcohol, vomit, spit, dip, and other juices of the bar all over him. i said "i'll just leave you here with all the other trash" and i went home. it felt fantastic seeing that mother fucker who constantly started fights and made my job harder get his ass handed to him. i guess he never learned his lesson though, because dick still comes into the bar and tries to start fights. but deep down, i think he knows that he'll always be a piece of trash. tl;dr. i'm a bouncer. there was a fraternity beef going on in my bar. ring leader of douchebag fraternity gets ass whooped and thrown into a dumpster. i make sure he's not dead and dump disgusting bar trash all over him. also, titties. the backstory: this story is a few years old now, im about to graduate from college as a super-duper senior, and this story starts between junior and senior year of high school. i'm not sure, you know the saying "never stick your dick in crazy", well in high school i did not realize the seriousness of that advice. my ex, lets call her b was best friends with the girl next door. when i first met her she seemed like kind, sweet, and caring individual. we met that first night and immediately hit it off, texting back and fourth every waking moment after that point until i asked her out two weeks later. her family was pretty strict but it was understandable, i was a senior guy on the football and track team with a sports car and a fairly cocky attitude. i was also an eagle scout, and all around good guy so i managed to get in her family's good graces fairly quickly. things seemed good for a while until we got past the phase of absolute good behavior no matter what. thats when things started to go downhill. she revealed to me that she had been a "cutter" in the past but that it was no longer an issue. this it turned out was a lie. as time went on she started to ease me into the idea that she liked self harm and that i was the thing that kept her afloat every day. as a 17 year old in his first real relationship i figured that i was a pretty awesome guy and i might be able to salvage what was otherwise a bad situation, so i stuck with it thinking that things would get better. throughout my senior year it became clear that she wasn't formerly into self harm, it was still in full swing and me being the loving boyfriend i was, tried to help her through it. around march i had finally had it and tried to break up for the first time. she told me that if i did this i would be signing her death warrant as she would become suicidal. looking back this was the point that i should have called to cops. i stupidly stuck around after this, trying to bring her mental health up. it wasn't like i didn't like her, it was just that she stressed me out with her depressing bullshit. after the breakup attempt though things changed, she knew she had kept me on the hook out of sheer crazy maneuvering so she was always trying to gain the upper hand, and any time i was holding my own it became my fault that she was cutting herself (remember i was a 17 year old kid, naive to the world, and really just trying to be sweet and loving). it was around this time that she started gas lighting me, and trying to turn me against anyone that was a friend or family to me that would say she was being crazy. if she fucked up it was suddenly my fault, and the relationship immediately became much less fun. i am not proud to say that i put up with this bullshit for another year and a half, it went on entirely too long and i will admit, i fell for her brainwashing losing contact with nearly all my friends and my dad's side of the family. eventually i couldn't take it and left town to go to a different college further north in the state. after a few weeks in a new town, hanging out with my old friends and realizing that i was a pretty awesome dude in my own right, i ended it casting off her brainwashing petty bullshit once and for all. i immediately was getting 24/7 texts "i miss you" "i love you" "forever and always" which started to quickly turn to "come back" "i'm sad" and finally bottoming out around "i carved your initals into my leg" and "i took a bottle of pills". let me put this straight, i didnt and dont want her dead, i just wanted to be free from that environment. and i still cared for some reason, just not enough to stay. so i called when she told me she took a bottle of pills. and when she didnt answer i called back maybe 5 more times over the course of the next hour, trying to get in touch with her or her friends to see if she was ok. fast forward to the next day i get a call from the local sheriff from my hometown, "m, i just got out of a conversation with b and she wants to file a harassment complaint against your calls yesterday" so i explained the details to officer friendly that she was nuts, and that it was not normal behavior on my part for that to happen. he replied with "thats fine, she struck me as not normal and i tend to think given knowing you(i'm from a small town, i've met him before, even been to barbecues with mutual friends) that this isnt normal. anyway youve been asked to not contact her again" i replied that that was fine, i broke up with her trying to get away. so that was it i didn't talk to her again. the revenge: so at this point i had been away for another year and a half or so, in my time in the university i rushed a fraternity and had dated a few times, leaving b well into my past as a distant, unpleasant memory. one day i got a text from her out of nowhere. "hey its b, i just got a new job and im dancing at ______ lounge tonight, you should come". i looked up what this lounge she was dancing at was and it turns out that its a strip club, and a pretty sleezy and low budget one at that. i confronted one of my friends and pledge brothers in my fraternity, f, about the situation and what we should do about it, and together we concocted a plan. f saw me when i was with b and saw the bitchy shit she pulled, and then heard about her call to the sheriff. we got as many brothers together as we could and gave them a briefing session about what was up, "m's ex, b is working at the lounge tonight. here are pictures of her and what her outfit will be (again she sent me photos trying to lure me there). whatever you do, do not get any dances from her or tip her when she's working the pole." as word spread we got around 60 guys in the house of 80 to carpool to the lounge and fill that place more that it had been in years, and throughout the night not a single one of my brothers gave b a cent, instead getting lap dances and going to the pole whenever she wasnt there. if she was in a place trying to gain customers we would empty that area. over the course of the night i would bet we spent somewhere between 2-3 grand, and as best i could tell not a single cent spent on b the whole night. the next day i got a text from b saying "what the shit was that?! it was my first night and on the most crowded night that place has had in years nobody tipped me. the boss just fired me because of not making any cash." so i told her "you said i can't contact you again or you'd file harassment charges. i just did what you asked and never contacted you again."i then told my bro f "i think i just won". tl;dr in the end i managed to get out of an abusive as fuck relationship, get closer with 60 of my frat bros, get my ex fired from a 3rd rate strip club, and win the break up. edits for formatting and some basic changes. edit#2: shout out to /u/whiteguycash for the gold! first time gilded so thank you!so 2 weeks ago, it was the end of my school term. i was so glad that the summer was almost here. not because i got to do nothing for 6 weeks and not because school was out. the reason i was so glad was because i could now get away from a girl. a girl i shall name sophie. ever since the beginning of the school term this girl has been sexually harassing me. now you might be saying "that's a bit extreme. i doubt she's been doing anything to bad.". well... at the beginning of the term, it wasn't to bad. sophie started coming up to me to stroke my face, i ignored it and thought nothing of it. a few weeks later, she's grabbing my balls in class. i had to tell someone, so i told my parents. they thought it wasn't as bad as i was saying it was, so they did nothing about it. i went to my friends for help, they all had the same response "tell the head of house.". telling the head of house would only make things worse. she would act all innocent and say she didn't do it. but i went there anyway. i thought i needed someone to talk to about it. i've never been very confident myself, but this man has always helped me through times like this. i'll call him sir. sir realizes that i don't want him to get involved. he tells me that the only way i can deal with this is by myself. and you know what? at the moment it all came back to me. all the times she grasped places below the waist, the times where the teacher is completely oblivious, and then her friends start laughing at me. i say nothing and i leave the room. that night i research everything about her. i find her facebook, filled with selfies of herself in the mirror, wearing skimpy clothing. i don't have facebook myself, so i guess she thought i would never find her on the internet. sophie has all these posts on her page about the boys she has been touching. it's not just me. this girl has been grasping boys balls since day 1. she doesn't have any of her school friends on facebook, so i guess she thinks she can post whatever the fuck she wants and no one will find her. i take screen-caps, print them out and put them in my bag. i was ready. in comes the last day of term. i go to my first lesson. and she's sat in the seat next to me, the teacher is making no attempt to move her, so i sit down. the kids behind me are putting me down. i completely block them out of my head and focus on sophie. we start doing whatever and then sophie starts stroking the back of my head. i look at her. she has the biggest shit-eating grin i have ever seen in my life. i turn to her and say "ok, what is your problem?" she looks to the people sat behind her and acts all innocent. she says "it's just a joke.". i reply by saying "oh, was touching my balls a joke then?" the class goes silent. everyone is looking at me and sophie. i open my bag and get the print screens out. "was touching ----- a joke too?" as i slam down the paper. "and ---, ----, ------, ------, etc" as i'm saying their names, i'm slamming down the print screens. a shocked look is on her face. she tries to get her friends to back her up that it was only a joke. they burst out at her and said "oh my god, we don't even like you!". she soon realizes that all the people that were her friends didn't even want to be her friends. she is now unsure of what to do. she is looking round for support but she get's none. she turns to a kid (who i shall call john) and asks him for support. john goes up to her and says "do you know why i took those pictures? just so you could leave me the fuck alone." the class, at this point, is in a riot. it's like a fight has broken out. it turns out john had been taking naked pictures of me when i was in p.e.. sophie is crying, the whole class is telling her "that's just wrong. you can't touch someone there. etc.", the teacher is trying to break me and sophie up and then...i leave. that was 2 weeks ago. and i have no idea what to expect when i get back to school. tl;dr: girl grasps my balls in lesson, turns out she has been doing it for ages to other people, call her out in lesson, turns out she has no friends.my friend was stationed in korea at the time on a 3 yr tour (he had aiped his wife is korean) when a new warrant officer came in approx 6 months after his arrival. my friend never really cared for this officer however he dealt with it. it was a known fact within the office that this officer was married with a family back in the states. well shortly after arriving in korea the warrant officer met a young 20 yr old korean girl who he began dating. they dated quite a bit and everyone kind of turned a blind eye. this is actually illegal in the military. before i say anything, please note i married a lovely korean woman and i am very happy with her and think korean people are great. with this being said because of how korean society treats school/education young korean people generally lack the relationship maturity when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex. as an american dating at 14-15 yrs old is not uncommon. my first girlfriend/kiss was at 13 i don't think that unusual. my wife's first boyfriend/kiss was at 21 and most of her friends are right around that age group. many korean girls that i know first boyfriends/kiss came in around the age of 20-22 yrs old. which means this girls first boyfriend was this officer. she didn't have the relationship maturity/experience to see everything. not saying korean people are immature, however i just thought that point needs to be clarified. in fact they are very hard working. well it really surprised everyone, especially my friend when this officer proposed to this girl. my friend got extremely worried at this point, what was this guy doing? was he really this stupid? well he still turned a blind eye, it was time for the officer to go back home. by this time the girl had moved all of her stuff to the officers home. the officer had all of her belongings packed up and sent back to america. the officer brought the girl to the airport to get on the flight. this girl went out and got her passport, told her parents she moving to america and dropped everything in her life for this guy. who she didn't even know he was married. well they get to the airport, and its her first time at the airport. they walk around grab a coffee etc when he tells her he has to go to the bathroom. he grabs his bag and off to the bathroom. she waited for him, she waited for him for approx 30 mins before she decided to start looking for him. she spent a good 45 minutes checking for him asking around if anyone had seen him. she got airport security involved about 2 hrs later but they weren't much help. she was in tears, she of course thought the worst, something terrible had happened to the love of her life. she called my friend in tears, my friend was obviously confused. the flight had been scheduled to leave 2 hrs ago what happened. he handed the phone to his wife so she could speak korean and he saw his wifes face go from a face of concern, to confusion and then he knew... her face became angry. no angry is a nice way of saying this she fucking pissed off at this scumbag. i'm sure at this point she'd like nothing better to cut his balls off. his wife explained everything to my friend. the officer had abandoned his girlfriend/future wife at the airport. not only did he ditch this girl in the airport with the pretense of living with him forever he also took all of her stuff to america. my friend rushed off to the airport (a lengthy drive approx 3 hrs) to collect her) on the way he took the time to make a few phone calls. he had one of his soldiers even pull the officers home phone number. lets just say my friend had a very interesting conversation with the following individuals 1. commander of the officers former unit 2. commander of the officers next unit 3. his wife i'll let you assume how those conversations went suffice to say that officer was discharged from the military, and received a court martial. here is what i know what happened for a fact 1. he got divorced, (alimony/child support) 2. he got kicked out of the military, he lost his retirement (this was worth millions of dollars over the course of a lifetime) edit: grammar, and cleared up a few points.my ex and i purchased the house in which he grew up. we wanted to add a shut-off valve to the main water line inside the house so we could do some plumbing repairs to multiple items in the house. our plumber told us he could not locate the city's main shut-off valve that's usually in the front of the house and we would have to pay a ginormous amount of money to freeze the line to get the work done. not an option for us, especially since the city provides our water and they should be able to turn it off. right? so, i called the city water dept to have them shut off the water from the main city line. the plumber told us the city should be able to locate this for us. two city workers show up, i will call them beavis and butthead. b and b go out front and spend a few minutes looking for the shut-off valve cover. they don't find it. they come to my door and proceed to tell me the news and that it is my responsibility to hire someone to dig up my front yard to locate the underground shut-off valve. i asked why i should have to do it as i was always under the impression that it was the city's responsibility to have access to my water shut-off valve. i was told in no uncertain terms that women "just don't understand how water systems work and i would have to deal with it on my own". well, i'm not the smartest person in the world, but i understand the basics of how i get water from the city, i also know that if the city workers want to shift that responsibility to me, i will find a way to put the responsibility back where i truly believe it belongs. since the city can't shut off my water, i guess i can get free water forever, so why should i pay for it? one year later and i haven't paid a water bill. i finally get a call from the city comptroller asking when i plan on paying my water bill. i tell him i will gladly pay my water bill as soon as they shut off my water! you could hear the astonishment in his voice "you want us to shut off your water?" i knew i was about to pay back b and b right then. mr. comptroller was very pissed off when i told him all the details of my discussion, how b and b refused to find the shut-off and how they insulted me when they made their comment about how women just didn't understand how water stuff works, blah blah, blah. i must say he was very sympathetic, and he apologized profusely. he promised he would get to the bottom of the problem and would call me back. he did not sound too happy with the city water dept. the next day i get a call from the comptroller and he tells me that b and b would be at my house whenever i had time to see them and he had stressed to them how important it was to find the main valve. i made an appointment and sure enough b and b show up with a bobcat and some shovels and proceed to dig up the easement between the street and sidewalk, but they don't find the shut-off. so they get out their sledgehammers and start to break up two slabs of sidewalk before they finally find the shut-off valve completely buried under the sidewalk. well! when they came to the door and told me they found the shut-off, all i could do was gloat. they were all hot and sweaty and dirty, and if they hadn't been such jerks i would have offered them a nice icy beverage. by their sheepish demeanor i could tell they had been dressed down for their behavior. it was a glorious moment. within a couple of days the shut-off was moved to the easement, the sidewalk was replaced, b and b apologized, and my plumbing problems got fixed. don't tell me women don't understand plumbing...... i'm a professor at a state university for the past 17 years, and teach pre-health and pre-med students. i've many stories, both good and bad, but i've never felt the need to retaliate against a student. until one day, i met my nemesis. this student wanted to go to medical school, though they were of very middling intellect, and came off as socially inept and personally odious. i and my class stood in her way, so i had to be shoved out of the way on her route to being a healer. she figured the best way to get ahead was to be the squeaky wheel, and bitch about everything. in academia, if you complain enough about a class, we give you a high grade and send you up to the next poor bastard for you to torment. rinse and repeat. so nemesis went all out to find everything and anything to complain about: exam had 80 questions on it, syllabus said 75 questions: complaint lecture notes were released in a format that was based on pdf, but the student wanted powerpoint (hell, no): complaint missed in-class questions on quizzes, and material wasn't covered in lecture (readings, children? i assign them for my health?): complaint inappropriate language in lecture (anatomy class, . . . penis, penis, penis, but always anatomically correct): complaint i did not return her emails the same day she wrote them: complaint everything i did, said, or thought about: complaint by the end, she had escalated these issues all of the way to the top, and i got called into the dean's office. my administrators above me have worked with me for years, giving me no fear of a student "going over my head" with a complaint. but this student tried. dean: "nevermind_it'll_heal, this student has sent more than a dozen complaints to the administration." me: "just a dozen? i was betting far, far more." dean: "normally we would let this pass as this student is known for doing this, and has even involved legal counsel in previous classes. but you have somehow exceeded her previous complaint record by a factor of 3, and none of her other instructors this semester have gotten one. she has singled you out for complaints, and some arguably appear to be about you specifically targeting this student. (yeah, in clinical cases i replaced all of the patients' names with her first name, even if the patient was a guy. but her name was very common, and there were three other ones with that name in class.) so go easy, don't antagonize her. just ride it out, and be done with it." me: "thanks, dean. good talk, bro." my nemesis kept it up. i gave her a higher grade than she deserved (which i believe was the whole point as she needed the grades for med school). then i washed my proverbial hands. . . . a year later, i was assigned to be the committee head of the faculty that create group letters of recommendation for medical school applications. and she submitted the form for our committee to create her recommendation packet. students can, and should, waive the right to read these evaluations. if you are afraid of what a professor will say about you, don't ask them for a letter. my nemesis made sure to point out to the committee in a formal letter that because of problems with all of the professors that would be writing letters, she wanted to make sure their letters were appropriate and of the correct tone and content before we sent them off. therefore she would review them before approving them for inclusion in her packet. nobody wanted to drop the atom bomb on her and write a true letter as, you know, . . . lawyers. and she would see all of these letters, as would her counsel, before we sent them. so our hands were tied. but one brave souls went around and solicited her letter writers into creating sublime choruses of praise; these would be the letters you would expect to read to the nobel committee about hawking, einstein, newton, and feynman. we are talking true works of art. nobody would believe that a student with this background or mcat score could get one of these eulogy masterpieces, let alone a whole panel. and i included a note from the committee stating that the student had previously filed academic complaints against each and every professor that wrote her a letter, therefore these letters may not reflect her true academic potential. we got our ferpa lawyer to check this with a fine tooth comb, but our committee "had a duty in our committee recommendation letter to inform those reading the professors' individual recommendations if there may be a mitigating circumstance or formal action that could influence the veracity and quality of the recommendations." the student didn't have the right to see that part unless they request it later. after the letters have been sent out, unfortunately for them. so she carpet bombed the medical schools with primary applications; every md, do, and offshore school that existed got one. the cost must have been staggering, but with parents that can afford lawyers for their brat in undergrad, i am sure they footed the bill gladly to get her out of the house. within her application packet came those beautiful letters, and those three explosive paragraphs explaining that this student filed academic complaints against every letter writer, and did not waive the right to keep their letters secret. it doesn't take a genius on the admissions committee of each of these schools to read between the lines on this one, and drop that application in the trash before granting an interview. she did not get one interview. more than 30 applications, not one school invited her to continue her application process. that gets a professorial boooo-yaaaaah! and for those of you whose lives i may have saved by preventing her from becoming the most litigious and incompetent doctor imaginable, and screwing up treatment to you or your loved ones, you are most heartily welcome. had a salesman work for me who was a likable enough guy. we lived in the same town, our families knew one another and we shared a handful of mutual friends. i was good to this guy. we paid him generously, we were patient as he tried to build a clientele. we allowed unlimited leave when he had a baby and for his older kids needs too. turned out he was working for someone else, while also working for me. he was stealing information and sharing it with them about our business. i found this out after having to fire him for lying and forging a customers signature and faking a po. let him go, found out all the other stuff about his other work, sharing secrets and found lots of illicit info on him computer. while i was mad, i didn't do anything because i didn't want to think about him anymore. never spoke of him poorly around town and didn't share gossip. so i was surprised to learn he was bad mouthing me. spread lies and made up a story about why he quit. caused his kid to threaten my kid at school. my revenge was subtle...i posted in the missed connections section of craig's list a post about him, discribing an anonymous gay sex rendevious (he is married) at his home. since i knew him and his personal details, i was able to make a plausible story that after posted...received lots of responses asking if i was looking for my former employee. i said yes to over 50 emails asking for information. fast forward 3 weeks later, i heard his wife threw him out of the house. revenge...best served cold!this is a story about some revenge i orchestrated on behalf of my best friend. my best friend is an artist. she makes her living on her art, which is a pretty difficult thing to do. she also pays me to handle the day-to-day business end of things that she doesn't like to deal with. so when someone tries to screw her over, i have a vested interest in putting a stop to it. my friend's art is fairly popular online, which means it gets stolen a lot. one of the things i take care of is keeping an eye out for infringement and contacting the people who have stolen from her. i try to handle things civilly. most of the thieves honestly don't know better. they're the kind of people who think that because they 'found it on google images' it's free for anyone to use. most of the time they apologize and agree to stop once i explain to them that it is copyright infringement. a couple of months ago i came across a guy who had taken one of my friend's product designs, copied it exactly, and was now making and selling copies via instagram. unlike most of the people i deal with, this guy was actually an artist himself. he was a college student majoring in social media and minoring in product design. so you'd think he'd understand copyright and how to behave on the internet, right? nope. he gave a half-assed apology and promised not to sell the reproductions anymore. a few months later i was doing my usual google searches to hunt for art thieves when i came across the same guy. he was no longer selling the design, but he had added photos of it to his digital resume, his linkedin, and his profile on behance (a website where artists and designers go to show off and get jobs). now this guy has a huge social media presence (as you'd expect from someone with a degree in social media). he has an account with every social media website in existence (and about fifty i've never heard of). the guy is obviously using social media and networking to land his first big job since he graduated in may. and he's using my friend's art and claiming it as his own in order to get hired! potential employers are going to hire him based on a product design that he stole! now at this point, i'm pissed. i've given him a chance to do the right thing. he knows that he's in the wrong here. he's been caught, and instead of apologizing and moving on, he's posted my friend's work all over the internet claiming it as it's own. i can tell from the date on the posts that he uploaded all these images after we talked to him and informed him that he was infringing on her copyright. that's when i decided to hit him where it hurt. right now there is nothing more important to this guy than his name. so i wrote up a blog post with the guy's name and a long documentation of his theft (including all the photos). the post spread like wildfire, and within just a few hours the search results for the guys name lead to my post. my post is currently the 8th result when you search the guys name. **tl:dr - you steal my friend's art for your resume, i make sure all your potential employers know what kind of person you are.** some back story here: i'm a handyman on the weekends to get me out of the office and feeling like i'm actually producing something -- picture a compromise of "office space". i've been doing handyman work for about fifteen years on and off, and i'm really good at it. so i get a client who lives in chicago and wants me to do some handyman work at some vacation rentals he owns in hawaii (all four are neglected and, while they look nice, they need some real work). i agree, get a retainer and a service contract signed, and get to work. i usually do about 3-4 hours of handyman work each weekend, but this guy starts giving me work to do in the vicinity of 12 - 18 hours per weekend. and not handyman work, but errands and assistant work (drop off keys, put out and take in garbage cans, etc.). this is not what i signed up for, but he's paying me, so whatever. i figure i'll get his properties up to par within a few months at this rate and then it will be a simple hour or two a weekend to maintain. unfortunately, his retainer runs out in about a month, so i send of an invoice and a request for more funds (i like to keep a little buffer in case my client tries to not pay me), and for the next two weeks i keep getting shitty answers. one day he says he wrote the check, the next week he says he finally sent it, a few days later he says he wired it to my account, etc. after a month of this i'm fed up. i sent him a final invoice for all the work with the notification that all work will cease until payment and a full retainer are paid, as stipulated in the contract. a few days go by, and i get payment for les than have the invoiced amount, as well as an edited invoice. he feels he shouldn't have to pay for a bunch of the stuff because he could do it if he lived here. fine. i re-edit the invoice, noting a bunch of stuff as "paid" and the remainder as "unpaid -- will return materials or return to original condition unless payment is made". all of the items under this heading are small, such as door locks, cable wires, curcuit breakers, etc. no word back after a week. second notice sent. no word back. final notice sent. he finally sends back that he paid what he was going to pay. i'm normally a very nice guy. if he had said that he was low on funds and maybe do a trade or help a guy out -- no problem. but treat me like what i do isn't valuable, and we have a problem. sooooo, i go buy a $5 tube of superglue, head up to the house, and get to work. superglue in the locks of the sliding doors, keeping them locked (they lead to an amazing lanai overlooking the beach), superglue the front door locks, keeping them unlockable. superglue the window hardware to lock them closed. one or two dabs on each fan i repaired, a few switches (kitchen living room, bedroom -- leave the hallway and closet lights working), a few circuit breakers in the off position, and finally the cable for internet. i made sure it was only things i had repaired or fixed, but after 30 minutes, this place was essentially an unlivable sauna of stone-age hell. five dollars well spent.my parents run a tow truck company. they often are tasked with towing and impounding vehicles on behalf of the police, most often when drunk drivers are caught and found unfit to drive. his business is in a part of the world (bc, canada) where rules against drunk drivers can be absolutely crushing - licenses can be suspended, breathalysers can be required, 30 day impounds may be required, etc. so we get a police job to go pick up a ford escape and impound it for 30 days. fees for this type of thing can go as high as $1000, depending on where it was towed from. 30 days after, the drunk driver shows up to pick up his suv. when he realizes that he owes a lot of money for the towing and storage of the car, not to mention his fines and penalties from the police and insurance, he flips out, punches my dad in the face, and runs out of the lot, driving away with the guy who drove him there. the vehicle is left in the yard. police are called, it's all on security cameras, and a warrant is issued for his arrest. nothing happens, the police don't find the guy, and his bill keeps going up for every day it sits. he has a guy claiming to be a lawyer phone in every few days, but "your client has to be here, in person, for us to release his vehicle". for obvious reasons (arrest, mainly) that guy isn't showing up. so, the company proceeds to make a claim for the vehicle. dad drives into the city, does that, and visits the courthouse to take care of another issue when, low and behold, his assailant just so happens to be there. dad calls the police, and the courtroom sheriff promptly arrests him (with my dad standing beside him). dad, laughing all the way, casually strikes up a conversation with the sheriff about a "pretty nice ford escape i just got for a cheap price". the guy hasn't been sentenced yet, but he does have a history with the police. why he'd accompany someone to a courthouse when there was a warrant for his arrest, i'll never know - i'm going to assume because he's not a smart man.one day last summer i was out and about running some errands when a small car randomly cut me off in a parking lot. the driver was on his cell phone and clearly not paying attention. over the course of the next little distance he proceeded to cut me off several more times. unsure if this guy was genuinely clueless because of the cell phone being held to his ear or if he had some random vendetta against me, i decided to put some distance between us. unfortunately, at the next intersection we were both stopped at the red light. the second the red light turned green i heard a honk. okay, i didn't leave the line as if it were a quarter mile drag, but i wasn't taking any longer then the average driver. then a second honk, and i looked in my rear view mirror and this guy is giving me the finger. being a little pissed at this guys not-so-stellar driving i decided to throw my truck in park and go confront him. it was a stupid idea for so many reasons, but sometimes my lack of fear makes me do stupid things. i get back to his window and simply ask if there is a problem. he puts his phone on his lap and then goes on a rant about how shitty of a driver i am and that i didn't move once the light turned green. i asked if he wanted to start over in a more polite way. he told me to fuck off, then picked his phone back up and i shit you not he said: "sorry mom, some asshole is blocking the road". i ripped the phone out of his hand and began walking back to my truck. he hopped out and began to charge at me but stopped the moment he realized i was not fucking around and ready to fight back. he then asked for his phone back in a decently polite way. i told him "sure, as long as you can catch". i launched his iphone straight up into the air as high as i could. he managed to stumble and miss catching his phone by mere inches. it smashed into a million little pieces. i immediately felt bad, not for breaking his phone - that felt great. i felt bad that i was probably going to get in shit by the police and have to deal with that. i don't mind a minor thing like that going on my record, it is perfectly spotless otherwise. so i decided to go straight to the police in hopes that i could reduce problems by immediately turning myself in. at the station, the other driver arrived shortly after me - i assume it took him a little bit of time to pick up the pieces of his phone. the police spoke to us separately. he was first and it took about 15 minutes. then the cop came in to speak to me. he said: "i have issued him two tickets, one for distracted driving (cellphones are banned while driving) and one for reckless driving. he has had three complaints and written warnings for other similar situations where he was on his cell phone and nearly caused accidents so i don't believe him when he tells me he wasn't on his cell phone. as for you, you shouldn't break peoples cell phones or even confront them no matter how bad their driving is. report them to us and we will deal with it. on a personal level, i bet that felt good. have a good day and remember not to get into any of these altercations." i laughed at the outcome of that. i walked outside and seen the other driver pulling out of the lot. i gave him the most smug smile and wave i could muster up. **tl'dr**: bad drivers cuts me off several times. when i confront him he verbally attacks me. i smashed his phone. police sympathized with me and gave the other driver two tickets.soo... some dude stole my brand new iphone 5s 64gb out of my hands at starbucks. when he was running out the door he was hit by a ambulance! he kept running, but he dropped his phone. i have his phone, pictures of him, his facebook page, his boss's number, his position at his job, naked picture of some chick thats not his girlfriend etc... my phone is now in lost mode and i see where it is on the map, the police are informed, our insurance will cover it and again, i have his phone with all his contacts, including his boss and girlfriend. should i let it go and take my insurance check or take my insurance check and ruin this guy's life? ruin his life you say? looks like this jerk stole the wrong guy's iphone. thanks! my sophomore year in high school, i wrestled against a girl. didn't have a problem with it until i discovered that she was a cheating, dirty bitch. she had long finger nails and kept jabbing me in the side. i wasn't sure if she was doing it intentionally until after i reversed her when she scratched my arm from elbow to wrist. she grabbed my arm, dug her nails in, and dragged her nails down to my hand. without a doubt i knew she was trying to scratch me. i pointed this out to the ref after the first period, and she said it was an accident. i pointed out the red marks on my ribs under my singlet where she had been jabbing me, but he just waived it off and ignored my complaints. so in the second period, she was on bottom and i was on top and my back was to the ref, so his vision was blocked. i quickly gave her two quick rabbit punches in the face. i don't care that she was a girl. if you intentionally play unfair, then you have to face some consequences. she had probably been getting away with that shit because she was a girl up until then. after i decked her, she finished the rest of the match fairly. she didn't even bother trying to complain to the ref about how i put her back in check.about 15 years ago, i had a horrible boss. this guy was an asshole, and liked it. it went beyond being demanding or easy to anger. he actually took pleasure in trying to humiliate and belittle everyone in every single conversation he had with them. he was a director, and let it go to his head. this guy would demand you do something, and when you did it, demand to know who told you to do it. and when you said it was him, he would smile and threaten your job. i avoided him as best i could. however, at one point a posting in another state opened up and i wanted the job. i asked for, and was given said posting. i was told to be in that state in two weeks. i broke the lease on my apartment and paid the difference. my wife quit her job. we went out there on our own dime and found a place to live. two days before we were set to move, i get the call. it's the asshole boss. "don't bother going out there, i have decided to eliminate the posting.". i was livid. my life was totally interrupted, and when i complained i was told i had an attitude problem. i stewed for a few days, but then found a position at another company in the state i wanted to be in, and moved out there anyway. i came to find out that eventually, this asshole director took another job at the competition. all went well for awhile, but then he got greedy and began negotiations with yet another company...using his corporate email address. like a fucking idiot. they obviously found out, and fired his ass. but the icing on the cake was that the other company he was talking with never gave him the job after all...so there he was, jobless. this was pleasure enough for me. total schadenfreude. through a friend who knows the asshole, i found out that he never seemed to get a job after that. 6 months went by..then 12...then 18...then 2 years...then 4 years...he got poorer and poorer. his hot wife left him and took his children with her. he was sleeping in an empty house, which was eventually foreclosed and he got kicked out of it. at this point, things get fuzzy because even my friend didn't know where he was. he may have been in the street. he may have moved in with his aging mother. meanwhile, my own career had been on an upward arc, and i was climbing higher up that corporate ladder. it wasn't long before his resume ended up on my desk. it's a small industry. normally, i would have tossed out his application because everyone and their mother in this biz knew he was caught courting the competition on the company dime. his reputation as a total ass was well known. and the job he applied for was low level. i mean, 10 bucks an hour low level grunt work. he was a former director at 6 figures, and now was willing to work shitty work at a shitty wage just to feed himself. anyone would have considered him overqualified, including me. but i had to have him in my office. i wanted to see him on the other side of my desk, asking me for bread crumbs like a common street beggar. i wanted to see this asshole, who nearly ruined my and a dozen others lives and laughed at it, groveling for a job at my fucking feet. so of course i scheduled an interview. i was going to waste his time like he wasted mine. it was one of the most pleasurable experiences i have ever had. he pretended not to recognize me, but i could see that he did. he had gotten skinnier and reeked of despiration. he had no idea that i knew the whole story, so he lied to me about the whole reason he was out of work and when i told him exactly why, he looked defeated. i told him i had no place for a liar, let alone an asshole and when he tried to shake my hand at the end of the "interview" i refused and asked him to leave. there is an old saying: "you see the same people on the way down as on the way up"last weekend i attended the beer fest in edmonton, ab, canada. the whole thing seemed like it was laid out and planned by a 12 year old, with a lot of bottle necks, dead ends and zero gathering areas. so because of this, it was pretty slow to walk around the whole place. my husband and i didn't mind, we would just grab 2 samples from each stand we went to so we would never go thirsty between vendors. there was one girl however that felt the need to get somewhere as quickly as she could. my husband and i had just picked up our latest beer samples and began walking towards where the rest of our friends were standing. there was a long line of people in front of us trying as well, to get to the other side of the venue. it was slow as you had to stop every 2 seconds to avoid spilling beer on some one or disrupting small groups trying to hold conversations but everyone was polite and would move out of your way as quickly as they could. so we're on our way, my husband leading the way, but there's a woman behind me with her cell phone literally on my back texting away who keeps bumping into me since she's not paying attention. we had to stop at the corner where there was a massive bottle neck, she ran directly into me and then i hear her say "this isn't going to work for me" and proceeds to push my arm, trying to bulldoze past me which in turn causes me to spill some of my beer on my husbands arm and my forearm. upon seeing this the woman behind me turns to her boyfriend and laughs then again proceeds to try to push past us. revenge mode kicks in, and all i can think of is the dose of instant karma this cunt needs. so with my beer still in my hand, i quickly turn towards her at the same time she is trying to push past us, my arm hits hers which proceeds to fling the entire contents of my beer cup all over her chest and face. of course i apologize immensely as she stands there in disbelief. she slinks away in one direction as i turn back and get another beer from the closest vendor. victory is mine and the next beer tasted delicious! tl;dr - girl at beer fest thinks she is important enough to push me from behind so i "clumsily" spill my entire beer all over her chest and face.i'm cross-posting this here after some people suggested i do so, through both pm's and not-so-subtle hints in the comments. so i started working in a photo lab for a popular store a few years ago, and i was trained by a girl who had worked there for about six years. i honestly think she was bipolar or something. some days, she would be super sweet to me and other days she would rip my head off for the most minor stuff ("omg strangelovenebula, you put a fucking marker in the pen drawer??!! heads are gonna roll!") she always made me really nervous that i was fucking up my job, constantly complained about everything i did, and was just a really crazy bitch to everyone that worked there. one time, she freaked out and told me that dozens of customers had lodged complaints about me (she never specified about what). when i asked my store manager, he had no idea what she was talking about. she was just nuts and i think she enjoyed trying to make me feel bad (which is tough, since i'm pretty easy-going). anyways, at the end of the night, i would have to remove this film rack out of the film processor and put it in a bowl of water (to keep the rollers from drying out). in the morning, when she would open, she would take it down from the shelf by the sink and put it back in the film processor for the day. in my own form of petty revenge, i began to fill the bowl each night exactly to the brim, then i would set it on the very edge of the top shelf (which was juuuust out of her reach). in the mornings, she would have to stand on tiptoe to get it down, and inevitably the water would slosh down on her as she fumbled with the bowl. she bitched at me in passing a few times, but i kept it up. she started hanging up signs that said not to fill the bowl all the way, or not to put it on the top shelf, but i ignored these and would cackle to myself a little each night as i did this. she got more and more pissed off, trying to complain to my store manager (he pretty much ignored everything she said, because it was well-known that she was a crazy drama queen that tried to get everyone in trouble for something or other). anyways, i guess i cracked her because one day she was trying to complain to him about it and he wasn't really listening and refused to write me up for something so silly. she ended up throwing a notebook at him as hard as she could, and he fired her on the spot. he promoted me to her job (head photo) and i got a fifty-cent an hour raise. it's such a petty revenge, but i really got a kick out of hearing other coworkers tell me how she would storm out of the lab in a huff with water dripping down her face and a damp shirt every morning. a few times it really just toppled down and soaked her completely. it warms the cockles of my heart. “dripping water hollows out stone, not through force but through persistence.” ― ovidthe person who had my number before me was mexican girl. her boyfriend is moocher. they lived together he had her put everything except his cell phone in her name as his history with the utilities was bad. mg catches him cheating on her. does she confront him? does she get in a fight with with him? nope. she just moved out. remember how i said everything is in her name? mg tells landlord she is moving out. no, no one else lives there. landlord did not know about boyfriend. mg tells electric company to shut off the power. no one is living there. mg tells cable company to end service. no one is living there. mg tells water company to shut off water. no one is living there. mg tells phone company to shut off land line. no one is living there. mg tells mutual friends he moved out and does not care where he is living. mg has her mail forwarded to new address. no one is living at old address. so he is sitting in the dark, unable to leave because landlord changed the locks. he can't take a shower as there is no water. can't watch tv due to no power or cable. how do i know all this? he called her and left several long messages complaining about it. and since the number is now mine... tl:dr moocher cheats and becomes homeless and powerless. edit fixed section on lock changing.the mods on /r/pettyrevenge removed this without telling me, so i guess i'll try here. i used to work at an expensive consultancy with a boss (the owner) who fired me for being gay. this was illegal here already, but i was paid so poorly that i couldn't afford a lawyer to sue him. however, he hadn't thought to check with his biggest client before getting rid of me, and they made him hire me back. because i unfortunately needed the money and jobs were scarce here at the time, i took it. in addition to my part time consulting duties, i was also responsible for booking all the consultants' gigs and their travel arrangements. and while the owner was the owner, he also did occasional consulting. all consulting was on-site travel to the client, and we had clients all over the country. so, whenever a client called and asked for a consultant - which was often - i'd just check the owner's calendar and if i hadn't already booked him for that week, i'd do so. preferably as far away as possible. i'd ship him out on sunday, and fly him home on saturday. he'd come home saturday afternoon, jetlagged, he'd have just barely a day to recover and see his family, and then he'd have to leave for the airport to fly out for the next gig. the clients were thrilled - they thought he was the best man we had. (he wasn't, but they thought he was.) he couldn't complain, partly because it made him a lot of money, and partly because i made sure he was never there to complain. also, he was a weird guy who insisted on micro-managing my computer programming work to the point that before he'd leave he'd tell me "don't do anything on that until i get back" and he meant it - if i did any work on my work while he was away he'd be irate, but if i sat on my ass until his return he'd be fine with it. so, he told me "don't do anything on that until i get back" thinking he'd be back the next week... and i kept him away for about four months. during which time i booked the consultants and serviced my one client (which all added up to working about one to two days a week) and then sat in my office and read novels. (this was pre-web.) and he had to pay me for it. as i said, this went on for about four months, until his very-pregnant wife appeared in my office one day, loomed over me, and in a very quiet voice informed me that she would like her husband back. recognizing this for the quite severe threat it was, i took pity on her and changed some bookings so he could come home. i let him stay home for the birth of his child, and for exactly the amount of paternity leave he said he'd be taking, and then i sent him away again. (note: i had no intention of making him miss the birth of his child, but his wife wanted him home a bit earlier than i'd planned, so i played it her way. i liked her, despite her husband.) *do not* discriminate against me and then put me in charge of your schedule, unless you want to be away from your wife for months and exhausted all the time.not sure if this should be posted here, it is a little more dramatic than most stories you might see here, and im not sure if it counts as "pro revenge". tl;dr at the bottom a bit of backstory first: a long time ago when i lived with my family, i was a handful to deal with, i was diagnosed adhd, getting into fights all the time, and had severe anger issues. my mother, and sister had no idea how to deal with me. not going to deny, i was a shit of a kid. i also happened to be the smartest in my family (besides my stepfather who didn't live with us) when it came to the subject of computers. so i was the go to guy when it came to computers, for my friends and for my family. my family are actually the most computer illiterate people i've ever met. in any case, when i started coming into my teens, i became less of a shit, learned to control my anger a lot more, and didn't get into fights as much. i really really was trying to change my ways. i also had a secret that i was hiding from my family, and that was that i was gay. when i was 15-16, i came out of the closet to my family. cue homophobic insults for the next two years. my mother and sister showed no restraint, especially when near eachother. (one on their own was usually fine, though my sister would make passing comments like calling me disgusting). i often hid in my room away from them, but they would bang on my door, calling me slurs, my mother would frequently remind me how she was going to disown me and didn't care where i ended up. this often brought me to tears, and as a result, i felt myself becoming a very angry and depressed person. when i was 18, my mother kicked me out of home. over the next year after becoming independant i began to realize the struggles my mother faced as a single mother, especially with me. the struggles of dealing with my violent stepfather who ended up winning custody of my younger sister. i concluded that her reaction to be coming out was probably some form of revenge, but ultimately found out that she just disagreed with it. (though she does hold a lot of resentment towards how i acted when i was a kid) over the next 3 years i tried getting in contact with them on and off, just to sit down and talk aside our differences, but coming from a family from sydney west, talking civilly is not my families strong suit. every attempt, the usual insults were thrown back at me, "unnatural" this "i will never accept your choice!" that, from both my mother and sister. this went on for three years, i had given up on them at this point. now during those three years, my sister had a kid of her own, and my mother and stepfather finally ended their "tolerance" of one another. as such, my stepfather was no longer fixing my mothers computer. so on the fourth year (2013), guess who suddenly is interested in speaking to her daughter again? my mother would call me asking about her smartphone, and her computers, and whatnot every so often. i was annoyed by it, but i figured this might be an opportunity to at least open the doors to us being able to be civil with one another, so i helped her just to see where it would go. i would travel two hours out, help her, fix her stuff, and leave. i eventually installed logmein on her computer in order to curb the travelling it would take me. every so often i would mention to her "mum, i'm your daughter as well you know, not just your technician" her responses to that were generally just dismissive and then nothing would change. over the course of 6 months, she would continue to call me asking for computer/phone help, and i would oblige. but i would occasionally mention the above to her again. skip forward, i find out that my mother has cancer and has basically told every family member except me. i confronted her about it, she seemed very nonchalant about it, as if it was normal for me not to be told stuff like this. a few months ago, i sent her a long message detailing why i can no longer help her because it was giving me false hope, which was ignored but "seen", until i pressed the matter. her response was telling me i deserved to be kicked out, that i made her life more stressful than the cancer ever did, and that i'm a freak who she will never accept. she said she will never seek mediation with me because i am apparently the one who is unwell, and so she shouldnt have to. i blocked her on facebook and deleted her number. at this point, i felt like i had chased them enough feeling guilty, and that i'm done trying to make up for it. **--backstory over--** **--the revenge--** skip forward a few weeks, my sister messages me for help. her computer screen is broken and she is worried about her sons photos. **me:** hey, who is this? (i had deleted her number, so i didn't know it was her initially **her** it's **[sister]** my computer scren is brokn &amp; im jus wonderin if i can get my fotos off **me:** you know i'm sick of this computer shit right? fuck off. **her:** righto mate, all i wantd ws 2 no if i culd get my sons fotos off! eat a fat one! **me:** you'll put on a friendly face when you need my help, but the moment i decline, you show me what you truly think of me. reverting to an angry demeanor and flinging what you know to be hurtful insults. hopefully you can work on that in years to come so your son doesn't pick up this trait of yours and become a bully. **her:** fuck off gronk!! im trying to figure out how to save every single foto i own of him since birth so dont u dare comment on my "angry demeanor"!! all i wanted to know is if there was a way!! **me:** my going rate is $22 an hour **her:** fuck off! **me:**tell me, why should i care? i don't know your son, i don't know you. you're just this jackass who hurls insults at me every now and again. oh, and between insults you ask me for help. that's who you have been to me for the last 4 years. that got rid of her, and then two days ago my mother messages me basically saying she thinks shes being hacked. **mum:** i don't think it was a good idea to leave log me in enabled like you suggested. someone got into my computer **me:** don't care. it's no longer my problem i didn't care. i could've easily helped both of them, could have reassured my mother, gotten my sisters photos off, but after all of that, fuck those guys. **tl;dr** family treat me like shit for the better part of a decade for being gay, decide to pretend it never happens when they want my help with computer related stuff. i help them for a bit. mum has cancer and tells everyone but me. i tell her i can't help her anymore. she lashes out at me, but asks me for help months later because shes being hacked. i decline helping her. sister also asks for help recovering her sons photos from her failing computer, i also decline helping her. end edit: added a bit more to phone dialogueso, i was the odd kid who moved into the neighborhood. got messed with a bit, but had a lot of friends so things were pretty cool. this would have been in 69 or so. my mom died in 71, and we moved away for a couple of years. i came back in 74 i think. so there was this kid in the neighborhood, who was just the worst kind of kid. ginger, scrappy, freckled, three older brothers who tormented the hell out of him, and he was the local bully/idiot, and i was his target that year. now i had been pretty reserved before, but having my mom die, moving three times in 4 years, and being kind of lost...well i was just a good target. this ass had been picking on me most of the year. little crap, pushing, shoving, knocking my stuff out of my hands. i just took it like an idiot. i'd tear up, and man that would make his day. i hated that kid, with a searing heat. we're getting off the bus one day, and asshat is behind me. as i begin my first step down the bus stairs he puts his foot into my back and just shoves me out of the door of the bus. i fly out and land on my face with my arms and legs splayed in the dirt. i'll bet it was absolutely hilarious to see, as everybody burst into laughter. asshat is there pointing and leading the laughter. i push myself to my feet and in the same motion bring my right arm up and over my shoulder in a rapidly descending arc. at the end of my lever is my six million dollar man lunch pail with the matching thermos. said arc is interrupted by asshats skull. the sound of the metal bending and the glass in the thermos breaking are forever embedded in my memory. i left him twitching in the dirt. the bus driver looked at me, closed the door and drove off. when i got home i put my lunch box on the counter and got myself some milk and ovaltine. my dad asked what happened to my lunch box. i told him i broke it hitting asshat in the head. never got messed with again in that neighborhood. tl/dr bully messes with me. i crush his head with a lunch pail.i'm handicapped. you can't see it by looking at me, unless you are an mri machine. the people who hand out handicapped tags recognize my disability. i live in an area that on one end is middle class and on the other end is really, really wealthy. my family, in laws, and all of my doctors are on the wealthy end. there is no shortage of benzes, bmws and even the occasional hummer taking up handicapped spaces. you sort of get used to it. enter real estate bitch (reb). she is the worst kind - a repeat offender. reb drives a little benz convertible. i know she's in real estate because her license plate frame lists her name, agency, and phone number, and it's framing a vanity plate with her first name on it. and i know she's a bitch because every time i go to see my neurologist, pt, acupuncturist, radiology center, and ms clinic (all in the same place, above a chic shopping center) she's in a handicapped space (the other 2 have handicapped tagged cars in them). i collectively go to these doctors at least once a week, sometimes more. i don't know why she started coming to the offices/shopping center, but she's a problem. i got her ticketed twice. no change. i call her office, first politely, then rudely. i leave messages for her boss. nothing. the center's management was in the process of adding a new bank of handicapped spaces, so all they did was tell me to be patient. one day, i'm in to see the neurologist. things aren't good. my medicine has stopped working, there is new damage to my brain. i'm depressed, coping with these new symptoms, and i felt like horseshit. and she was in the space. i snapped. i dumped my purse/diaperbag out onto the hood of my car, desperate for anything to non-permanently deface that shining mercedes and ruin her day. i snapped pens open and dripped the ink over her windshield wipers. i wasted a damn good lipstick writing 'handicapped spaces aren't for cunts like you' on the windshield (and that lipstick would really stay on there.) i opened up jars of baby food and painted the windows, making sure to line the crack at the bottom so when she rolled them down, it would fall in. and then i remembered - i had a dirty diaper. i can't dispose those in my mom's trash cans, (mom's hoity-toity these days), so if i have to change my son when i drop him off for babysitting, i just stick it in a plastic bag and throw it away 5 minutes later when i'm at the shopping center. it almost never happens. actually, it had never happened before, i was just improvising that day when it did. i tore that bag open, opened the diaper, and smeared every door handle, the grill of her car, her side mirrors, and that fucking vanity plate and the frame around it. i knew i was walking into bad news at this doctor's visit, but i was riding high. you couldn't have sunk my spirits with a lead weight. i never saw her car in one of the spaces again. edit: thank you all for your kind thoughts and concern. i am doing well, my ms isn't too bad, i just get pissy when i get bad news. then i snap out of it. i have relapsing remitting ms (rrms) which means my symptoms and their severity come and go. it will be really horrible for two weeks and then pretty manageable for the rest of the year. i have the handicapped tag because the one symptom that sticks around is fatigue, and walking from the back of a large parking lot doesn't help. this situation happened 18-24 months ago (my memory is foggy because i have a 3 year old, parenting does that to you), and i have yet to face legal consequences. i was too enraged to be sneaky about it, so i'm sure somebody saw me, but nobody did anything about it. score one for me! edit 2: i do get revenge on one time offenders in other ways. at a grocery store? i'll leave my empty cart right next to the driver side door and make you go put it with the other carts. do i have a pen and paper on hand? you'll get a massive guilt trip tucked under your windshield wiper. parked like an asshole in the handicapped access aisle? i'll try to park on the left of your vehicle, close enough that it's a really tight squeeze to get in. this time we were providing pa and backline for an african tour. we had a run of a few shows every couple of days. they started off ok, i have a million 'promoter fail' type stories, although not all of them would be suitable for prorevenge. typical african musicians though wanting to soundcheck for 5hours before performing for another 5hours... these are long days, also the level of professionalism that we are all used to goes out the window when you are dealing with inexperienced promoters and label reps who are new to this country and the near clinical way in which we operate. we run things like a military operation. if you think that every gig is run by stoned out roadies who sit watching spinal tap every day on the tourbus, you are mostly mistaken. like i said, we run things strictly on time and we follow safety procedures and everyone on the crew is professional. we struggle when people expect us to lower our standards to theirs. so anyway, we did some shows and the rule for this tour, due to the volatile nature of the events (people in the audience like to stab and kill each other every show so there's a risk of police shutdowns every show). we decide to employ the tactic of payment for the following show at the end of the night. in other words, on show1 we got paid for that show and also the next show2. we turn up for show2 and also get paid for show3 etc... we are at show4 and at the end of the night we couldn't find the promoter, it's a thursday and the next show is in london on the saturday night. no stress, we load out of the venue and i drop a text to the promoter. **me:** "hey, missed you tonight. can you arrange to bank transfer the payment over to me for saturdays show?" no response that night, he must be tired and gone to bed. next day (friday) he calls me up and says he will wire me the money asap. i tell him that i won't be departing for london until 10am on saturday morning (it's a 3hour drive from me), he has until then to transfer me the money or i will assume the show is cancelled. me and the rest of the team agree to call each other around 10am to check if the gig is on... next day, saturday, at 10am i check the bank. no funds, no expectant funds, nothing...zip! we all switch our phones off and have a day out with our respective friends and families. a nice day off! around 4pm, i decide to switch my phone on, i'm coming out of the cinema with my girlfriends. my phone beeps, i glance at the screen. 25missed calls, a dozen answer phone messages and texts from the promoter. just as i'm about to laugh out loud, the phone rings. its the promoter... **promoter:** "hey, so.... ummmm.... where are you?" **me:** "i'm just outside the cinema, on the way to nandos" **promoter:** [laughs nervously] "errr... you do know there's a show tonight right?" **me:** "errrr.... no there's not" i reply, quite reassuringly! **promoter:** "what do you mean? i'm at the venue now with the band. where are you?" **me:** "i'm on my way to nandos for dinner, im 150miles away. the backline and pa is in a truck a further 25miles away. all the crew are having a day off, like i said there is no show tonight". remember how i said we were supplying pa and **backline?** the musicians were stood around onstage with no drums, no keyboards, no amps, no pa system, no techs... not even a cable! the promoter starts stressing big time on the phone to me, pleading with me to rescue the show. i ask him what time the doors are. he says 7:30pm **me:** "ok look, here's the thing. it 'll take me an hour to get to the truck, it's a 3 hour drive to london, it'll take another hour to load in, and another 2hours to setup for your show. it's 4pm now so that means we won't be ready to go for another 10 hours!" **promoter:** "you mean 7 hours?" **me:** "no, because by the time you have personally driven up here to pay me my money before i set off, that's going to be another 3hours, which makes 10". **promoter:** [shellshocked] "oooohhhhhhhh noooooooo" suddenly realising he has fucked up and will have to refund the entire show. i might sound harsh but this promoter has repeatedly tried to screw me and many of my colleagues over many times over the years. he plays up to his 'cheeky little geezer type character. his boss, the head honcho was not happy with him. we turned up for the tuesday show because we got paid in advance on the monday. after tuesday's show we were paid in full for the rest of the tour... a further 10 shows! in 1996 i was working at a vets office in high point nc, during my lunch break i would drive down the road about half a mile to a game store beside an office depot to see what was available. leaving the game store i saw a guy in a 1997 forest green bmw with dealer plates pull in on my drivers side slightly angled blocking me in. i asked the guy if he could move his car a bit so i could pull out and he said that my piece of shit should be in a junkyard, not on the road i was driving a 1968 ford galaxie fastback with a 428 super cobra jet, and 671 weiand supercharger not a piece of shit by any means. i attempt to pull out a few times but since im driving a land yacht its not happening. getting more and more pissed off i decided hell with this guy, cut my wheel hard right and just back out normally the front bumper of my car hits right in front of the passenger door and proceeds to tear off the front door, rear door and rear quarter panel as i'm backing out. i got out of there as quickly and possible and went back to work. for about 6 months i was worried that one day the cops would show up at my door for the hit and run but they never did.my friends and i have all been frequenting this neighborhood bar for the past year or so. it's popular, usually fairly busy, and cheap enough. so, as most bars go, it has "the one guy" named brian; the tool thats there every single night you go and you feel like he's there on all the nights you don't go to, wearing one of the same 3 outfits he owns that all feature a fedora, and cramming the jukebox full of out of place and obtrusive heavy metal. and, of course, hitting on everything with a vagina. you know the type, the one that starts with the women so far out of his league they are dots from where he is standing, and works his way down. the one that will literally pause between rejections and do a full scan of the bar before deciding which girl is hot enough to pursue next. after having his fedora called out by us the first and only time he gave us a chance, he never tried again, but he was a permanent fixture in the bar. what really upset me about brian the tool was how he treated a particular barfly, michelle. now, michelle was a sweet heart, and possibly the nicest girl you'll ever meet, but she was also chris farley's long lost sister. i'm not joking, i wish i had a picture, because this girl was what happened if you slapped a dark cherry wig on tommy boy. she also didnt believe in make up. at any rate, every night, if brian couldn't score himself a pity fuck (i'm going to say i saw him get one twice in 3 months), and michelle was around, he'd take her home. he wouldn't speak to her all night, and she once mentioned to me how she didnt even have his cell phone number, but if she was there, she would wait patiently until the bar shut down and him to bump her ugliest uglies. it was one of the weirdest things too; each time it happened, he would approach her like a kid who just got clothes on xmas, and sadly whisper the first sentence to her he had all night. then, he would leave, and she didnt seem to be allowed to follow him out for 5 minutes, as though he didnt want us to know; but, we all knew. at any rate, since we couldn't help michelle (we mentioned it was degrading, but she wouldn't have it, so you can only let moths flock to flames), we gave up and let them do their dance every week. flash forward 3 months, and i'm invited to a wedding by a guy i've been seeing. walk through the door, and there's brian... with a very decent looking girl. immediately upon seeing me, brian refuses to make contact, and veers his chica far, far away. i figure she's just a date he somehow conned, so i think nothing of it. in passing, i mention to my date that i know the guy, and get the response "oh yeah? that's kristin's fiancé." come again? oh, yeah, kristin is this super sweet nurse studying to become a pediatrician, and has been dating brian for 2 years, engaged for six months. apparently, to help put herself through school and help support her apartment with brian (who works as a very fancy temp worker at an amazon warehouse), kristin outs in 10 hour overnight shifts at the hospital. suddenly, its clear how brian gets away with going to the bar and pussy scouting every night: his girls earning money and investing in the future, and he's getting his dick wet with literally anything that will take it. now, this is a wedding. love is in the air, and the words "trust, honor, and faithfulness" are the themes. and i am pissed at this useless, good for nothing asshat that treats women like a buffet of squishy wet holes for his taking. also, his fedoras were just really fucking stupid quietly, without telling my date, i sneak up behind the tool, and corner him. he goes into deer in headlights mode, and kristin seems annoyed (i guess women pop up all the time?) "hey, brian? remember me? i'm the girl from (insert bar name)!" kristin reacts, subtly, to the bars name. i get the feeling she's told brian she doesn't want him going here. "oh, yeah, hey." "yeah! hey, last weekend, i let michelle borrow my lighter" kristin turns her head to look at brian. michelle is a familiar name! "uh. okay?" "well, i asked her for it the other day, but she said she lost it. i was wondering if it was on your floor?" i get a nasty, spiteful retaliation from brian, basically saying fuck no, but the damage was done. i watch kristin storm away dramatically, and cant help but smile smugly as i watch him chase her. a half an hour later, both of them are gone from the wedding party. tl;dr: fuck fedoras.i wasn’t quite sure if i should post this in /r/talesfromtechsupport or /r/pettyrevenge, but its more about karma revenge than anything else. back in my high school days, i was the typical budding introverted male computer geek. i was quiet, kept to myself, pretty much the stereotypical chess nerd who loved to read books and play video games. i had my share of bully stories and random kids that picked on me but one particular uppity bitch had it in for me. let’s call her valerie battitude for the sake of this story. i was in her scopes nearly every day for the 4 years i attended high school. val and her teengirlsquad group of friends would torment me ruthlessly to the point i attempted suicide at a particular low point in my life. the constant name calling, the snide remarks, questioning of my sexuality, the bullying never stopped even with administration intervention. high school wasn’t particularly bad for me, but it was val who made my life a literal living hell. i was powerless because she was the queen bitch and i had at least one class with her every semester. high school ends and i get my college degree. my career takes off and i advance several times. sadly, my company hits hard times and i'm laid off along with most of my staff. months turn into nearly a year as i’m waiting for my next job but my emergency nest egg is getting low. in order to support myself, i take up an old part-time tech job working for my former employer. he was glad to have me back and i got to pick up some extra cash doing in-home tech work on the side while i continued the job search. my boss gets a call from a long time client and sends me out to handle it. it’s pretty cut-n-dry on paper but after checking the name, it dawns on me that this client is the father of valarie battitude. i instantly have horrible flashbacks of all the torture i went through in hs. realizing i’m not the same wimpy geek in hs, i swallow my hateful pride to knock on the door. father battitude greets me warmly and we briefly converse with idle chit-chat. i don't let him on that i knew his *** of a daughter nor that she was the bane of my existence in my hs days. i do find out that his daughter is temporarily staying back at papa’s home as she is out traveling the country for work. he had divorced from mama battitude who took half his savings account over an unnamed incident that led me to believe she cheated on him. clue #1: figured out where val got her bad attitude from. we get down to business and he explains his computer problem(s). the main issue being that the dinosaur of a pc is practically a relic of state-of-the-art fossil fuel by modern day comparisons. i quickly demise no amount of software repair and malware removal is going to fix the speed problem he's facing. it takes a whopping 20 minutes to boot into the log in screen and i ball my fist into a tight ball when i see "val battitude"'s name as the secondary accounts on the windows login screen. shrugging it off, i recommend to papa that getting a new computer rather than spending the hours it will take trying to get it back up to merely poor standards. he agrees and wants me to go with him the store and pick one up… that day! i’m conflicted as this is the father of rosemary’s baby but it’s obviously not entirely his fault his daughter is the bitch from hell... so i say "what the hell" and agree. i call my boss and he's ok with me doing some consulting work over the pc repair he originally sent me on. i'm off the clock on by my bosses standards and it’s off to xyz computer store. we are shooting the breeze at what he does for a living but mostly it’s about how he is proud that his daughter is an entrepreneur for some startup company on the web and how she is constantly traveling the state and country. i'm controlling my gag reflex from the puffy clouds and sparkly rainbows his daughter excretes. how can he talk about the very same person that would knock my lunch into the ground and then “accidently” step on it while looking at me in the eye and mock “i’m sooooo sorry!” we get to the store and i find out through conversing with him and the sales associate that his computer we are replacing is actually val's old college computer that he recently commandeered while she was away. food for thought... enough technical jargon to sink a battleship and 3 hours later: father battitude is the proud owner of a new top-of-the-line computer and wireless network system. i install the new pc, get it up and running along with the new printer, wifi, multiple accounts setup along with windows remote access in case he needs my boss to log in for basic help (standard procedure). i move onto installing the old harddrive for the data transfer and father battitude has long since vacated the room to go watch tv elsewhere. my loath and disgust resurfaces as my eyes wandered across the documents of valerie's personal files. the data transfer starts reading off odd file name that catch my eye. it doesn’t occur to me, given the source, just what i’m seeing skim across the screen so i manually follow the path to said directory of her old pathetically encrypted harddrive. the discovery of several thousand megabytes of personal porn pictures and hardcore webcam videos halts me in my tracks. this wasn't the vastly gifted entrepreneur daughter papa battitude had led on about. this was an ageing webcam pornstar who was out touring the country doing porn or hooking up with her latest fling. my curiosity turned into disgust and contempt as i skimmed through several dozen more photos of freakish and occasional kinky stuff where she is degrading men or causing pain. i have no problem in general with what someone does for a living. my thoughts were at that instant that this bitch is using men and continuing to cause more pain even after hs. i had more reason to despise and hate her over anyone else... and i had her in the palm of my hands. wheels started turning, daddy was obviously none the wiser to what his daughter did for a living and my conscience started a personal war with my ego. at one end was my willingness to extract revenge and the other was my morale’s saying to forgive and let it go. i settled on a happy medium that both sides gleefully agreed with. my fear of being sued or that i could get my boss into some serious trouble prevented me from going too far so an evil little revenge scheme would have to suffice. i uploaded all the files in question to my remote file server and got to work figuring out the best way to humiliate a domineering *****. papa snottybitch was enthusiastically watching a game that would occupy him for a few hours so i took the time to organized all her photos and videos onto her newly created desktop. each folder got a unique fetish name as i filled each one with her personal pictures of shame and degradation. i started to get more and more creative as i began to have fun with it. "valerie of xxhs class of xxxx takes on 2 guys at her daddies home". or "watch valerie battitude get dped on her parents bed". i was cackling with glee as i rigged the coup de gras. none of the files could be deleted/changed/removed without administration approval. guess who had that! mwahahahahaah! two weeks later i get the phonecall i was waiting for from my boss. father battitude request that i take a look at his daughter’s login account as there was something wrong with it. the look on her face when i showed up at her father's doorstep was priceless. anger and rage quickly sinks into horror and regret as it dawns on her just who was behind all this. the next half hour was mostly sobs and her saying "sorry" a thousand times over. i'm a softy at heart but like captain malcolm reynolds of firefly says, "i'm a good guy... [stabs the guy in the gut] well i'll settle for just all right.". **tl:dr version: hs bully gets just deserts more than a decade later as all of her personal webcam/porn files are organized and displayed in a humiliating way. then is duped into meeting face-to-face to her horror.** - edited the name of valerie. - edit: i wrote this story to help me with my writing skills. "write what you know". please note that i wrote this in an attempt to get in my old self (ie character). this does not reflect who i am now. by simply googling my dead brother's name, i uncovered the pro revenge he attempted to exact on our mother by killing himself. i'm the youngest of three boys. my oldest brother committed suicide in 2003 at age 48 without leaving a note... here's the story. my oldest brother grew up a conflicted man. he was brilliant and honest, but he had a very volatile relationship with our mother that seemed to center around her attempts to hold onto and control money. we all felt this as we were very poor, but my oldest brother seemed to take her efforts to deny us the basics of life personally. the rest of us felt that our meager lifestyle of yard sale clothes, no toys, barber school haircuts, dented cans and stale bread was simply a product of our poverty. by the time he reached his early 20's, he moved out but continued to stop by and try to engage our mother in arguments designed to "teach" her the errors in her thinking. this never went well. he eventually went to brown university on a full scholarship and began teaching in an inner city setting. it was at this point (around 1987) that he began his decent into depression and major mental illness. he self-medicated with alcohol and anti depression meds. i could see the changes in him monthly. by 1996, he was not the same person that i grew up with. he picked verbal fights, saw enemies everywhere and began to act out at his job. i later learned that it was around this point (and i'll explain how later) he decided to commit suicide. but he had unfinished business with my mother so he concocted a twisted scheme aimed to devastate her at her weakest moment. he purchased a secret life insurance policy, named my mother as the beneficiary without her knowledge, and secretly paid the premium every moth despite he and his wife having deep financial issues. of course his wife knew nothing of the suicide plans or the policy. insurance policies have a lengthy waiting period before they will pay out in the case of a suicide, but that's okay because my brother wanted to have a little fun before killing himself anyway. his "fun" included adopting the concern level of a honey badger and messing with every teacher, student, administrator and custodian he disliked. his devastating intellect was his weapon and he used it to embarrass and shock his targets. he eventually was suspended multiple times for verbally assaulting a janitor and for allowing his 7th grade students to cut his hair and drive his car. he also created drama by telling stories of bar fights with famous people and lying to get out of attending meetings. he had become an out of control prick and was drinking everyday. his wife held it together but she was beginning to crack under the pressure. all the while, my brother was fine because he knew it would all be over soon and he was living his new life of giving zero fucks. and his plan to screw with my mother was coming along fine. i attempted to get him into numerous programs. i even cut ties with him from my own children and told him that all he needed to do was to get into a program and (even if he failed) could resume our close contact. he opted to continue his rampage. our parents saw no real need for concern, so they didn't join with me. my father even expressed anger at me for me giving him that ultimatum. around 2000, he began "predicting" his own death to his classes. knowing that 7th graders are very gullible, he shrouded it with being told by psychics that he would die at home and in a year that ended with a 3. this is what i learned by googling his name about 8 years after his death. when i did, a link to a video game forum popped up and a pm 8 year-old post by one of his students had made about his teacher dying. this is when i realized that my brother's suicide was planed years before he did it. i emailed that student and he gave me the whole story of my brother riveting the class on several occasions with tales of his own death. here's the intended revenge plan and its 8 years too late exposure: in 2011, my mother passed. my brother's death 8 years earlier began her mental and physical breakdown. all she wanted to know was 'why?' of course we had no idea why. but her death triggered a records search at prudential insurance where she had her own policy. my dad had begun the wheels in motion by filing for her payout and the search kicked back my brother's name because that was (ironically) where he had his secret life insurance policy. the agent asked my dad who the person who came back in the search was and my dad stated that it was his oldest son who had committed suicide back in 2003. you see, my brother (despite his brilliance) didn't know how life insurance worked and he assumed that his death would somehow cause his policy to force a payout to my mother. this would have happen when all of us were deep in contemplation as to why he would kill himself - and right then my mother would then get the check. the check was his suicide note directly to my mother alone... and it was the one thing that has dogged their relationship forever... money. but the insurance company did not know of his death in 2003. they assumed he'd just allowed the policy to lapse. my brother's wife knew nothing of the policy and neither did my mother. my dad (who is 87 and failing) never connected the dots as he doesn't know of my brother "predicting" his own death. my father provided prudential with the copy of the death certificate of both my brother and my mother and they verified that the policy was enforce at the time of my brother's suicide and sent my dad the benefits check. i've never told my dad any of this as it would probably kill him. i shared the details with my middle brother and he agrees that this was exactly what my oldest brother was up to. *edit for clarity: this was my brother's attempt at revenge. obviously he failed by not understanding that insurance companies need to be notified of someone's death before they pay. and yes, he was in pain and needed help, but he refused it. he claimed that he "couldn't relate to average people" who were in aa and wouldn't go. he was an elitist who used his intellect as an excuse to keep drinking and abusing prescription meds. he was deeply, deeply troubled. short time lurker, first time poster. blah blah blah. background: you see, kids, i was the awkward kid in high school. this tale takes place at the end of my sophomore year. i had grown up quite a bit since i was a freshman, but still had a long ways to go (i bloomed in college). by the end of my sophomore year, i had seen my confidence grow from awkwardly shy to be more outgoing i had a good group of friends and was finally becoming my own person. the cast of characters for this tale is short, but important: **deb**: girl in my class. snooty, thought she was better than everyone else. was usually the first to make fun of me for my weight or cheap clothes. **dani**: senior girl, gal pals with deb. also snooty, also thought she was better than everyone else because ~~she~~ her parents had money. **me**: myself, of course. act 1, scene 1: speech class. rest of the class is running lines and prepping for our end of year production. i'm putting the finishing touches on the sound and lighting setup. &gt;**deb**: hey david808, how are you doing cutie? ------------------------------**pause** now, keep in mind, she wasn't even in my speech class...or the play. she was just in there. also, keep in mind, she had treated me like crap for the last two years. so when she called me cutie, i knew something was up. ---------------------------**unpause** &gt;**me**: i'm...um...fine? &gt;**deb**: dani and i need some help. i'm nearly failing $statehistory and so is dani. we were wondering, if you would help us pass our final in $statehistory. the entire time, this girl is overtly flirting with me (which is very very out of the ordinary) and knowing both of these girls, the fact that they weren't passing $statehistory wasn't surprising. &gt;**me**: *i know she doesn't mean tutoring* so, how do you want me to help? &gt;**deb**: you know how you make an a on every history test? we'd like for you to give us answers. &gt;**me**: what do i get out of this? &gt;**deb**: our appreciation. *she says this as she is lightly running her fingernails down my chest* &gt;**me**: *thinking: i know that this is a lie and that she'll use and forget me asap. i'm not falling for it* so, you want me to just give you answers? all three of us are taking the test at the same time. so, deb tells me about her scheme. her and dani will sit to my left and behind me. all i have to do is lean back and let them see my scantron sheet. they'll fill out their answers and turn them in. simple as that. thinking to myself: i know that i'm just being used. they'll do this and continue to treat me like crap. however.... &gt;**me**: i'll do it. it will cost you $20 each up front, and in cash. in exchange, i'll give you answers for the test. deb proceeds to pay up for her and dani. **act 2, scene 1** right before the test &gt;**me**: *whispering to deb and dani right before the test is handed out.* be sure to turn your tests in first, if we turn them in at the same time it will look suspicious. crazy enough, they both *agree* to this while telling me it's a good idea. the test starts, and i fill in answers on the scantron, and lean back and to the side...all according to plan. ten minutes later, they hand in their answer sheets and sit down. meanwhile, i've been erasing my answers since they stood up. filling in the correct answers that i had lightly marked while filling in the wrong answers the first time on my test. of course, deb and dani saw this. however, they could do nothing at this point (our teacher had a rule about not changing answers on a test one you handed it in). they watched me fill in all the correct answers and turn it in. **act 3, final scene** out in the hallway, deb and dani are asking me why i changed the answers on my test. &gt;**me**: i told you that i would give you answers and i did that, but nowhere, did i promise you the **right** answers. deb and dani both stomp off. later on that day, they tell me that their boyfriends are going to beat me up and key my car. **post script** there comes a time in everyone's life when they learn the consequences of their actions mean something. for me, i was $40 richer and a minor hero to everyone who had been on the receiving end of their derision. on the plus side, deb never spoke to me again. for them, they learned a very important lesson that day. one, i hope they never forgot. especially when they had to repeat the class during the summer. especially since, during the summer session, the teacher handed out timed essay tests rather than multiple choice tests. a few years ago, i ran into deb. she still won't speak to me. something that, upon further reflection, i still consider to be a good thing. **fin** tl;dr: cheating is bad kids. failing at it is even worse. edit: formatting over in /r/justiceporn, /u/toastedchillies [tells a story about getting revenge on one of his wife's colleagues]( &gt; so i'm a bit of a chilli head. love my hot sauces. i also love to cook. i also cook my wife a delicious lunch each day, she kept complaining that someone was stealing her lunch every couple of days out of the fridge at work. so i made her some buffalo wings for lunch to put in the fridge, they are really popular with her colleagues but i spiced them up just a little with some blair's 4am reserve. (i note you are meant to dilute it with 1 drop per 5 litres of liquid). so i added a couple of drops of blairs 4am reserve per wing with nice dusting of ghost chilli powder for good measure. i did eat a couple to make sure it didn't kill anybody, they were real hot. even cream doesn't cut the heat: and ghost chillies keep getting hotter for about 5 minutes. needless to say just before lunch, there was a shrill from the kitchen, a young male college decided to help himself the my wife's lunch which was clearly marked with her name. he ran to the toilet and vomited over and over. apparently the moans sounded like he was dying. my wife just sat there innocently pretending nothing was wrong. needless to say she has not lost a single lunch since.just so you know this story is not mine it belongs to /u/canibalfoodfite in a ask reddit thread not my story. i while ago, i was under a supervisor that was clearly incompetent. he was dangerous to work with, completely lacked the necessary knowledge , abusive to clients, and very abusive to those under his supervision. none of us had even the slightest respect for him. everyone on the crew, at one time or another, had a major blowup with him. he was known for throwing things, and had nearly killed a few people due to his negligent incompetence. finally, one day he began to scream at me over something hilariously petty and i lost my shit. i got in his face and told him exactly what a useless piece of shit he was. going so far as to say "you are the reason i support abortion! your mother could have flushed you down the toilet and made the world a better place!" not one of my proudest moments. it was extremely unprofessional of me. i gave him my badge and told him "i quit! find someone else to exercise your sick need to be abusive and cruel on! i'm not the guy!" i went out to my car, called hr, and let them know that i was leaving the company because "i don't come to work just to be abused. i care about being a good employee, i want to do an excellent job, and i am completely open to critique. i want to learn, and take responsibility for my mistakes, but i don't deserve to be abused." the hr rep offered me "administrative leave" while they do an investigation. i accepted, but made it clear that if my supervisor stayed that i would absolutely not be returning regardless of the circumstances. fortunately, the supervisor above the one that i lost my shit on, the person that usually put his own job on the line to protect my supervisor, was on vacation. everyone else on the crew backed me up, and ratted our supervisor out on all his extreme bulshit. a week and a half later i received a call from the the regional manager. i was informed that i could come back to work if on the upcoming monday, and that my supervisor would not be returning. i accepted and returned to work. they gave me full pay for the time i was gone. i actually got paid for staying home, looking for other jobs, and playing video games. it was pretty sweet justice. i received (deservedly so) a letter of reprimand due to my language and inappropriate statements. worth. tldr: got paid to get my asshat manager firedi recently graduated from college in another state. during that time, i rented a house with 3 other girls in a primarily student neighborhood. we were neat, responsible tenants who paid rent/bills on time and took care of the house. but we were first-time renters and therefore clueless about tenant law. the landlord was very aware of that and used it to his advantage. i could go on forever about what a douchelord he was, but the tl;dr version is that he was sexist, would regularly enter the house without our permission, overcharge for *every*thing and then get all offensive when we questioned it, did not keep his house up to city code and ignore our requests for repairs. all-in-all, he was not a nice person. you could have a more pleasant and productive conversation talking to a brick wall. we did try to get legal help from the university legal services office on a few occasions, but since we already signed the lease, there was not a lot that could be done. anyway, towards the end of our lease, whenever potential tenants would come tour the house, we would take them aside and tell them not to sign a lease with this man. we sabotaged a few attempts at finding tenants that way. we also called the university off-campus housing office and told them to not allow him to advertise his property on campus or in the school paper because he was a crappy landlord. the best part was when he called me to ask why i thought nobody was interested in the house. i had to stifle a smile and say, "i don't know... maybe the economy is bad?" edit: added missing wordsnot sure if this is where i should post this, but here goes: so, my girlfriend and i went to our apartment complex pool/spa area and as we're walking up we hear splashing. great, lots of people we think, so we take a look. well 3 guys we guessed to be about 18-21 are throwing the plastic green beach chairs into the pool. uhm. ok. you must be so cool. they see us and stop and start loading up their things in a backpack. we walk over and they go away after a minute of their scrambling and fumbling. i notice there are cameras pointed right at the pool, at least it's being filmed. they get to the outside of the fence and we see them looking with their phone flashlights in the backpack. they come back looking for something, but we don't know what. so i start looking for something, anything that shouldn't be in the area. i don't see anything and by the time they come back a third time they finally say something to us. they're looking for their car key. ha. what irony. i get a good look at the three as their looking for their key. they find it and the guy that finds it says, "nick, i'm driving, i'm the most sober!" wow. the whole time i'm trying to figure out how i can get these guys. it's become clear they don't live in the complex and that they are just pulling a prank on some random complex. they're also about to be driving possibly under the influence. my girlfriend says to them, "you better pull the chairs out, there are cameras and i'll be speaking with the complex manager." one of the guys gets a scared look and says, "oh, uh, ok. yeah, totally." they walk away and look at it and the two guys laugh and talk him out of it. ok. i'm frustrated. so we get ready to leave to get their license plate number. i get a feeling we should go out the opposite side, where the main entrance is. we do and see a security watch. of all the times i've seen a security guard, this is the happiest i've been. we tell him there's 3 guys about to possibly drink and drive that threw all the chairs in the pool that look underage. we tell him that we're not sure where there car is, but saw where they went. so my girlfriend and i head to the apartment and i sneakily go around the apartments and find their car with them in it. bingo. so i run back to my girlfriend and tell her i found them. the security guard comes from the area they were parked asking me where they went. i told him what car it was and he asks what apartment were at and my girlfriend and i go back inside. our roommate comes home an hour later and says, "oh my gosh, there's like, 3 cop cars over by the pool!" so we tell him what happened and i go the sneaky way to where their car was. still there. best guess, one was 21 and supplied the alcohol to the other(s). either way they're in jail. that was last night. tonight the security guard came back and asked for my name, saying all 3 went to jail. when i asked the charges, he said they were arrested for trespassing and underage drinking. the oldest was 17 and blew a .27. the middle was 15 and blew a .18 and the youngest was 14 an blew a .17. sucks for them.many years ago i started a job and in my department was a young lady who was just a loud-mouthed, rude, crude, bad tempered and nasty bitch. she was just a bitch. i am sure some of you have come across one of these people in your life. anyway. back then, there was no caller id on the phones like today. i decided one day after hearing her yell again at someone, to pick up the phone and call her. she sat on the other side of the office but i could hear her and see her pick up the phone. when she picked up the phone i quietly just hung up. i would turn down the volume on my speakerphone and have the mute button on while i dialed. when i would hang up, it was just matter of me silently clicking it off. when this would happen i could hear her yell "dammit!" over and over again. "dammit!" i would do this like 3 or four times a day. sometimes i would get up and go to the fax machine and dial her from there to deflect any suspicion. "dammiit!" i would hear. i would suffer in silence as i tried and succeeded in suppressing my laughter. one day i saw the only friend i had in the office get into a fight with her. "i just hate that bitch." he told me. i decided to let him in my mini-world of revenge. he started to do it as well. she would scream "dammit! who's doing that?" and look around the room. my buddy and i just kept working and she couldn't figure out who her wrong-number-phone-stalker in the room was. he would do the fax trick as well. when i finally quit my job i would call her like once a week and prank her three or four times in a row. my friend would call me and say "dude was that you?" "she's so pissed! she's going crazy!" and proceeded to tell me that she was screaming all over the place like a crazy woman and that management had been called on her various times. of course we would laugh about it. a couple of years later i get called into an office meeting and a supervisor asks me if i know a person from my previous job who was applying for a job at my current company. it was her and she was in the other room. i go to meet her and there she was, a broken woman. she was somehow different. i told her if she wants a job here she cannot do the same shit she pulled off in the other place and if she ever does i have the power to fire her. she proceeds to tell me that she had realized that she had been overbearing and that she had a real talk down by her former boss and that she had learned to control her anger. so believe it or not i gave the go ahead and gave her the job. and yes, she did change. the people loved her at the new job and she was a productive and good employee.twenty-five years ago, my husband had his identity stolen by a close friend. this "friend" (who i'll call lil' mikey) racked up tens of thousands of dollars in bills (i.e. car, apartment, utilities, cellphone) before he was caught. it was a nightmare that literally took years to get straightened out. i'd never even met the guy, but hoped that one day i'd get the opportunity to let him know exactly how i felt. lil' mikey was a real tool. he'd stolen the identities of and ripped off a number of other people too, including his own family members, friends, and the mothers of his several illegitimate children. he'd pulled off insurance scams by faking injuries. he'd stolen money from a bunch of kids on a youth sports team he coached. he did some jail time, moved away, and hadn't been seen in ages. until last year... a mutual friend was shocked to see lil' mikey refereeing a high school basketball game and texted a pic to us. it was surprising that he'd come back to a town where he'd screwed over so many people, and even more surprising that he'd found employment in a school district given his felony convictions. around the same time, another mutual friend saw lil' mikey on the state's most wanted deadbeat dads website. this was fate. i put on my nancy drew hat and got to work. i scoured the photo for clues as to which teams were playing, verified the date of the game, tracked down organization that provided refs for the game, and wrapped it all up with a big red bow for the state's department of social and health services most wanted tip line. there isn't a nice tidy ending to this story. i never heard back from dshs. but i did hear last month that "some lady" had written a letter to lil' mikey's employer and he no longer worked there. and as of last week, lil' mikey is no longer featured on the most wanted website; i'd like to believe that dshs was able to recover back child support for the mothers of his children. i'm a complete stranger to this man and i'm sure he has no idea how this happened to him. it feels incredibly good to be able to extract a small measure of revenge decades later, especially if this helped other innocent people he harmed. i served it up cold, lil' mikey. hope you like it. **tl;dr: karma is a bitch with a long memory. and us bitches be crazy.** so, strap yourselves in, 'cause this is a story about my old opa, who scared the bejeezus out of an awful old (and awfully old) lady. but first, a bit of weirdness - back then, people didn't sue each other that much. which explains the lack of lawsuits in this story. so, my aunt, let's call her mary, lived in an apartment. her neighbours were this old couple who were incredibly petty and mean, let's call them husband and wife. just for disagreeing with them, they started putting glue in her door-lock and throwing rotten fruit on her balcony. this got out of hand, until mary really didn't want to be there anymore. most of this stuff was done by the wife. then, my grandfather heard of it. oh boy. so, first of all, my grandpa is awesome. seriously, he had pretty much every job in the world and skipped the east-west german border three times. he's clever. and he is a vengeful son-of-a-biactually i don't know anything about his mother. you see, both of these awful people were really old, but the husband was still working. my opa called the funeral director of our little town and told him he was the brother of the husband, that he had recently died and that the widow would need advice for the funeral, but that she didn't like to leave the house, so the director would have to visit her. he also told him that she sometimes was a bit delusional, that she didn't quite want it to be true - the director should be nice, but firm with the fact that he was dead. now, the funeral business isn't big, we were a small town back then. so the funeral director only had one car - the hearse. he rolled up in front of her door. the husband was working, just like my grandfather had planned. the director, in his nice official suit, rang the bell and explained to the "widow" that he had come because of her dead husband. now, contrary to what the title suggests, she didn't have a heartattack. but darn, she was hit pretty hard. she never ever did anything mean to my aunt again. not saying it was nice what he did, but this is petty revenge, after all. (i first posted this in petty revenge, but i was told it fit here better. i guess it does.) note - i did originally post this to pettyrevenge but i was told to share it with prorevenge **background** i work in a big international company, instore as a part of the warehouse operative (basically we do everything for everyone). the manager of the warehouse team is a ~~really nice person~~ cunt. she employed her son full time when he turned 18 and gave him his own pick at what hours he would like. so now he has become her whipping boy when she is around (never), but when she is not he does as he likes. he orders people around, shouts at people and sits on his big fat ass and does nothing at all. **the actual story** so the other day after feeling bad all day i told him that if i feel this shitty i will not be coming in tomorrow and i will call his mum and tell her. so i carry on working the rest of the shift, i think he's cool, i dont know why everyone slags him off. we are locking up and he asks me if i smoked weed. i said oh yeah im going to smoke some when i get home. we carry on talking and he admits that he smokes to. shift ends. i call in sick the following day because i feel really shitty. so when i return to work 2 days later i found out he told his mum that i "couldnt be arsed to work" and i was going to lie to get the day off. manager pulls me aside bollocks me. he spreads around work i lied to get the day off. the same day the manager bollocks me, i also get a random locker search. i have some items in my bag that i bought earlier instore. they didnt want to see the reciept, instead they sniffed through my bag saying they where looking for something in particular (obviously the weed). so by now i know that he snitched on me to his mum twice. i then decided i was going to have some fun with it. **revenge** so then i asked him if he wanted to buy some cocaine (something he said he takes all the time) from me. i will be bringing quite a lot in tomorrow at work so he can buy. i hinted that i would have about half a kilo (lol). so when i get to work scan in i get a call from the manager to meet me in the locker room. by the time i get in there three private security officers are following me from the staff room. then i go into the locker room there are a further 8 officers and 1 drug sniffer dog. i get made to open my locker and empty my bag. during this time the manager and her son are standing in the locker room with me smirking. also the regional manager is instore so he is in there to. no drugs in my bag. store gets fined a lot of money for wasting time. his mum gets demoted for calling in the search he gets the sack and trys to fight me. he gets arrested for assault. he gets 7 months in prison. a nice added bonus to my last pay packet. i leave the company the next week to go to university. we are even. **prison** basically i was coming in work one day and he was waiting for me in the staff area. i thought nothing of it and just got changed when i was getting changed coincidentally the a security guard was just starting his shift to. so then when the guy saw me i was with the security guard. he walked up to me and basically punched me in the back of the head whilst i was walking away (cheap shot). but it was all on camera and the security guard was a witness to it all. his mum got a new job after this. for a while, i worked as a web designer in a small ad agency serving a very niche industry. previously, the design team had no creative lead, and were all sort of operating independently across varying clients. we decided to hire a creative director to fill that gap, and i was given the task of sorting through and giving first round interviews to find the person who would later become my supervisor. two candidates in particular stood out from the rest for very different reasons. one was exceptionally talented, an all around nice guy, and somebody who generally would have been great for the role. the other, let's call him john, had mediocre talent, came across as an insufferable, arrogant prick, but had previous experience working within the niche industry that we serviced. he also had contacts within that industry that could lead to new business. despite my *strong* recommendation to not hire john, his relationships in the industry were too compelling to our agency's leadership to pass up, and they hired him. it didn't take long before the entire company started to realize john was a huge burden. he had virtually zero experience in anything related to digital design. design for apps, websites, mobile, etc., were all completely and utterly beyond his grasp, but he used his position of relative power to make decisions on those projects that the entire design team refused to support, most of which came back to bite the company in the ass later. the design team hated him, because fixing and working around his screw-ups became part of our daily routine. the sales team hated him, because he'd claim it took him unbelievably exaggerated amounts of time to complete even the most trivial of tasks (ex: 4 days to design a business card template), so they wouldn't even assign him projects anymore. work that was clearly his responsibility started to rapidly trickle down to the rest of the design team. we'd be working late nights 4 out of 5 days a week, because all of his projects that were in danger of missing deadlines would be re-assigned to us. meanwhile he'd be the first to walk out the door every day, right at 5pm, without fail. on top of all that, the guy was absolutely, without a doubt, the biggest tool i've ever met. always right about everything, completely unbending on his idiotic opinions, and completely clueless that literally every person in the building wished he would get hit by a truck. i genuinely tried to work with him for about a year, until i decided that the job had become intolerable because of him, and wasn't going to change any time soon, so i turned in my two week notice. about a month after i left, i heard that he had been let go from the job. shortly after that, i noticed that he had changed his linkedin status to show that he was working for a new agency i had never heard of, also servicing that same niche industry. i looked them up, and quickly figured out that he had started his own agency... a primarily digital agency... when he had no experience in digital or interactive design, and had literally fucked up every digital/interactive project he'd ever been on (i know, because most of them were reassigned to me when he proved incapable of doing them himself). i looked at the portfolio on his website, and found literally project after project of ***my*** work. he was using my work from the ad agency as examples of the work his agency could produce. i briefly considered contacting him and requesting he remove my work from his portfolio for ethical reasons. but i could already hear his reply in my head. "as creative lead, all work done by my team is an extension of my creative direction." he'd used similar lines in the past to insert himself into receiving credit on successful projects he'd had zero involvement on. so instead i sent an email to one of the partners of the agency we both had worked for, saying something along the lines of "hey, not sure if you've noticed this, but it looks like john is using your company's intellectual property to directly compete against you... if i had to guess, i'd assume his next step would be to make a move at your client list." the reply was short and sweet: "thanks for bringing this to my attention. he'll be hearing from our attorney in the morning." john's website was brought down less than 24 hours later. years ago i lived in a coastal city and became friends with a guy who owned a boat. he kept his boat docked near a popular tourist area and the garage he used was often full due to the crowds. as a slip owner he had a pass that would give him priority at a private garage entrance so he could skip the lines and be more certain of getting a parking spot, this is not uncommon for private garages that offer monthly passes or passes to employees. also due to the crowds, this garage had a computer that would count the number of cars going in and the cars going out, it would not let any vehicles into the garage if there were no spots available. one day my friend used his pass to get into the garage, knowing it was nearly full. after doing a full lap of all levels he realized the only remaining spot was next to an older shit-brown (metallic!) corvette with vanity plates that had parked about a foot over the line. well, sucks to be that guy, my friend pulled his little suv in, blocking the driver's door of the 'vette. after all, parking is scarce and this guy didn't pay for two spots? petty revenge! later that night, after a day on the water, he returned to find that the corvette owner apparently didn't like having his door blocked and retaliated by keying the side of my friend's cherokee. he filed a claim, lost his deductible and got the side of his jeep repainted. about a year later he bought another boat and was working to restore the cabin. he drove into the garage as he always does and starts looking for a spot, when what does he see? the same shit-brown corvette with the same vanity plate. well, the heavens were certainly thinking of justice today. he got out of his jeep and opened the tailgate to peruse the plethora of instruments that were at his disposal, after all, he had a boat load of tools to restore his old boat. screwdriver? not much you can do with that. hammer? too cliche. belt sander? no power cable. battery powered nail gun? folks, we have a winner! a few quick minutes later the fiberglass body of the corvette was perforated by nails. just putting nails through body panels is hardly fair to the nail gun, after all, nails are supposed to connect things together; they must fulfill their purpose, we wouldn't want those nails to suffer an existential crisis, would we? so the doors, hood, boot lid, pop-up headlights, and even the fuel cap were all nailed shut. do not fuck with another man's ride, revenge will be served and it may be very cold indeed.my 2nd true love: ally grew up in the tampa, got married at 17 and moved to the sticks with her hs sweetheart. she said this made her unhappy. she missed her family and friends but says she tried to hang in there. it didn’t work out. it ended bitterly when she got drunk and slept with the little town’s playboy. her husband found out when she threw it in his face during a fit of anger and rage. she left, moved back home to her mom and dad and filed for divorce. she brought the baby, now 18 months old with her. we met, fell in lust, and she professed her love. i was smitten. she was 10 years my junior and a fireball in the sack. by 17 weeks we moved in together. by the 19th week i was watching the kid while she was out with friends at night. holy crap did i screw up. by the 27th week i had had it. i knew almost instantly she was doing to me exactly what she did to her ex. i was sobering up, pissed and determined not to be shit on by this little bitch. but i’ve been around the block so i thought i’d play this one cool and see what kind of reaction i’d get. all of this happened in the late 70s when phones were wired to the wall and no one even dreamed of cell phones. i’m no dummy so i wired a cassette player to turn on whenever the receiver was picked up and record directly from the phone line. within a week i had most of her secrets. sure enough, there was another guy in the picture but she had not yet moved to full out betrayal. i boiled inside. i knew i was treating her differently but she never even noticed the change. god what a bitch. during the day i sold stereo equipment and a couple nights a week played drums with a garage band. most weekends we’d pick up gig’s locally or at least close enough to drive. after swallowing my pride, i filled the band in on what was happening. they laughed, smacking hands and exchanging $20’s. apparently they had bet on how long this one was going to last. assholes. i shouldn’t really take the credit for the revenge since it was “dirt”, our bass player, who suggested it, and the rest of the guys played crucial roles. first failure, sort of set the tone: on a thursday night she was “going out with the girls”, but i knew from the phone trace she was meeting up with mike and they we headed to the causeway beach. the causeway was the lovers’ lane in tampa but was also know for drugs, drinking etc. at around 10pm robbie, our lead singer, called the tampa pd complaining about prostitutes on the causeway and gave them a tip about one particular van, mike’s van. i took her kid and rode with dirt to see the show from down the beach. the cops showed up about 10:30, shined lights in the van and pulled ally and mike out. i was stoked to see them get busted. but, damn it all to hell, they must have talked their way out of it because by 11 the cops had gone and ally and mike drove off. almost: the next tuesday she was planning another “girls night” but i didn’t get any phone info so asked dirt to follow her from my place using his girlfriends car. he traced them to a dance club inside a holiday inn. dirt called me from a payphone and i asked him to call the club and act like he was part of vice checking for known prostitutes but before he did to have his buddy roger try to proposition ally right in front of mike. roger’s ruse didn’t pan out very well since ally acted all offended. dirt gave the holiday inn people a description of ally and her name and within a few minutes she was escorted out. he heard some of the commotion because ally was cussing up a storm. dirt told me later that mike was kind of backing away from her and ended up going to his own van and leaving without her. dirt followed mike thinking they were going to meet up again but they didn’t. ally didn’t come home until about 2am. i found out the next night after listening to the phone messages that she went over her fat girlfriends place. i also found out mike believed she was a prostitute and didn’t want anything else to do with her. the finale: thursday i packed all my stuff and moved out of our apartment. i left without a note, just moved all my shit out of there. called and cancelled the phone and electric. ignored the rent since it was paid up for the month. ally came home, went to her fat friends house and called everywhere looking for me and finally found me at the stereo shop. she came in with her fat girlfriend and wanted to know why i left. i told her “i found out you were a prostitute and couldn’t take it so i left”. she screamed over and over in the store “i am not a prostitute. i swear to god. i swear.” god i still love thinking about that. last i heard she had moved to st. petersburg. i am certain she still believes that i think she was a prostitute when all she was really was a cheating whore. edit: corrected the time. fixed typos. i thought bass was a fish but arrogantsob lived up to his name. clarified the phone for ameriyana. and clutchingmytinkle is obviously a vertical video lover if he can't figure out the cassette wiring - duh, it's not rocket science dude. but maybe, since i helped with wiring the sound for the band i know a little about this stuff.a few years ago, having just come out of a long term relationship, i was seeing a girl who was a bit crazy, let's call her sarah. i also had a very long term (female) friend, who had just broken up with her long-term bf, (let's call him grant). whilst grant had been cheating on and gaslighting my friend, the two of them for some reason decided to stay friendly. grant had lived with her (more like loafed off her) and somewhere to live now that they had broken up. i got a call fairly late at night asking if he could stay with me, which i said yes to. i'd never particularly liked grant, but i figured that anything between my friend and him was none of my business and i needed someone to split the rent with. grant moved in and we got on relatively well. one evening, sarah, grant and i went to the pub, we had a few drinks and then headed back to mine. grant knew that sarah and i were involved. fast-forward about a week, and grant has borrowed my laptop and got chatting with sarah online as an msn message has popped up with her saying hello - he said that it was him, not me, and they chatted. no problems here. a few days later, grant asks to borrow my computer one evening whilst i'm out. i tell him the password, joke about using incognito mode if he's being naughty and forget about it. when i get home, i ask him for the computer so that i can use it in the morning. first thing in the morning, i open the computer, which had run out of battery in the middle of grant using it. grant had been talking to sarah on msn and the last few lines of their conversation was visible. it seemed somewhat inappropriate, but i thought it must be innocent. i scrolled up to investigate and discovered that the two of them had been sending photos/videos to each other, culminating in a video from grant to sarah of a "tribute" nature (thankfully the pictures/videos had all been sent via phones so i wasn't subjected to seeing any of them, but i was pretty narked that he had arranged all of this using *my* computer!). i was furious, but said nothing. grant had a key to my house and owed me about £200 in back rent, which i wanted to get. i talked to my calm, collected, neapolitan colleague about the situation to make sure i wasn't over-reacting and he said "you know what you have to do, *crumpledlinensuit*...". i planned my revenge carefully, being nice to grant the whole time... by a strange twist of fate, that very evening, grant managed to break his door key in the slightly dodgy lock. i immediately took both keys off him and said i'd get a new one cut the next day and not to worry about it. i also casually asked if he could sort out the back-rent and made up a white lie about the landlord pestering me. next morning, grant calls out to me whilst i'm in the shower that he's just popping to the atm (100m from the house) to get the money he owes me. like a flash, i'm out of the shower, dressed and grab a pack of smokes. i run out to the front of the house and sit outside casually smoking. grant returns from the cashpoint, pays me the rent and i offer him a lucky strike, which he takes. i swiftly finish mine (i was about halfway through when he lit up), and say that i'm going inside to put the kettle on, but could he finish smoking outside so the house doesn't smell. i go in, the door locks behind me. i count the money and double check i have his key. a minute or so later the doorbell rings and i lean out of the upstairs window and ask him (loudly) "i was just wondering when it became ok to send videos of yourself wanking to the girl your housemate's seeing?". he asks if we can talk about this indoors and i coldly say "no, if you shit on your doorstep, sometimes you get shit on your shoes! find somewhere else to sleep tonight, you're not coming back in here!". i ask then him if there's anything he needs for the day, then go and get him some clean work clothes, his antidepressants (i'm not totally heartless) and a few other necessities, which i bag up and pass to him out of the window. he has a few hours before he needs to be at work, and i just leave him sitting on the wall outside, whilst i go out the back exit to go to work myself. i tell him that he can send me a message to arrange to pick up the rest of his stuff once he's sorted a place to live. he ended up staying with friends that night, and collecting his stuff a few days later. i have no idea what happened to him afterwards. i never spoke to him again just cold, hard cut him out. sarah sent me a message later that day saying that she thought i was massively over-reacting and to get in contact if i had 'calmed down' enough. i just ignored it. i bumped into her a year or so later, she apologised for her actions and we decided to forgive and forget. i helped her with some academic stuff and we parted on better terms, although it's been several years now since i've seen her. all in all, i was actually more upset with grant than i was with sarah, although i thought it was pretty shitty behaviour all round. i later found out that all the time grant was with my friend, he had been sending similar videos, unsolicited, to girls he worked with. revenge was sweet, especially being so cold about it. tl;dr housemate was inappropriate with lass i was seeing, i locked him out and told him to find somewhere else to live, then never spoke to him again. edit: added in fake names for clarity edit 2: jesus wept! i know there is some **mild** uncertainty about the legality of this, but it was years ago, the guy was a "friend" and was staying there as a favour whilst helping me cover the rent in return. *maybe* some tenancy rights were violated, if **under the law of england and wales and not the usa** the short-term, ad-hoc arrangement we had a) actually counted as a tenancy, and b) could even be proved given that it would only be his word against mine years later that this even happened and just looked like he was kipping in my spare room after breaking up with his gf as a favour as he was giving me cash, but if in the extremely unlikely event that he ever tries to sue me and claim i was his landlord (which would be extremely difficult to both argue and subsequently prove and which i would have no authority to be as i'd be subletting), i'll tell the council that he was living there undeclared (which is his responsibility to do) and get him screwed for council tax that he should have paid whilst he was living there, which would, with standard legal system interest of about 8% compounded over several years, undoubtedly be significantly more than the amount he'd get from me. edit: thanks for the gold anon! i'll use my new powers wisely.... firstly, i apparently suck at reddit formatting, so apologies. secondly, this is probably long. i’ll try to divide it up and put the rest of it in the comments. thirdly, as far as i know, none of this was/is illegal at the time. this happened long, long ago. someone suggested i post it on here, so i’m finally getting around to doing it. my sister gave me permission in that i asked her and she said “what the fuck is reddit? don’t send naked pictures to hackers.” so, not that i was planning on it, but none of y’all are getting naked pictures. fourthly, my sister is mental as in legit medications needed chronic and lifelong, but a great mom. we come to this agreement early on in her mental health crises point that no matter how paranoid or awful it is, she tells me everything that’s going on with her and i can give her feedback with no judgment. it works well. sometimes i tell her she’s right. sometimes i tell her she’s delusional. sometimes i tell her she’s being a dick and to knock it off. she’s told me everything since we were teenagers, and to this day it hasn’t changed. she will motherfucking lie to everyone. and she’s a good liar, don’t get me wrong, but she won’t lie to me. because i know when she’s lying, i call her out on it. and we move on. we have established this relationship because she needed a coping mechanism for if/when she lost touch with reality and she knew she needed one person to trust and keep herself grounded. this is before we knew anything about professional psych help, we were kids. and it still works for us, so it’s all good. finally, let me state that theirs was a marriage doomed from the start, and they both did dick things to contribute to its downfall. this is not a story about me taking revenge over some stupid married fight or what not. a little background: my sister and i are very close. i practically raised her so i mamabear the fuck out of any threats to her happiness and safety. we had an awful childhood, and she, my brother and i survived and have close bonds because of it, but we didn’t leave it undamaged. my sister is bi polar and has these crazy paranoid and depressive episodes sometimes. she’s been on meds for a long time, and for the most part they work. when she was 19 our ma died and she made a series of shitty life choices which resulted in her marrying her high school sweetheart and having 3 kids in two years (one year she had twins). he wasn’t a bad guy, they were just too fucking young. so, about 8 years go by. they are tumultuous years because sister is crazy, bil is young and lacks intelligence (booksmart but not life smart). let me just mention here as a note that regardless of this all, they are both very good parents and the kids to this day have no idea what went down. and they never will as far as we are all concerned. bil through hard work and negligence to his wife and kids (not really his fault, trying to better himself and generally stupid) gets a master’s in education while working full time and manages to snag a full time job teaching as a highschool science teacher. woo hoo. finally, that bitch can start getting home on the weekends and evenings and help with the young’uns. life is good times. story of revenge: so in the year or two since bil has gotten his teaching gig at highschool her has proven himself to not only be good at his job, but immensely popular with students. good on him! the world needs more good teachers. by my sister is unhappy. more and more she’s confiding to me that she thinks bil is cheating on her. turns out the art teacher at the school and he have been co-sponsoring a lot of student clubs together and what not. he has gotten his ear pierced and started to “dress cooler”. i just let her vent. her marriage problems aren’t mine to solve, and being a good sister i stay the shit out of them. things start getting weirder. bil was hella conservative and religious. suddenly he is sponsoring the gay/straight student alliance with the art teacher. awesome, says me. sister is getting more suspicious. tells me they keep ‘accidentally’ running into art teacher when they are out with kids. art teacher is married to superintendent and has kids around her boys age, the kids like to play together. this is happening over the course of a year, just so you know, not all of a sudden. my calls to my sister are getting more frantic. i’m thinking she needs to get her meds adjusted so she does and it calms her down but she’s still convinced something is going on. they have a lot of “text” fights at this point (they don’t argue in front of the kids). shit is starting to escalate. but, being the good sister, i stay out of the marriage. seriously, they could be screwing the entire neighborhood, not my problem. but i can tell things are escalating. she’s accusing him of cheating, he’s calling her paranoid. he starts staying out later for student activities. this leaves no one to watch the kids so she has to start missing therapy and doctor appointments. i step up and call him on it, he denies everything and tells me that my sister refuses to go. i know this is a lie. i don’t call him on it, i just take note. my sister has no family near here. my brother and i both live out of state and everyone else is dead or in prison (cuz that’s how we roll). so she’s alone out there. he puts a passcode on his computer and phone. he tells her it’s because she’s crazy and he can’t trust her to not delete his things. people at her church start shunning her. he friends start dropping out of her life. she has no idea what the fuck is going on. i don’t, because we don’t swing in the same godly circles (i think if i stepped into a church i’d probably combust or something). she’s starting got get unstable because of all of the weirdness. but i can calm her down, keep her in check. she has no friends left at this point except for me. she calls me one day hysterical. she says bil has her convinced to go check herself into a psych ward because she’s ‘delusional’. wut? i ask her about her delusions, and she tells me about things she found on the computer that she ‘imagined” like love letters and shit and they aren’t there now. outside i am calm. inside i am panicking. my sister has been crazy my whole life. i know when she’s having an episode. i can tell by her voice and language. she isn’t having one now but convinced of it. i chat with her to calm her down, tell her if she thinks it’s a good idea, i can’t stop her, but ask if she can wait an extra week because i was flying down the next day to surprise her. she agrees. we hand up, and i buy the next ticket i can get out to go see her and assess the situation. bil picks me up and starts going off about my sister’s mental break, etc. inward eye rolling going on but i act concerned. something to note: i’ve known bil since he was 10. i can read him like a book. i know when he’s lying. he’s scared of me. always has been. he spends the entire damn week on his best behaviors being the husband and father of the year. i know he’s up to some shit at this point because this dude is not acting normal. my sister fills me in on the details of what’s been going on and i have to agree it sounds shady. growing up, i studied on a pretty renowned private school in my neck of the woods. public schools here in this part of the world are terrible so the private school business does not cater to the rich like in north america, it's a requirement for even the middle class. of course there are the cheaper ones and the more expensive ones, and the one i was in was the most expensive in the region. it was pretty hard for my mom to afford it but she busted her ass to be able to provide that to us. as the years went by the tuition kept getting more and more expensive so my mom would have to beg for a discount every year. bullying was getting more and more intense and the school kept turning a blind eye to it. the final straw happened one time i tried to correct a teacher on a grammar error and he went completely apeshit on me, sent me to the director's office and ridiculed me throughout the whole year - and the school sided completely with him. so my mom asked me if i was ok about looking for a new school. this was two years before high school ended and i would have to face the big exam to get into a university (which is how you get into them around here). she went there to give them the news and the school's director said this to her: "*well, good riddance, see you guys in two years when polanetaryforotdds will have to come back and do some extra courses here so he's able to get into a university*" - implying that i wouldn't make it anywhere without the school. i found another school, private but cheaper, and studied there the remaining two years of high school. made life-long friends in the process. studied hard and applied for a test to get into a coveted university, on the most contested program. results are in... passed. in **first place**. if that wasn't sweet enough, days later we are contacted by the school i studied last. they asked me if i wanted to do a commercial that would run on tv and would be plastered all over the city! i never talked to the previous school's director again, but i'm pretty sure he remembered the words he told my mom when he saw my giant mug on a billboard advertising for his competitor.this happened a few years ago, but its memory always gives me a revenge boner. our family home is right in the smack of an open grassland in the outskirts of a mid-sized city somewhere in the philippines. although our neighborhood is sparsely populated, small businesses have sprouted all over since it is situated along a main thoroughfare heading to and fro the city center. among these is a shithole karaoke bar (or “videoke” in the local parlance). this karaoke bar was located right beside the driveway leading to our main gate (our house is surrounded by tall concrete walls and adorned by iron spikes on top which is typical in our country). it first started out as a small daytime cafeteria usually catering to truck and utility drivers and personnel. things were pretty vanilla since it opened and its existence never really bothered us, save for the occasional 16-wheeler blocking our driveway (a honk or two and they would be moving along). later, however, the management decided to reorganize the place into a cheap-ass, open-air bar (putting out tables beside the road) and extended its operating hours deep into the night. along with the revamp came this [machine from hell.]( this is when things began to go bonkers. with just a few drops in the coin slot, customers can now belt out standards from engelbert humperdinck, abba, bee gees, and frank sinatra. alcohol would later up the ante at nighttime. a boozer’s rendition of “my way” is not exactly my idea for a lullaby. this drove my family nuts. although most of the time the karaoke’s decibel level is somewhat bearable inside the house, it’s the murder-inducing singing by william hung-wannabes that really got into us. and adding insult to injury, the bar would sometimes put the karaoke on full blast when they feel like it, mostly at nighttime! my parents first went for the diplomatic approach to address the situation. they politely asked the owner, a potbellied police officer, to at least bring the sound volume down to bearable levels, especially at nighttime. he initially agreed, and things went without a hitch for the next few weeks. we later noticed, however, that the bar had gradually increased the volume until it was back again to pre-agreement levels, even louder than ever. when confronted by my mom, the asswipe owner just dissed her and said that she is being an “elitist” who is trying to put him out of business (the words he used in our local language is harsher, but basically the same idea). a few nights after the confrontation, the bar was hosting a gathering of a local truck driver’s association with beer flowing on the side of the road. that damned karaoke is blaring louder than ever. this, coupled with singing and shouting drunkards, created an atmosphere similar to a cornucopia of hyenas and banshees having an orgy. this was the last straw for my dad, who suddenly flipped from a relatively nice guy into a bastard coated bastard with bastard filling. *(dad later told me he had been plotting this revenge from the time the owner insulted my mom. he was just waiting for the right opportunity and motivation to do it.)* he began dismantling our home sound system (a component hi-fi stereo system) and told me to set it up on our patio by the garden. he went to the storeroom and brought out two very big speakers (the type which you often see at parties and other special events), wired them into the sound system, put on their stands, and placed them at our gate. as if that was not enough, he opened all the doors of our three cars. he then told me to come up with perfect song to use and save it in 4 usb’s; one for the stereo system and three for all the cars. with the usb’s in hand, he then ordered two of my siblings and i to each get into the cars and, upon his signal, to simultaneously press play and turn the volume at max. **hironobu kageyama’s *cha la head cha la* began blasting them out of their wits.** *(i used the original, live, english, and 2005 versions of the song. the ‘05 version was the most badass of them all, chilling effect-wise. it took us four tries before all sound systems became synchronized.)* after our noise barrage started, i slowly scadoodled to our gate and saw the same boozer truck drivers who were gleefully singing moments ago now turned sour-faced and constantly making dastardly looks at our direction. the karaoke bar owner later approached our gate and angrily demanded that we cease from whatever we are doing. the bumpkin even brandished the fact that he is a police officer and can make our lives hell (which, on a hindsight, might have caused real trouble for us). out of spite, he attempted to topple one of the big speakers from its stand but was a tad too short to reach over our gate. my dad, the big ol’ hot and tassy, just wryly smirked and went inside the house. in less than an hour after our sound cannons blasted, the party ended in a puff and some of the customers begrudgingly walked out while hurling invectives (my sister insists she even saw two guys pelting stones) towards our house. much later the karaoke was silenced and the bar closed for the night, hours earlier than usual. the karaoke bar still continued with its shenanigans after that night albeit never going full retard with karaoke’s volume again, at least during the evening. one of the female workers (the owner's mistress, i was told later) verbally slandered me a few days later while i was driving out of the house. i was a law student when it happened so i used some legal gobbledygook to intimidate the douchebagette instead (or so i think). we were already planning to commence legal action when it suddenly boarded up about two months later. one of its waitresses, who used to work for my mom, told us that the bar got a bad rap among its regulars (remember, this place was frequented by truck drivers) because of that night, word spread, and caused business to slow down. that, and some internal strife within the management eventually led to the bar’s ultimate demise. **tl;dr: open-air karaoke bar next door is a noisy nuisance, dad got totally pissed off one night, creates his own ‘sound cannons’ and blasted the place out of business.** **edit: changed "blumpkin" to "bumpkin". my yankee stepgrandad often used the latter to peons he hate (thought he said the former. ho hum.). googled the former; i don't want to get involved in anything scat.**i had a friend key word had. well my friend was a proud business owner and a father of two. he also had a little bit of a drinking problem and decision making problem when he was drunk. we where both like this for awhile, until i grew out of it...he did not. fine his choice. well my friend on occasion would cheat on his wife. by the time he got married we weren't particularly close and i didn't care. how do i know he cheated on his wife? cause he'd drunk text me pictures/stories/etc. he also had another funny habit which my wife didn't think was too funny. he'd post stupid shit on my facebook wall...think sexy nudes, soft core porn (clothes on) that's the best way to describe it. i don't know why he thought this was a good idea needless to say my wife called him up and told him he needs to stop 10 minutes later he did it again at the time i was outside working on my bike...my phone on the kitchen table. my wife grabbed my phone (which was ok we shared phones) and begin going through our text messages (between my friend and i) i was the saint, he wasn't. she screen captured quite a bit of proof... she then told my friend to apologize and stop being a douche... he quote on quote said "you can't fucking stop me" (i suspect he was drunk it was 11:30 am on a sunday after all) she then proceeded to find his wifes facebook page and forward her the screen captures of the pictures and stories of him cheating on his wife... his wife of course was completely caught off guard...and divorced him...and used the evidence my wife sent her to royally and truly fuck him over. he lost his family, his business, his house, his cars, everything...after the legal battle and paying out...he was a broken man. that is how my wife destroyed a man... all he had to do was apologize...throwaway for obvious reasons. so i work in a call centre for a mobile phone provider. you phone me up, i see every last personal bit of detail that you’ve provided with us. especially your phone number. on average i would take anywhere from 60 – 100 calls each day, most of which are not pleasant. i understand customers feel irate, they’re annoyed and upset. i’m okay with customer shouting at me or getting frustrated, because if i was in their position i would be the exact same. so i do my best to help, say my goodbyes and forget all about you. only thing i can do. but there are some calls – some people, who are truly horrible. scum of the earth who feel that because there is a network of sound waves between you and them, that they are above you. better than you, that you’re not even human. and they’re the ones i really hate. backstory: a month ago i receive from a call from a customer. before me she had spoke to an advisor who promised to waive her $800 bill in international charges (ps: always check the website for your service provider. many companies have a maximum charge limited for international rates, usually around $400. but they will never tell you this; you need to challenge them on it!) – right away i could smell bullshit. no one would promised that amount of money because they would never get the authorisation for it. i explained to her that i would have to raise a call listening request to see what was agreed upon. she came back and said ‘oh no it’s okay – i recorded the call’ to which she played the recording back to me. lo and behold, the advisor did promise this. but eh, whatever. she can’t use that recording in a court of law, and we have no way of verifying that recording so i still had to raise the request. i made sure to ask her if she’s recording this call; she replied no. i made sure to warn her that if she was recording the call i was not okay with it and would have to terminate the call. she sternly said she wasn’t and we carried on talking. in the end, i advised her the call listening can take 3-5 working days and if she wanted a separate call-back about the issue, i can raise that for her now. she did, so both where processed (both of which are handled by separate departments). done, dusted call over i went on lunch and swiftly forgot about her. two weeks later someone on my floor calls me over and says ‘this girl wants to talk to you – she said you promised to call her back and that you would credit her account’, i looked over into the account and it’s her again. i explained to him what happened – he could see both requests had been made, but have yet to have been picked up, which happens a lot unfortunately. so he could do nothing else but to raise the issues again with the department and tell her that i would phone her back after 10pm (we close at 9pm). i didn’t know he did this at the time, but obviously he was trying to fob her off. this is a man who i’ve not once ever in my 2 years working here seen get slightly annoyed, yet this girl had him pulling at his hair. i watched in awe, until walking away to make sure i wasn’t caught in the crossfire. today i come back onto the floor after my break and someone else’s manager walks up to me and says sternly ‘you must take this call.’ i ask why, he says ‘my advisor has had this girl on hold for half an hour because she refuses to talk to anyone else. she says you promised this that and the other, yet nothing has happened. she even has a recording of you promising this!’ after some bitching, and trying to explain myself the manager had put his foot down and sat me down in front of the phone that was directly linked to satan’s cum-bucket. ‘hello, you’re speaking to op. how can i help you?’ ‘where the fuck have you been?’ ‘please don’t curse, i’m under no obligation to take this call and i’m doing it for pure goodwill.’ ‘don’t give me that – you promised me $800 off my bill and a call back that very day! it’s a month later and nothing has happened!’ ‘i’m very sorry to hear that, but if i do recall i advised you that i would raise a call-back, not one from myself. again i’m sorry these issues haven’t been resolved, so let my try and fix it for you today.’ ‘bullshit! listen to this:’ she then proceeds to play a recording of ‘me’ promising her money off her bill. she had manipulated it, poorly, to make it sound like i had something i had never done. ‘if i do recall, i specifically asked if you were recording that call. to which you said no. so you lied to me – and you have a proven history of lying and recording calls so unfortunately i’m no longer comfortable to take this call anymore. have a nice day.” ‘oh, what – you’re running away because you know i’m going to put you out of a job?’ ‘sorry?’ ‘scared! you’re fucking scared’ her, i assumed boyfriend, shouts from the background ‘you better be scared! we have fucking proof that you lied to us! you guys always lie, hence why we have to record these calls! you’ll be out on the street without a penny to your name, i’ll make sure of it.’ ‘sorry, but as the topic of this conversation now has little releve –‘ she cuts over me, making “blah blah blah” noises, mocking my obviously foreign accent. ‘that’s all i hear from you cunt’s, “blah, blah, blah”’ as her and her “boyfriend” laugh like a pair of elementary school bullies. at that point my blood was boiling so i terminated the call without another word. now this is where my apology comes into effect. this is one customer i could not forget about, one customer i could not brush off my shoulder. i sought revenge. as mention before, i had access to her mobile number, address – heck even her favourite color. so i made a note of them all on a bit of scrap paper and tucked it away for later that night. i searched the web for every text subscription service i could find, bonus points if they charged and signer ‘her’ up for it. i know our policy on these matters; “third party issue, customer will have to deal with the third party charging her”. so i made sure she where to receive at least 10 chargeable texts each and every day – making sure that she would rack up a phone bill, with a service provider who will provide no leeway with the payments. if she was going to try and scrounge me for $800 that could, and would affect my earnings then i was to make sure she didn’t have a penny left to her name. now it’s too days later and i’m completely guilt ridden. so i’m sorry for what i’ve done, i’m sorry i stooped to your level. but good god do i feel good about it.once a week for work, i load and unload a medium-sized truck of luggage (about eight feet high) for cruise ship guests at a three-star hotel. the luggage i unload was loaded previously by unionized longshoremen at a nearby dock, and the luggage i load goes back to them. last week, the luggage truck arrived completely full of luggage. the thing that sucked about this particular load? almost all of the bags were loaded with the wheels facing out, making it very difficult to pull bags out of the stack to unload (most bags don't have handles at the bottom near the wheels). unloading took a lot longer than usual. i showed the driver of the truck (let's call him joel) how it was all stacked as he was helping me, and he had my sympathy. then he talked about how much he loved delivering luggage for the longshoremen because he can't help unload or load for them because of union rules. then the wheels started clicking. together, we decided to load every piece of luggage with the wheels facing out, knowing it would be harder for them it is to unload under those conditions. later that day, i saw joel at the office and asked how it went. this is what he told me: "as the longshoremen opened the back door, they got really pissed off when they saw the bags with wheels facing out. the man in charge asked me who the idiot was that loaded all of these bags. i quickly replied, 'well, i did, cause that's how you guys loaded my truck this morning. i figured since you guys are the professionals, that was the proper way to do it.' "he quickly turned to his workers and barked at them to never load luggage that way again. i stood off to the side the whole time, smiling to myself while they unloaded the truck." i can contribute to the hell out of this. i was contacted by a client of mine with a problem. he'd been drunk and partying with some work colleagues and things got a little out of hand. he ended up hooking up with someone related to the case he was working on professionally, and someone stumbled across them mid-deed and took some photos .. very naked, very explicit, mid-coitous. worse still, this coming to light would have thrown the whole thing in jeopardy. the photos ended up on one of those revenge porn sites. i'm not sure whether it was his ex or someone intent on tampering with the case, but it didn't matter. i emailed the site hosting it and formally requested it be removed. the owner responded saying they don't do takedown requests and requested that i fornicate with myself. to be expected, which was fine because it was step 1. i pulled the whois information for the site to get the name of the company he was using to operate the site, then used public records to find out who he was. name, address, phone number, home address, then used social media to find his personal email address. i then used ip lookups to determine the company hosting it. i found photos of the girl and set up fake social media accounts for her as a 16 year old girl, with enough content that it would appear legit. i then contacted the domain registrar and his web host, saying that the site contained illegal child pornography and that this served as formal documentation that i had notified them of it, used an embedded 1px transparent png as proof they received it and read it, and they had seven days to de-register the domain, and delete the site or i'd be reporting them to the fbi and would be accessories after the fact to the distribution of child pornography. i did this on friday afternoon as both the domain registrar and web host's phone support was only weekdays. the site was deleted almost immediately, and the domain name suspended 45 minutes later. i called him on the phone using the info that i'd pulled, addressed him by name, and informed him that i would've liked to have made contact again by email, but unfortunately his email was not working, and neither was his web site. and that because of his failure to reply to a reasonable request, i had taken it upon myself to have it taken down for me, and that it would be in his best interests to pay attention to things i ask for in the future. his voice was shaking with a combination of fear and rage. "next time you to tell someone to go fuck themselves, make sure they can't fuck you instead." when the site finally re-emerged some time the following week, my client's sexy escapades had been removed from the site. i received a very nice bottle of scotch from the client, and logged the work on the ticket as 'web site maintenance'. close enough. edit: thanks op for making me remember this! i've added it to /r/talesfromtechsupport: as you might guess from my username, my ex is a compulsive hoarder. if you don't know what that is (or haven't seen a &amp; e or tlc us cable channels for the last few years) hoarding is the inability to dispose of objects, and the accumulation of objects to the point where it negatively affects one's life and the life of one's family. my ex is also an alcoholic, and cheated on me with 4 different guys. to make a long story short, we have an ugly custody battle. i think it's going to be a slam dunk, and it turns out not to be. the courts buy her "i have problems, but i'm getting help" routine. we end up splitting custody 50/50. my ex, from my perspective, is thumbing her nose at me and the courts. she shows up to pick up our kid with alcohol on her breath, and her house continues to be an absolute shithole. every time i send him with her, i die a little inside. fast forward a few months: my ex has my kid for the evening. i fall asleep on the couch. i awaken to my phone alerting me to a voicemail, at roughly midnight. i listen to it, and it's pretty apparently a butt-dial. i hear bar noises, and my ex's drunk voice. i hear a bartender say to my ex "you've been drinking for a while, huh", and she gives a slurred reply. i go into full on freak out mode. where is my 10 year old kid if she is at a bar getting loaded? i call the cops. i go to my ex's front door, knock, no answer. i beat on the door, and the cops shine their car search lights into her windows, no answer. i text my ex, asking where she is, and where our kid is. she says she's inside--hah, yeah, right, and you don't see the lights, or hear the pounding? eventually the cops leave, as they tell me they don't have probable cause to break the door down. 15 minutes after they leave, i see my ex's car pull-up. as i approach the car, i see her sitting there, doing nothing. the next thing i know, she puts her face into the steering wheel and passes out. i call the cops back. they return, and get her out of her car. to shorten the story, she eventually gives them her house keys, as she can't operate her own door lock. she's arrested for dui, and endangering the welfare of children. the cop tells me that he doesn't think the ewoc will stick, but he's willing to charge her with it, and let the da sort it out. a couple of weeks go by, my ex gets out of jail. i call the da handling my ex's case, and explain my situation, and what's been happening with my son. i plead with him that both charges need to stick, as the combination of her 2 duis (she'd had one earlier that year) and the endangerment charge would turn the tide of my custody fight. fast forward a few months: my ex has her meeting with the da and he plays hardball. she has to plead guilty to the dui, and the child endangerment charge, do 90-180 days in jail on the dui, probation on the child endangerment charge. it took a while,but with the help of the charges, i finally won my custody case. i move with my son to a great suburban school, and i've been busily re-building my own life and his. my ex sees my son every other weekend, and she has to do so at her parents' house, as her place is still a hell-hole. my ex is having difficulty finding work: she just lost her only job since this happened two years ago. she has no bank account, doesn't pay child support, and has trouble finding jobs when employers hear of her record. edit: changed a few spelling and verb tenses. also, once i got my ex's keys from her, i retrieved my son from her house. she had left him there, alone, while she went out to get loaded. **tl;dr**: ex leaves my kid alone in the house while she gets loaded. i have her arrested, and make sure the resulting charges stick. her life is shit now, but my kid is safe and happy.[this post]( reminded me of me. slighty different, because i destroyed my ex-wife's relationship with her entire family. when i was married, i tried to make it work. my ex will have a different story, of course, but my conscience is clean. i worked my ass off so we could get out of debt, i was there for her brother and sister when stepdad would go on a bender and hulk out when his frustrations got the best of him, i never hit her, and i never cheated on her. i really, truly tried to make it work. my ex had cheated on me once before, but i sincerely believe that people can change if they really want to. she was profusely and abjectly sorry, and promised to never do it again. i took her apology at face value, and life went on. i never brought it up again, not even in our worst arguments. but, having been burned, i remained vigilant. we had moved in with her mom to help out with her family's medical bills but moved out when those were under control and we were finally able to get ahead just a little. we had a little bit of disposable income, and a little bit more free time for ourselves. four years into our marriage, i noticed that she was "going out" a lot with "friends". "work" was demanding more of her time. she was coming home later and later. she was skipping out on eating our meals together. classic signs. i finally confronted her. one day, she told me she was going out with friends. again. i said it was fine. when her "friends" came to pick her up, i told her i wanted to meet them. "oh, we have to be somewhere at this time and we'll just make it if we leave now." i consider myself pretty laid back, but i took a hard line this time. "you're not going anywhere until i meet them." she knows she's caught. she goes out the door . . . and comes back with one guy. my heart rate shoots up, and i try to keep my rage under control. my dad was an old-school soldier, and he taught us *discipline*. you learn discipline real fast when screwing up means you get the belt. i have both of them sit down, she can't even look at me. i straight up ask, "are you her boyfriend? is she your girlfriend?" guy has a smirk-sneer on his face. "what do you think?" you know that saying "seeing red"? it's true. i saw red. i wanted to get my machete and go to town. but, *discipline*. you are better than they are. i control my breathing, take a deep cleansing breath. my voice is shaky. i point to her. "you, woman, if this is how you treat our marriage, then i want nothing to do with you." i point to the guy. "you. if she can do this to her husband, guess what she's going to do to you?" i point to the door. "both of you may now leave." the guy drops the smeerk off his face because he sees something in mine and both get up and scramble for the door. right before it shuts i can hear her yelling at him about how close he came to dying. i hear the car peel out a few seconds later. i lock the door and collapse down against it. &lt;emotions ensue.&gt; that night, she calls me up. she's getting her stuff and getting the fo of my life. i'm still messed up, so i say yes. i tell her i'll even stay out while she does this. fine, she says. the next day, i go out and do stuff. then i go do more stuff just to do stuff. when i get home, she's taken her stuff. she's also taken a shit ton's worth of my stuff. stuff that was sentimental to me but not to her, just to deny me that little bit more happiness. that's not right; that's just rubbing it in with a rake. i'm stone cold sober now, and i begin to plan. it takes a week, but end result: [i take her car.]( first person i called immediately after i got home was her mom. i told mil that we (her daughter and i) "couldn't be together anymore." mil tries to get more information, but i tell her to get it from her daughter and call me if she needs any more details. mil is cussing up a storm (not directed at me) when i hang up. a couple of days later, i got a call from her brother who is 6'1" and built like a brick shithouse. this is the guy who told me that if i ever hurt his little sister he would melt my dead body in acid so no one would ever find it. "bro, i'm sorry about what happened. if you need anything, just call." my mil has ten siblings. she told all of them, and all of them were solidly behind me. even the psycho aunt that nobody else in the family talked to. her cousins, nieces, and nephews called me up to offer support. it was immensely gratifying. karma: about a year later, i heard through a friend that bf got her pregnant then dumped her. a year after that, heard she was pregnant again from a different guy who also dumped her. **tl;dr** - wife cheats on me. her family backs me, not her.note: while some details of this story may seem fantastical, this is completely true, gentleman's honor. i have a friend whose job was to teach english in foreign countries. (often to adults) on this particular job, he found himself in saudi arabia. he would be teaching english on land owned by a sheikh, who was a wealthy community leader. before he had come to saudi arabia, he heard that this particular sheikh had hired sixty men from bangladesh for some sort of manual labor, and had refused to pay them. the men had tolerated this for a time, but eventually decided to strike, nothing violent, just a simple sit-down. however in saudi arabia, striking is illegal, so the sheikh deported all sixty men, getting months of free labor in the process. you can imagine that my friend was on his toes when he reached sa. he had been teaching for about a month now, and sure enough, his payday had come and gone, without being paid. he had visited the sheikh with his complaints, but he would just wave them off saying "inshallah!" which means "if god wills it" (essentially just a way to procrastinate.) after several more unfruitful attempts to get his money (keep in mind his paycheck was only 10,000 dollars, and this man was a multi-millionare) he was became fed up. he visited the sheikhs office, receives the customary "inshallah" and hands him a subpoena. turns out my friend had paid a visit to the american embassy and told them what was going on, the embassy was concerned, and set up a court date. now this was especially bad for the sheikh, who was friends with the higher-ups in the american embassy, and this would severely damage his reputation. but my friend wasn't done there. the sheikh was a devout muslim, (most people in that area were) so my friend directly quotes the qur'an, giving verse and chapter, saying: 'pay the worker while the sweat is still wet upon his brow' this was a major insult to the man, and he practically screamed my friend out of his office, threatening bloody murder. that was phase one the trial came and the sheikh appeared in court, it was a relatively simple case, and my friend got his money. this is where it gets interesting my friend (i've said that a lot) still had some time left to teach, but things were getting pretty ugly, and a powerful sheikh is not an enemy you want to have, so he decided to high-tail it back to the land of the free. the catch was that the sheikh had his passport. when you live on his land, and are paid by him, he essentially owns you, and it was policy to take the persons passport, and only give it back after escorting them to the airport to leave the country. so my friend started thinking deviously. he called his wife (safe in america) and asked for one of the families passports. once he got it, he visited the sheik's office and talked to his secretary (or whatever he was) the conversation went something like this. friend: you know, you people have cheated me and lied to me, and i bet you don't even have my passport! secretary: of course we have your passport! friend: so show it to me! secretary: no! i will not show you! friend: thats because you don't have it, you liar! eventually he got to see his passport, and after much cajoling, managed to hold it. he then proceeds (and i shit you not) to rub it all over his body, and act like he just found a long lost friend, all the while trying to switch it with his daughters passport, which was under his leg. he made the switch successfully, and after having the other passport snatched back with a cry of "you crazy american!" left with his passport. victory but he wasn't out of the woods yet, he drove to the small house he was living in, and packed everything he could into his car, he even bundled up the larger items on the roof rack. he then hopped in, and drove 1000 miles to the nearest airport. now comes the kicker my friend visited the closest american embassy (thank goodness for those) and reported a stolen passport! that last part had to be all caps, because of the magnitude of it. remember he had switched passports, his daughters passport was now in the sheikhs office, and it had no reason to be there. the embassy called the sheikhs office, and it went down (after the formalities) embassy: do you have the passport of a jane smith? (obviously not real name) sheikh: no, no, we have the passport of a john smith embassy: could you just check for me real quick? sheikh: (silence...then muffled arabic cursing) gotcha so not only did my friend tarnish this selfish, stingy bastards name at the embassy, he also framed him for the theft of a passport. and the punishment for theft in saudi arabia is dismemberment. i humbly pray your forgiveness for any grammatical errors (and just to put a few minds at rest, he was not dismembered)disclaimer: i read this on a russian forum and i'm translating it here. i have no way to verify whether this is true or not. but you guys liked the last story, so here’s another one. it’s good to have an oligarch for a neighbor. 10 years ago we got shat on. not a metaphor. a large chicken farm decided not to bother with proper disposal of chicken shit, and started dumping it onto a field next to our tiny town. heavenly aromas filled the air. billions of flies bred and multiplied. the wagtails could barely fly from overeating. the toads were the size of cats and spent their nights yelling in a heavy baritone. skylarks stopped skylarking and walked like pregnant women. nature rejoiced. we, the stinking residents of the village presented an oppressed minority and a landing zone for the flies. i must shamefully admit that we attempted complain to the authorities forgetting the cardinal rule of russia – if you’re shat on, wallow in it. stinking townsfolk called the authorities in the spring. the authorities finally came. on christmas. the authorities noted that there are no flies at 20 bellow. and it doesn’t smell too bad. that means that townsfolk are liars and if they don’t like the smells of the country, they should go to the city and not bother the chicken factory, who are creating jobs and feeding people. i restrained the urges to resort to criminality. i dreamt of arson, land mines, and murder. my conscience won, and i didn’t resort to terrorism. help came when it was least expected. the next spring, a moscow banker, simon, divorced his wife and moved nearby to live in his country mansion. the flies, not having class sensitivity, landed on the banker, and the smell wafted into his “cottage”. simon, surprised, came by to my house. --max, he said. i have a question for you. what’s with the flies and the stink? and the frogs at night? what’s going on? --chickens. --explain yourself. --nothing to explain. see that truck? --yeah. --it brings shit to the field from the chicken factory. a dozen times a day. --how long has this been going on? --since last year. --those bitches! wanna have some fun? simon made a call. an hour or so later, two carloads of his security staff, and we were in the back of his maybach. the cavalcade was off, as it turned out, not too far away. security stopped the next truck, kicked out the driver, and commandeered the vehicle. the procession started again. --simon, where are we going? --we’re going for a visit. --to whom? --the chicken owner’s house. so, we came to a neighboring town and stopped at a 4 story villa. the truck backed into the beautifully ornate cast iron gate, and dropped its shitty contents in a large, conical pile. it was smelly. simon exited his mayback, and covering his nose with a silk hanky approached the pile of poop. he dropped his pearly white business card on top of the pile – if the owner wants to chat, he’ll know where to find me. the very next day there were several bulldozers in the fields, covering the chicken shit with earth. okay, so i am a bouncer. proof: username. tl;dr dude tried to burn down the bar. got his ass whooped and thrown in prison. titties. some people haven't been enjoying my stories where i have to hit a guy or throw them out forcefully. so here's a story that just wrapped up, and it was taken into the hands of the law. i've been waiting to tell this story, and the ending just happened so here it is. a few months ago it was a regular friday night. i was off for the first night in a long time, so i decided to get "i'm going cow tipping" drunk. so as i'm working on my goal of complete inebriation, i see some of my coworkers breaking up a scuffle. for those that have never been a bouncer before, you can't get out of bouncer mode once you've been one. so i went to help them break up the fight. my coworker d-wreck has this dude in a headlock and threw him out the front door. the guy was yelling that he was going to whoop our ass and stuff, but fuck him, we know the drill. about 30 minutes later me and d-wreck are standing outside talking when we see the same guy inside the bar. (the dancefloor is outside, so it's possible to hop the fence and guardrails). well d-wreck, being very pro-violence and from alabama, goes and headlocks this dude again, albeit more violently. we tell him that he's banned from the bar and if we ever see him on the premises again, we'll have one of the cops on duty at the bar take him to jail. he says we'll regret this. we brush it off, and wrap the first few feet of our dicks around our waist again. it's about 1:30 a.m. at this point and i'm pretty hammered. low and behold we see fuckface in the bar again. but this time he's got something in his hand. d-wreck, steaming through his sweet alabama nostrils starts stomping his way. all of the sudden i see a small flame fly through the air. this mother fucker jumped back over the fence with a molotov cocktail, and threw it at the bar. luckily, he hit just a corner of the bar that no one was in. he almost hit a few people, but nobody got burned. d-wreck immediately tackles the dude and headbutts him when he gets him on the ground.. imagine a more redneck edge from wwe spearing this guy and then headbutting him, that's what it looked like. it was badass. 2 of the other bouncers on duty grab fire extinguishers and put the fire out before it gets too big. the whole thing took a total of maybe a minute. d-wreck has this dude with his arms behind his back, and brings him to the police who take him to jail. d-wreck was not happy. this mother fucker came into his bar and tried to kill people. well low and behold, the fire marshal called a few days later, and wanted statements from everyone working that night. this dipshit was getting tried for arson. d-wreck about shit a brick in happiness. it was his time to get revenge on this fucker who decided to make our lives hell. all the bouncers on duty gave statements to the fire marshal. if you didn't know, the fire marshal has more power than anyone. he can fuck you up. well i found out yesterday, that ole fuck face got 8 years in prison. this motherfucker tried to burn people alive, and the judge was not pleased about that. play with fire, and you're gonna get raped. in jail. afterwards, our bosses gave us all free shots. i then went home, caught whiskey dick and puked in my girlfriend's bed. solid night.my former uncle bob was a dead beat. why my aunt married him, is a mystery. he was an alcoholic, and a pervert to the extreme. he couldn't hold down a job, and was a terrible father. not only that he was always in the trouble with the law for some reason. well this happened quite some time ago (think 20~ years back) in a small town in the middle of no where where the sheriff also had the same high regard for bob. well bob was renowned for peeping into bathroom windows for a bit of voyager action. however one night he decided he'd peep in on my cousin taking a shower. not only was this perverted, wrong, and illegal, it was within the family! unfortunately for bob my other uncle tom was walking home when he spotted bob grazing through the bathroom window, and he could hear the shower running so he knew bob was peeping his daughter. well unfortunately for bob, tom is quite a large man, he works construction. for every ounce of strength tom has bob lacks. tom grabbed bob and for the next several minutes pummels him into submission, punches to the face, gut, throwing around, just a general quality beat down. of course this all speculation, as the police report was quite different. the after math was not pretty, broken nose, cracked eye socket, broken ribs, and plenty of blood over both men. of course the sheriff who is well acquainted with bob is called in. the sheriff arrives a few minutes later and sees bob on the sidewalk obviously in pain and he sees tom it's obvious there was a fight. so the sheriff walks up to tom and says "what happened here" tom starts to go off and the sheriff stops and says "now tom it appears to me as if bob came over and tripped? is that what happened?" to which tom responded indeed it was. the sheriff turned around looked at bob and said "bob, it appears as if you tripped and fell and i'm going take you the hospital" bob learned his lesson, recovered, was divorced, and we haven't seen him since (after the divorce, he limped around for awhile after that)thought i'd share my tale: back in january, my friend and i drive to our local mcdonalds. so we are sitting in drive-thru lane 2, waiting for our order to be taken, when i feel my car inch forward. i didn't have on the e-brake, so i thought maybe i forgot to put my foot on the brake pedal. crunch ... crunch "what the fuck!" i look behind me and some fuckass in an envoy is ramming my bumper (i drive a small hyundai coupe). so i throw my car in gear and pull into a parking spot just past the lanes, friend and i get out, see my bumper marked up like hell, and proceed towards this fucker's truck. as i get closer, i notice this guy's envoy is half in the lane and half in the flower bed, and i can hear the dude keep trying to drunkenly speak into the mic to order. i finally see the guy and my god he was massive (easily 6-3/6-4, 250lbs+). also, he was shirtless (real winner, right?). i get to his window and my buddy walks around the guy's car for whatever reason (tell ya in a second), and i pull out my phone to take notes, get a phone number... *keep in mind that this asshole is insanely drunk, sitting in the drive-thru lane throughout this conversation. i tend to approach the type gingerly, as to not get my shit wrecked by a dude that has a good 80lbs or so on me. and though i was pissed as fuck i probably would've taken it easy on the guy had he been cooperative. "yeah, i'm gonna need to get some information from you. pull up and we'll try and work something out, alright?" "my...name is jason." "okay, my name is _________. what's your phone number? do you have your insurance card or anything?" "....." the guy rolls up the window and drives away, as i'm like jogging behind him screaming obscenities. fuck so now i'm burger-less with a beat-up car, and some dick just pulled a hit-and-run on me. god fucking dammit. end up calling the cops, and one car with two officers show up about five-six minutes later. i give them the run-down on the guy's looks, kind of truck, color of it, etc. "did you get a tag number?" ah well shit, i didn't. my friend hears this and comes around with his phone, with a picture of "jason"'s tag (mahnigga.jpg). the second cop runs the tag number, and it doesn't match the envoy. fucking. great. fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck. the cop that ran the tag just goes back to sit in the car while the other finishes up with me. unfortunately for me, "jason" was probably long gone. i had a bogus tag number, a pretty vague description of the guy, no information besides what was probably a fake name, and an envoy to go on. no insurance info; not shit. so if i reported it to my insurance at this point, it would've been like i fucked my car up myself. great anyway, the cop and i are about to finish up with the scene and he's taking down some of my own information when the second cop gets out of the car. "hey, what was that tag number again?" -reads out tag number -second cop points to the drive-thru -"son. of. a. bitch." the dumbass had come back like, fifteen minutes later, with the cops and myself still there, to the drive-thru for his burger. cops acted quick, pulled him outta the truck, searched him and the truck, and put him in cuffs. truck was towed. "jason" scored a minor in possession, hit-and-run, whatever the charge is for having a bogus tag, and a dui charge. his parents were nice enough to pay me some cash for my car (which i gladly accepted and finished paying my car off), and i decided not to press any further. the state is gonna have a lot of fun with him, so why should i bother? i owe a lot to my friend for being so proactive in documenting the scene. he's received plenty of beers for the act since. and the cop said i was the luckiest dude he'd ever seen. i'd agree. kids, if you're in a fender-bender, take pictures of that shit. hope you enjoyed! sorry i'm a shitty storyteller. creative writing was never my thing.this story just came recently in from my friend in korea. he started working at a consulting firm, which specialized in helping foreign businesses enter the korean market. they also claimed to be experts at seo. when he told me about this job i googled the company. what i found shocking was if i typed the name of the company into google it was several pages until i found there website. i thought to myself...how the fuck does a company who says they are marketing genius unable to make their website shows up on the first page of a google search for their name. also they had offered my friend a very high salary of $8,000 per month which was unusual and very high. and i asked my friend to dig into this company and see whats up. i left it there, well my friend didn't. he did some digging and discovered that the company was funneling money from the korean army from into his bank account then laundering. my friend thought to himself "i really need this $8,000 so i'll stick around" my friend didn't particularly care that this company was breaking the law. he just wanted his money. but in the mean time he did some digging and found some proof. guy was basically funneling 150-200k a month through this company. his employees where just a front. then came payday...and guess who didn't get paid? my buddy!!! he approached his boss and basically said "pay me" guy kept beating around the bush. my friend set a deadline 10 days after payday he was to be paid or he was going report this company (he didn't threaten the last part) and come the 11th day he contacted a government agency specializing in fraud investigations, he walked into their office and dropped off all the evidence and proof he had. which was substantial. everything from receipts, to emails, etc he had everything. long story short my buddy former boss went to prison. he was ordered to pay back all the money he had stolen. and guess who stole it? his business partner who they haven't be able to locate (they suspect he went to china) and now not only does he have a prison sentence. he also has a judgement of about $1.5 million dollars from the korean government...korea still has debtor prisons. my friend confided in me his game plan was to get that $8,000 and then quit and forget this company ever existed. just some added info it was a company of 4 people * ceo * hot sectary (who apparently the ceo was banging) * 2 senior marketing executives (one of them was my buddy) heres the thing...those 2 senior "executives" one of whom was my friend...didn't have any marketing experience or education. one of them didn't even speak korean![you need to read them meme as well]( figured you all might enjoy. before you wonder, maybe she was going slow in the fast lane or maybe she was driving like an idiot. i was going 65 in a 60 in the right hand, slow lane. i had gotten over after passing another vehicle to let the cars coming up behind me pass with out having to slow down. i am a considerate driver. my low profile (lp) friend was on the end of line of the cars coming up on me when i got over. he wanted to pass them on the right without knowing i was there. i suppose that was my fault along with the cars to the ~~right~~ left of me slowing down to my speed due to a cop coming from the opposite direction. anywho, for about 2 miles extreme tailgating persisted. our group of 6 cars got clogged up in stoplights and other traffic. 3 of the cars turned off in various directions leaving 3. we get up to a good stretch and back up to speed. at this point the guy next to me, the original truck in front of him had had enough of him zig-zagging between the two lanes tailgating either one of us. he would speed up to pass me, lp would jump behind him, and he would slow down. i did remain at a consistent 65 mph so lp would jump behind me… etc. i noticed the board in the road. it was sitting perpendicular across the lanes, about 1/4 in the left lane and 3/4 s in my lane. i had about 10 seconds to decide… to be a jackass or not be a jackass. i decided on the ~~later~~ former. i waited till the last possible second. swerved my suv right, just as he was going back to the left lane to harass the truck. bam he hits it. i heard it. a satisfactory smile crept across my lips and my truck friend realized what i had done. he sped up with lp right on his ass. lp rolls down his window flicks me off, pulls out in front of me, brake checks, and speeds off. i was expecting all this. a quarter mile down the road his flashers go on and he pulls over to the e-lane with a flat tire. i slowed as i went by him, rolled down my window, smiled and waved. tl; dr: traffic can be frustrating. if you drive like a jackass people will treat you as such. edit: had to change a right to a left. see strike through.so this happened over the course of several years. backstory- i played golf for a university and was fortunate enough to have a scholarship that paid for me to go to school. back in the summer of 2004 i was arrested for a dui. i blew .09 when the legal limit is .08 bac. i didn’t know any attorneys where i lived (went out of state for school) but i had a very dear friend that thought he could help me out. i was referred to a guy i will call tom (name changed). i paid tom $1500 dollars to handle my dui, and he said that was the friends and family discount and i figured i would be in good hands. a couple months later being an idiot kid (i say kid even though i was 23 at the time) i got pulled over again and was driving on a suspended license. car impounded ticket etc. my coach was not pleased and i was removed from the team. to this day i do not blame my coach. he made the right decision. i ended up having to leave school and move home as i could not afford to stay without my scholarship. the above is important because tom, being the attorney of record got all of my notices to appear in court, and was required to appear on my behalf since i no longer lived in the state. over the next couple of years i found out on three or four occasions that i had a bench warrant for my arrest for failure to appear in court. i knew nothing about having to appear due to the fact that i was not receiving any of the notices and tom was not showing up to get my simple dui taken care of. another year passed and the dui was still not settled. i was moving on with my life and had finally got a good job working as a recruiter for a national company, life was looking up and i was enjoying the work. after about a month at the new job my supervisor pulls me into the conference room and informs me that the company had run its mandatory background check and asks me why there was a bench warrant out for my arrest in another state. i inform him of the dui (for those that may ask, in the application it asked if i had been convicted of any felonies- technically the dui was not settled, and a first dui is rarely ever considered a felony.) and he tells me that due to their insurance company not being willing to cover me i would be let go and that day would be my last day. i was defeated. it had taken me months to get that job and get out of waiting tables. i called tom to see what the absolute fuck was going on with my case and how i had yet another bench warrant out for my arrest. he dodged my calls for days. i started keeping call logs on when i called, if i was able to reach him etc. but it was to no avail. he basically disappeared. the revenge- i started looking into what it would take to file a complaint with the state bar association. this is not a simple process, and you have to be able to prove the attorney was negligent in how they were handling your case. fortunately my mother was a stringent records keeper for matters like this, and had the call records for the last several months along with the minimal documentation, contracts etc from when we hired tom. we filled out what seemed like an endless supply of forms for the complaint and sent everything we had to the state bar association. it took several months but once the bar association looked into the case they wrote to inform me that they had suspended tom’s license from practicing law for 10 years in that state and he would not be able to appeal it for 5 years. they also refunded me the $1500 that i had paid him which went to hiring a new attorney. the new attorney was great and was able to get the matter resolved within 6 months. but she did tell me that when she appeared before the judge he was visibly upset at me due to how tom had handled the case. i was not given any leniency and got maximum fine amounts and 3 years unsupervised probation. all totaled it took almost 4 years to get my dui case settled in court. my probation has been over and done with for a while, but i still smile knowing that tom is still unable to work in his primary profession. and for those wondering, i do still drink, but when i do i drink responsibly and take a cab. tl:dr don’t do your job which results in getting me fired from mine. i will make sure you cant work in your profession for 10 years. i've debated if this counts as pro revenge since i literally didn't have to do anything, but i think it'll still fall under the category. i've mentioned in a past post "don't wish bad on other's, wish good on yourself." this is a prime example. after college, the recession had started up and jobs were severely limited. i ended up taking an entry level call center job for retirement plans which is quite possibly the worst hell you can imagine. i was talking to 80 yr old women during the stock market plummets and had to tell them what happened to their life savings. it was heart shattering. you also experience the worst of the genetic toilet, and that's where this one caller i'll name "big mac" falls in. i was called at 9 am by an older man who demanded to speak with my friend (who was a manager in training). my friend wasn't going to be in until 9:30 am, so i told him and offered to either transfer to his voicemail, take a message and email him personally, or transfer him to whatever manager was available. ill call my friend bob big mac: you're not *listening.* i'm *telling you* to transfer me to bob right now. me: ...i understand you want to talk to bob, but he doesn't get in for another half hour. it's literally physically impossible to transfer you. big mac (or bm) didn't comprehend this. stating it was absurd that he was on vacation in florida (he lived i think in jersey) and he had to call and couldn't talk to bob and just kept bitching in general. i offered numerous times to help him myself or any of the other options i gave him earlier. he became more irate bm: now you listen to me. you make *sure* bob calls me before he has his first cup of coffee. *do you understand me??* me: ok. (staying calm, i mentally checked out on this dude after the 3rd time explaining bob wasn't there) bm: now listen *very* closely. if bob doesn't call me when he gets in, i'm going to my local mcdonald's and shooting up the place and i'm going to blame *your company* and- me: sir, *sir* we're on a recorded line i really ask you *not* to joke about murder bm: you have no idea how serious i am at the exact moment i spoke...bob was walking by me. me: ok. we hung up within 20 seconds. me: i really hope i never have to deal with a dude like that again (here's where the wish comes into play) bob: that guy sounded pleasant. now...what's this about "joking about murder?" i told him and within 20 minutes, they called bm's local police and arrested him (in jersey. calling from florida, huh?) the police later told me when they arrested bm, he was yelling that he was going to sue the cops, his town and state, my company and most of all *me* for slander. he continued to yell and deny until he was sat down in the police station and was played the phone call. the cops tell me bm immediately burst into tears and begged for forgiveness and that he didn't mean it. this was immediately 5 minutes after he maintained his stance on denying allogations and suing everyone. i ended up talking to bm once more two weeks later. much more sheepish than before and ended the call by telling me how much he appreciated my service (he recognized my name and voice and knew i was the same guy). like i said, don't wish bad on others, wish good on yourself. if a wish comes true one helps you more than the other. plus karma's a bitch.i've heard this story from a few sources. it seems, though, that over the years the number of people that claim that they were "actually in the truck at the time" have increased to circus clown car proportions. when i asked him about it, mark (not his real name) said he was driving his pickup full of friends in a grocery store parking lot when a car abruptly backs out, forcing him to stop short. then after snailing along for about 10 s, a man exiting the store, yells out "hey angela! how are you?" this lady proceeds then to actually stop her car, exit the vehicle, and leave her car door open blocking both lanes of the parking lot now to go visit with her friend. after about 5 steps, mark yells out "hey angela! how about you come back here and move your car?" she turns around and asks "how do you know my name?" he replies "i just heard that guy yell it over there. now how about moving your car?" a vehicle has also pulled up behind him so he can't even back out now. she goes "oh, fuck you, you asshole" , then walks over to her friend and begins chatting with him. my friend stews for a moment and then guns his truck right through her driver side door ripping it off it's hinges. he yelled "fuck you too angela!" as he peeled out of the parking lot. **tl:dr** lady blocks parking lot with her open car door. friend drives through said door like a crazy person. english is not my first language. ignore the grammar issues, please **tl;dr version.** was very good friends with boss and female co-worker/friends. they had an affair together and took my honesty and friendship and respect and shoved it in my face. i got back by waiting a full year and ratting them out to their spouses causing them to get divorced. **wall of text version:** so a few years ago i worked at a fortune 100 company. i was there on a contract. everything was great. really liked the team, boss (paul) was great. he and i could talk about anything honestly as two guys. he's been to my house. i've been to his. his wife is funny and a stay-at-home mom. if it wasn’t for the boss/contractor thing we could be bros outside of work. at some point there is a new woman contractor (mary) that starts on the team. she sits in the cube next to me. she's married, pretty hot, a little bit flirty, just generally great too talk to. she and i hit it off right away. we become pretty close, texting each other at night about work and family and just general shit. every now and then she throws some random comments out there about me coming over to her place. which, from a self-esteem point of view, was just a big plus in my book. never took her up on it, but could have. we have our normal disagreements about how to run stuff, complete tasks, etc. and while those got heated, it was just two strong willed people having differing opinions. no big deal. she becomes a family friend. our kids play together, families go to events together, etc. fast forward to about 4 months later, i am chatting with my boss late at night (project cutover), he mentions that he is jealous how mary and i can “fight and clear the air and just move on”. i thank him for the compliment and didn't think anything of it. well within a couple of weeks boss-man and mary are doing lunch together constantly. i ask him if i should "move out of the way" as it is obvious that he likes her. (remember i am there on a contract, so my boss can fire me without a reason – that why i treated him with deference) he says no. life goes on for another couple of weeks this way. then he puts her on his pet project. all of her time is now allocated to his stuff. he doesn't have time for the rest of the team as "all of his attention is focused on his project" i am sure you can see where this is heading. it was quite obvious to the entire group that they were having an affair. the entire group was up in arms about this because this "new" girl is getting all of the boss’s attention, getting perks, etc. same old story that you have heard about before. needless to say i too am upset. i am losing my bff. i figured we were friends enough to keep being friends even through her affair. obviously not. what bugged me about the entire thing is that i told my boss (who was also a friend) that his affair with her was ruining my work relationship and my personal relationship with mary. he denied to my face that they were having an affair. which was such bs, because i overheard him talking to her on the phone saying how he wanted to come over to her place for one of their “status meetings” and make out with her. (side note: there were also a couple of photos of them that were taken by people on the team - one was taken in the office at a group celebration for someone’s birthday, in the background you can see them in his office with his hands on her ass, and another one where the team was out to a concert everyone was drinking. people finally noticed that they disappeared. one of the women in the group took a pic of them kissing in his car) of course i didn't tell them about these pictures during our talk. fuck him and her. less than a month later we do a shuffling of cube locations, "to better align the people who work on projects together". i am moved to a “deserted island” - no one around me. handwriting is on the wall. one month after that i am cc'd on an email to my contracting firm informing them that my last day will be 2 weeks from that email. so through this whole thing, my "friend" just quit hanging out (and i get why). didn't give a shit anymore. pretty much just dumped me as a friend. i didn’t like it. i tried to ask her why, to see if she would say anything at all-- no dice. her allegiance was to paul now. i told her that i was upset. she told me she didn't care and didn’t have time for me. fuck it. if you want to have an affair go for it. the whole affair part didn't bother me (too much). i will admit to some envy there, but i am not going to sacrifice everything i have for some ass. just not worth it to me. what bothered me was the lack of respect that they both showed me. i was pretty honest with both of them about what the team was saying, how everyone was feeling, etc. what they did was take my honesty and use it so that they could cover up their affair better. for example, when i said that people were noticing that she would leave and then paul would get his coat on and leave within 5 min, he started leaving his coat in the office and leaving about 15 min after her. when i said that people noticed that he was giving gifts to her and not to the group then all of a sudden the group started getting stuff too. crap like that. what was funny (in a fucked up way) is that about 4 months after i was gone she started being friendly again, random "how are you?", "my day sucked" texts. anyway, i moved on work-wise. still texted her every few days after she started texting me. again, nothing major. just pleasantries. i liken the ups and downs of our friendship to "being rich", then "being poor". i would much rather be "rich" again. who doesn't right? but that anger was still inside me because of how vulnerable i made myself to her and how i felt i was used. so i resolved to get even. i waited a full year (and heard that she had accepted a full time position with my former boss). i then sent an anonymous email to his wife letting her know about the affair, and giving her details and the proof (the pictures) too. mary of course called me, so did my former boss. he was pissed! i told both of them that i did not do anything ("how could i, i have been gone for more than a year. i don't know anything about your life anymore!”) fuckers. i heard that both of them got tossed out of their homes and are getting divorced. they deserve each other. moral of the story, if you are going to have an affair be discreet and keep your friends close. or have the balls to say "i don't want to be friends anymore" and not be a passive-aggressive douchebag. because if not, they may become your enemy and might be even more passive-aggressive and look for revenge. did it make me feel better that i did it? fuck yes. i'll be around if you have questions. this is a throwaway account so feel free to ask, or criticize or whatever. didn't know this sub existed, so cross posting now. this began approximately 3 weeks ago and culminated last saturday. two of my friends from college now stay close and live in the same city. since we graduated, we all stayed close by hanging out, drinking, and most of all by pulling pranks on each other. it started as rather innocuous escapades; changing out someone's entire apartment furnishings with ugly curbside furnishings/thift store, moving each others cars while we were at work, etc... of course a sort of escalation came into play with the pranks becoming more elaborate and slightly twisted (the two of them hired a transvestive to agressively hit on me at a bar we frequent and then payed her to stalk me for a week). it always made for good laughs, most of the time. at this point i should introduce the two devient bastards i call friends. 'gérard' as we shall call him, is from a well off family and kind of a dick and 'edmond' is a bit more reserved and busts his ass working at the county morgue. i only give the background on them because it is sort of integral to what happened. leading up to a few months ago, gérard started becoming a little too aggressive with pulling one over on edmond to the point where it was painfully obvious that things were getting a little too mean spirited. we talked about it a few times and gérard always just played it off like it was no big deal. however, the pranks continued and just the generally verbal ribbing he gave edmond was just too much for the guy to take. after work one day edmond and i are drinking bourbon at my house and he tells me that he is sick of gérard's shit. he then lays out his devious plan to put him in his place. i, realizing the amazing crown jewel that he has plotted, agree to assist. a few weeks later, the three of us are at the bar and this beautiful blonde comes over and starts falling all over gérard. unbeknownst to him, it is actually a cousin of edmond who had been enlisted to the plot. she eggs on to drink vigorously until the bar kicks all of us out. we, already planning to stay with at gérard's place due to his close proximity to that part of town, get back and keep him drinking. at this point the poor fellow is blackout drunk and it doesn't take long for him to pass out with his head in the toilet. collectively, we move the victim into his bed and get to work. edmond and his cousin begin applying makeup to her. first, they take her down to her underwear and then apply a very pale foundation to her entire body. she takes on a very palor appearance before edmond places a fake neck wound from a costume store on her neck. next, edmond bring in a cooler with several pints of real fucking blood. at this point, i didn't even want to know the how's or whys but i kept rolling with it. after a few hours of waiting around, all of our nerves frayed from waiting by his door hoping he did not wake up and throw a wrench into out plans, we laid the finishing touches. edmond's cousin crept into gérard's room and played in his bed. edmond then cut open the blood bags and covered gérard, the girl, and a kitchen knife (from gérard's kitchen of course). at this point the sunrise had fully illuminated the room when i left and edmond stayed behind. suddenly, i hear edmond cry out "gérard! what the hell have you done!". an audible groaning could be heard from the bedroom as the still drunk gérard started out of his slumber followed by a stream of expletives from the newly faux murderer. i rush into the room on cue to release my own stream of expletives and to grab gérard (no reason to give him too much time to contemplate the situation). i usher him into the living room and sit him down to calm him down. right now would have been the perfect time to end this charade and make it a story we could all have laughed about, however, edmond was not done with his prey. he comes out of the bedroom to tell gérard that the girl is dead. the hysterics coming from our 'murderer' are endless. edmond kneels down to eye level and slaps him across the face and tells him to get it together because he is going to have to call the police. gérard reacts to this by freaking out and begging the two of us not to do that. masterfully, edmond pretends to deeply contemplate the poor man's pleas and then says "i can take care of this for you, but you have to commit to it. never say a word about this to anyone. ever!" i, on cue again, escort gérard to the shower, take his clothes and tell him to clean all traces of blood from himself. edmond and i then go inside of the bedroom and wrap his cousin into a blanket. as we hear gérard exit the shower, we pick up the girl and carry her to the bed of my pickup truck (with a cover) outside. when he sees us carrying the mass of cloth and body he freaks out into hysterics again. i we spend the rest of the morning cutting up carpet, moving the mattress, and bleaching walls and floors. all the while stopping to console our terrified friend. at many a point we could have stopped and revealed our ruse to gérard and perhaps we should have. however, edmond was not yet done with him. the following weeks were not good for gérard. the three of us hung out still, but no longer did we go out and the would be murderer constantly checked the news for a missing person or a body turning up somewhere. he once pressed edmond for details of what we did with the evidence only to be met with a stern "its better if you didn't know". fast forward to last saturday evening with the three of us sitting in gérard's living room. he begun coming out of his state of shock and would talk to us more about the normal things we guys bullshit about on a regular night. coincidentally, it was also the night that edmond layed his final stroke. after finishing a beer, gérard stood up and turned to get another from the kitchen other end of the house where a pair of glass doors lead out to the back deck. standing on the deck was none other than edmond's cousin in her blood stained pallor with a cheap faux neck wound staring back at him. instantly, the haunted victim began pointing and screaming to which edmond and i started uncontrollably laughing. gérard was too enshired in his fear to notice our reaction for several minutes as he continued his hysterical response curled up on the floor. at this point the game was finished. we let the would be spectre into the house and explained the masterfully laid prank on our friend. instantly, the fear turned to rage and he threatened to kill us as he ran the three of us out of his house. neither edmond or i have been able to get gérard to talk to us since. tl;dr we made our friend think he killed someone and then haunted him with his perceived victim notes: i do not know the origin of the blood. i do know, from my experience growing up on a farm, that the blood passed the cursory olfactory test. i do not go into detail about why "gerard" deserves this, mostly because i do not have "edmond" consent for that. it does cross work and family boundaries that we all had, until recently, respected.us army, 2006. i was in advanced training (where you go after basic training to learn your actual job) and there was a "problem individual" in our barracks bay (room of 20 beds). he was being discharged for "failure to adapt" and was prolonging it as long as possible to milk the pay he was getting from the army, which he kept referring to as "the easiest job he's ever had." the bay had 10 bunk beds and one single bed, he got the single bed because nobody wanted to be near him. he did stuff like the following * walked around claiming to be black (clearly not) to groups of black soldiers, because his adopted mother is black. * used "nigger" as a greeting to black soldiers while flashing what he probably thought were gang signs but looked like he was having a seizure. * walked around with his laptop on his shoulder playing rap music from it like it was a 1980s boombox. * talked loudly in his sleep, mostly creepy sex stuff including the names of specific soldiers in the bay. * incessantly bragged about how he could kick everyone's ass, but screamed for the drill sergeant like a child crying for mommy if anyone got physical with him. all that crap we could ignore because he was on his way out and we thus had no responsibility to try to help him improve, but one thing he wouldn't do was secure his locker. he'd always leave it unlocked, and the whole bay would get punished for having an unsecured locker. he'd also throw a raging fit if you closed his lock when he wasn't around, because "you touched his stuff." as such we never referred to him by name, he was simply "the douchebag." i was one of the "brainy" soldiers, so the drill sergeants would pull me off of the work details to do paperwork for them. i didn't mind trading 3 hours of gardening in the sun for 4 hours of paperwork in an air conditioned office, i probably would have done better in the air force than i did in the army. while doing paperwork, i overheard that there was going to be a full locker dump inspection the next morning. that night i went to the little convenience store across from the barracks and made an unusually large purchase from the hygiene aisle. the next morning, the drill sergeants storm through the barracks, room by room, dumping the contents of everyone's lockers to check for contraband. mine is dumped, of course no problems. my bunk-mate's is dumped, no problems. then it's time for the douchebag's locker. at first, it's trash. he was too lazy to actually throw his trash away, so he just threw it on top of his other stuff. candy wrappers (you're not supposed to eat in the barracks), empty tiny bottles of alcohol (drinking not allowed in training), dirty clothes so nasty the drill sergeant kept rubbing his hand on his pants after touching them. with each infraction the drill sergeant gets angrier and louder, but the douchebag knows that if they try to give him serious punishment that he'll be there even longer. the drill sergeant then grabs the backpack hanging on the locker door, pulls it open and turns it over on the bed. out spill a half-dozen douches, half of them new in their box and half of them out of the box with their contents emptied. the drill sergeant stops yelling mid-sentence and just stares. the douchebag is confused until he picks one up of the packages and reads what it is. he explodes. he's screaming that they're not his, he's throwing the bottles at other soldiers who are at parade rest waiting for their locker inspection, ripping the sheets off his bed, and he's even kicking his own stuff on the floor. the drill sergeant just watches as he ragingly stomps on the stuff on the floor in his temper-tantrum, up until the moment he realizes he just brought his foot down through his laptop. then his rage turns to despair as he cradles this laptop like it's a dying child, crying and screaming in full meltdown. the drill sergeant watches for about another minute, then loudly says "carry on" and exits the bay. and no, he didn't start securing his locker after that.making a throwaway for this, had to get it off my chest to someone after so many years.. where do i even begin.. my parents were immigrants from latvia. dad was a physicist, he passed away when i was 5, my brother 2, and since then mom struggled to earn for our living, it was rough. before that mom was a housewife, taking care of us full time, so she had no big education or work experience. so she turned to cleaning, cooking and babysitting for our neighbors in the community. after some time we couldn't afford to pay rent on time, and that's when i realized that we are in trouble, because the landlord was coming and shouting at my mother, she was crying, it happened several times. i helped as much as a kid can i guess, but that was not enough to keep us fed &amp; bring money. after several angry visits the landlord came with a friend, they were both drunk and they beat up mom and forced her to have sex, saying that they will harm me and my little brother. it was the most terrifying moment of my life, mom was hysterical and crying and didn't stand up for the rest of the day, we were crying with her and didn't understand what and why had happened. the landlord said he will come back after a week. he did that for over a year, coming back once or twice a week alone or with his friend. they didn't shout or beat mom up any more, and they locked me and my brother in the toilet so that we didn't see anything, but mom was crying very long after each time they came. mom was starting to get crazy then, she was talking to herself and crying several times during the day.. some time passed like this and the landlord began staying overnight, mom acted really crazy, she would beg him to stay in the morning, made him breakfast and all.. and gradually he was living with us, my mother treated him like dad and i had to pretend that i like him because every time he didn't like my behavior he would make mom shout and cry at night. my brother doesn't remember our dad at all, so our stepfather likes him more than me. anyway, back to the point, to make this whole mess even more rough, our stepfather has seizures sometimes, especially when he's drinking and doesn't take his medicine or vomits the tablets, it happens sometimes.. during those times he is unconscious for like 3 minutes and dancing all over the floor, anyway he doesn't remember anything. so when i was 9 years old i had so much hate for him boiling in me that i was planning ways to kill him before going to sleep. but i was afraid of doing anything like that, which would destroy our family even more.. so i was secretly dreaming of harming him, and this was especially strong when he was drunk or unconscious. i remember this like it happened today.. he came back home drunk late at night, we were all pretending that we are sleeping to avoid trouble, although he was very loud and stumbling &amp; banging on everything. at nights like this we were just silently hoping that he would collapse and sleep, and do no harm. and he did. after waiting the safe amount of time i was able to go to the toilet to pee, which was good.. in times when he was not drunk enough, me and my brother peed into empty soda bottles to avoid going to the toilet. so when i went to the toilet to pee, i saw him there, he was on the floor lying in his vomit with pants down and having a seizure, i was petrified, i thought he was sleeping with mom. but instead of waking mom up, i took a needle which he always used for picking his teeth and i stabbed him in the balls. i dipped the needle in his vomit and stabbed his balls for more than 2 minutes, i made sure that his vomit got into his balls. after that i put the needle back on the sink and went back to sleep feeling excitement and relief. of course he didn't remember anything the next day, but he was very very angry and sore and accused mom that she hit him in the balls when she was transporting him to bed in the morning. he stayed in being very pissed. after i came back from school i found out that the friend drove him to the hospital. well it turned out he got testicular gangrene, sepsis &amp; came back from the hospital several weeks later without balls and lacking a big chunk of meat around the area. those weeks were the best weeks of my life. also he stopped drinking after this, but he never stopped being an abusive asshole until he died when i was 24. never told anyone, not even my brother. **edit:** first of all thank you for not judging for what i did. i have had enough mental problems when i was a kid, i thought that i was a monster for what i did. fortunately the situation got much better when our stepfather came back from the hospital, he stopped drinking, was less aggressive and didn't disappear for days and come back beating us and mom. this helped me a lot to justify what i did, but again, i was not aware of the possible consequences when enacting my spontaneous revenge. i wanted to give him pain and a swollen sack, while he barely made it alive from what the doctors were saying. the doctors never told him about the needle marks, i think because of the swelling - i never got to see it but the friend driving him to the hospital told us that it looked like a plum, the size of a grapefruit.. he died of unrelated reasons when i was 24 - after he stopped drinking, food became his new addiction and he got really obese quickly. he had a fatal stroke. as for his friend, i never wanted revenge on him because when our stepfather disappeared (sometimes for days long), he came to us, gave mom food and money, he helped us to get through the rough times. i always thought that he was the good guy, at least in comparison to our stepfather. as for myself, i am doing fine, thank you for asking. i am happily married, my wife also was a victim of childhood abuse, so we understand each other on a level impossible for 'normals'. out of fear for reenacting the past, my wife and i made the decision to sterilize, did that last year, so no children possible for us, and that's fine. i often wonder how would my life go if my father hadn't died. i'd probably be a physicist or something. i'm working shifts. but now that all is fine, i think i can better appreciate this small fine life i have with my wife. all good stepfather, burn in hell.using a throwaway for this. it’s long so i hope it’s at least entertaining for you all... i work in it for a large company. a year ago we were a bit short staffed so we finally picked up a new coworker, we’ll call him chad. when i saw chad’s resume there were a few red flags, for example he had close to 10 different jobs in the past 5 years. for the first few days everyone was ok with him but after a few shifts we noticed a pattern… he would constantly browse gaming sites, go home for lunch so he could play with his games (which was fine since it’s his lunch break anyway), and after coming back from break he would have his ipad with him so that he can watch twitch after business hours (we work 12 hour shifts and the datacenter is pretty dead around 5:00pm). he was a pure video game addict. don’t get me wrong i am ok with people slacking off but i at least want them to learn how to do their job first so that they can be of help when needed. for the first 3 months my team tried our best to train him but he was way more focused on gaming than actually learning the job, he never retained anything we taught him because he just wasn’t interested. my team kept telling our manager about his lack of progress but our manager just chalked it up to us doing a horrible job of training him. when chad was 8 months into the job he still didn’t know how to do the basics that most people already pick up by the first week, and our manager still refused to fire him (most assumed that he didn’t have the balls to pull the trigger on it). at that point our team was already so fed up with chad that we just ignored him and gave up training him. our team is 24/7 so we cover for holidays but the company only wants 2 staff members max for holiday shifts because they don’t want to pay too much overtime. when the next holiday shift was coming up i volunteered for it with another coworker, i love the overtime pay and plus i didn’t want chad to work it because if something did blow up he would be useless (i worked holidays alone with chad before and i did all the work, really frustrating). this didn’t sit well with chad though and he brought it up to me. he told me it wasn’t fair that i was working more holidays than him and he wanted to work this next one, he also brought it up to my manager and i was pretty much forced to let him have it. i saw the smug look on his face as he rejoiced in his triumph… but deep down that was the last straw for me. i didn’t believe that this guy deserved to get overtime pay for a shift that i know he won’t be lifting a finger for so i felt like i had to get my revenge. i started browsing his facebook page to try to dig up dirt on this guy and turns out his fb was a goldmine. the guy always complained about work and made his status updates public so that i could see it without even being his friend. here are a few that i found: once i found these i forwarded screenshots to my coworkers and that eventually reached my manager. this woke my manager up and he was finally on a mission to get chad fired. the only tricky part was that chad’s facebook name was fake and he had no pictures of himself in his profile; the only reason i knew it was his facebook was because i always saw him on it during work. my manager decided to take a stab anyway and had a 1 on 1 meeting with chad and showed him the facebook page and asked him if it was his, as we predicted chad denied it all. after that meeting, my manager gave me the update that we don’t have enough evidence to fire him. i was so close to getting him that i didn’t want to let this bastard slip through. i searched his fb even more, found his wife’s fb page and sure enough her pictures were also public and it had quite a few pictures of chad tagged with his fb profile. nailed him. my manager brought up the pictures and chad had no choice but to admit it was him. he even had the balls to say to my manager “the only reason i lied about my fb page the first time was because i wanted to protect you (my manager) just incase this would bring trouble from hr”. he was fired on the spot. felt so good. **the aftermath** my manager still had to deal with chad a few times via e-mail afterwards. apparently after chad got fired he sent an e-mail to my manager’s boss saying how my manager made my team gather the evidence so that chad can get fired before he moves to the us… we didn’t even know he was moving to the usa, infact he always said how he hated that country so it was a surprise to us. he also sent an e-mail to my manager about how he found out he has cancer and since he doesn’t have a job he can’t afford the medical bills for it. not sure if chad was just lying about that to make my manager feel bad but i wouldn't put it past him. bonus picture, here is a status of him complaining about other people’s laziness when he himself is the laziest bastard i have ever worked with: **tl;dr useless coworker forced me to step down from working for overtime pay, i dug up dirt from his fb to get his ass fired.**so my now ex girlfriend *both of us are 18* cheated on me with a 32 year old married man who she works with. after nearly three years she goes and does this to me, right before final exams in college. i nearly failed out of college, and then she texts me and says "btw he's a better kisser than you" and goes on to mention how they fool around on work time. so i wanted revenge. i went to where she works and asked some of my friends that work there, and found out the guy's name. so i called the walmart, spoke to the manager, and in complete detail *that she gave me* described what they were doing on work time, and when he asked me to come down and show proof, i showed him the texts she sent me. they were making out, she was blowing him, etc on the clock, so he thanks me for letting him know and i leave. later i go on her facebook and see her status saying how she got fired. i checked at the walmart and found out the guy got fired too. you cheat on me after three years? you'll lose your job and your reputation will go down. i am considering exposing how much of a whore she is to her friends as well. suck on that you lying slut. edit: and stop asking for the tit pics!! look up porn like everyone else.my grandfather owned a rather large farm in a small farming community. he always got along well with the neighbors, that is until jim moved in. jim was someone that my grandfather had known from his time on a nearby police force. jim had approached him and asked him to sell a small parcel of land to build a house on. it was an inconvenience as my grandfather owned the land on three sides of this but he grandfather accepted and jim started to build. fast forward a few years, my father and grandfather continually found garbage dumped on their land. later that summer they also caught jim digging a duck blind in the middle of their field. that was the beginning of the end for the relationship. after several attempts of my grandfather being civil and jim continuing to dump garbage things were getting worse. it all came to an end one day when my father was driving through the field in a new combine and drove it right into another duck blind that jim had dug. now my grandfathers farm wasn't just for growing plants. he also had a few hundred pigs and a few thousand hens. he picked my father up in the field and drove to the manure at the back of the farm. i'm not sure how many of you are familiar with a liquid manure spreader but they have the ability to coat anything and everything within a 40' radius behind the unit with a very thick and very smelly coating of shit. well my grandfather loaded the spreader 3/4 full then just to make sure it stuck in place, broke a few bales of hay into the spreader. he proceeded to back the tractor and spreader up to the property line at jim's back yard and let loose. by the time he was done, he had done this on all three sides of jim's property and left a four inch thick coating of shit cemented in place with the hay around the entire property. it was that bad that jim had to pack up and lived at a campground for the entire summer. eventually he moved and had to sell the land back to my grandfather at a fraction of what he bought it for. tl;dr was a duck blind worth four inches of cemented shit?i used to live in a tiny studio apartment in a really shitty neighborhood with very thin walls and stupid neighbors. one of them had a girl over every now and then, and he made her presence known to all. he had his bed against the wall my bed was against. every time she was there, his headboard would repeatedly smack against my wall. worse, this dude had some serious stamina, so my boyfriend and i had to listen to this for hours. when i approached my neighbor about this, he said there were pillows behind the headboard, so that couldn't be him. he offered to show me and sure enough, he did have pillows stuffed behind the headboard. they were on the floor. the top of the headboard was hitting our shared wall, not the part bolted to his bed frame. he insisted this was enough and that would be the end of it. now i'm not going to pester my property manager over my horny neighbor, but i'm not going to start a band and use his headboard for tempo either. this had to stop, but how.... a while later, i was watching a video on youtube where someone had dubbed yakety sax over horrible things to make them funny. the boyfriend saw this and asked "why don't we use this on the neighbor?" that man was a genius. so we cued up the stereo with a copy of the benny hill theme, set the volume as high as it would go, and turned it off. armed and ready. sure enough, as we start falling asleep, he starts up. fire the first round! we blast the music. he stops. we turn it off and enjoy the silence. he didn't get the hint. he started up again, louder and more aggressive, enthusiastic than before. fire the cannons! this time around, we were laughing hysterically. the boyfriend called it "the soundtrack of their love." that musical cold shower ended all our problems. the nearby apartments were really pissed until they heard the story. it propagated though the entire building. that neighbor never brought another woman home.so this happened sometime ago when i was riding shotgun driving with my dad down a throughway. it was a 2 lane throughway that has a speed limit of 65 mph. my dad was going about 72 mph and would go into the left lane to pass slower cars, then he would get back into the right lane. we come up to this truck that is either doing the speed limit, or going slightly over, so my dad pulls into the left lane again to pass and then right when we are about neck and neck with this truck, this woman in a big ol' suv comes like a bat out of hell and is behind my dad. she starts honking the horn and you can tell she is losing her shit being behind my dad. i think what made my father mad was how all of a sudden this woman was going off the deep end, tailgating flashing her brights, honking the horn. what i found weird was my dad decided to just match the speed of the truck next to him. the revenge he stayed at the same speed as this truck for about a mile or two, this lady going bat shit the entire time. i asked my dad why he was doing this and why he didn't just pass the truck and let this woman be on her way and out of her life. he looked at me and said "son, it is not ok for people to act like that". now at this point there is a long line of cars in the left lane behind my dad, he slows down a little as if to have the truck on the right pass him. as soon as this crazy lady see this she switches lanes my dad speeds up and takes a whole train full of cars with him as everyone passes this lady who is now stuck in the right lane. not the best revenge story, but it was just cool how calm my dad was and made that lady learn a little patience.firstly, i have no idea if this story is true or not. it was told to me by a girlfriend i had years ago. either way it makes for a good story. she used to live in a town where in the fall, people would rake their leaves into a big pile on tuesdays, and then on wednesday morning a big truck would come around and suck the leaves up and take them away. some dumbass local teens had taken to driving around town on tuesday nights and driving through the leaf piles, spreading them everywhere and making a big mess. after having it happen to her a few times, she apparently took matters into her own hands. she raked up all the leaves one tuesday, and then placed a few cinder blocks into the pile so they could not be seen. sure enough, at some point later that night she could hear their car and hooting/hollering driving up the street into the leaf piles and when they got to her pile, she heard a loud bang and someone yell "what the fuck??". she peeked out her window to see one of the teens getting out and inspecting the damage before screaming to his buddies about the fact that his dad would kill him for the damage to the car, which apparently belonged to his dad...after which he got in the car and drove off slowly. she found bits of fender in the leaves the next day. oh, and apparently it never happened again.if this is better for petty revenge, just let me know and i will move it, but i thought it was better here. this was years ago when i was a supervisor at a grocery store and as you know people love to park in the fire lane for who knows what reason (i am guess entitlement or lazy). for our store this posed a few problems. one it was getting in the way of us bringing in carts from outside and two is that we had a drive thru for our pharmacy and people where getting in the way of that too (i even had a car park in the drive thru, but that is a different, less satisfying story). there are signs saying this is a fire lane and don't park there. ok time for the story. one day i was checking our cart situation, when a car pulls into our fire lane and gets very close to our doors. this is bad because i don't want our cart guys accidentally hitting his car when they bring carts in... and you know the whole illegal part. i see him get out and come in through the door i am standing by. i ask him, "please don't park your car there, it is in the fire lane." his response was to stare at me and just continue walking. ok fine, i gave you a chance. i inform my coworker working the service counter to call the police and inform them someone has parked in a fire lane. i inform the manager as well and i have told him the authorities have already been called. it takes 10 min. for the police to show up. the officer pulls up behind the car and my cart person comes and grabs me to tell me the police have shown up. as i am walking out the door, guess who shows up? that's right, the driver and he sees the police car right behind his and the officer less than 10 ft away that i was walking out to talk to. so what is his response now that this is happening? his response and i am directly quoting, "faggoty ass bitch". i am not happy about, but i say nothing. believe me i wanted to say something. i head back in and inform the manager what just transpired, when in comes the officer. he would like to speak to me alone. i really had no idea what was wrong or if i was in trouble. did i do something wrong by wasting his time or some other thing? well it turns out that the officer heard his comment and was planning on giving him a disorderly conduct ticket for his language. i want to say also for him parking in the fire lane, but i fail to see how that relates to traffic. he asks me if this is ok, i ponder this for a moment because i don't want to head to court if i have to testify or some such thing, but then the words he said pop back into my head and i agree to give him the ticket. here is the kicker, the officer continues to inform me that he can't do anything about the kid in the car, but he said he will inform the driver that he will mention this in his log and it will be seen by social services. i was not expecting that. i look over at the window to see the car and sure enough there is a kid about 6 or 7 in the back seat now jumping up and down. my only guess is that the kid was asleep when i first saw the car. holy crap, that far out weighs the parking in a fire lane or the car getting hit by carts. one of the customers later came up to me to thank me for calling the police because she saw that kid was left alone in the car (i told her i didn't know, but i would have called if i had seen that as well, pets too). the officer leaves and i go back to work and relieve my service counter worker to go on break. less than 5 minutes later the driver walks in and walks by the service counter and gives me the death stare. all i could think was, "i just wanted you to park your car in a normal spot." crap and now thinking back on that, he still didn't have his kid, i should have call the police again *smacks head*.i got some pa loudspeaker horns to battle my neighbors dog, after being rudely awoken way too early for a few weeks in a row. well, i decided to record my neighbors dog during one of these sessions. i then went ahead and got four speaker horns from craigslist and set them up pointed towards my neighbors house. i then played the recording of my neighbors dog barking for them one early morning for about an hour. have not heard the dog since. he is still there, but somehow the neighbors magically seems to have a better handle on the barking. not sure if this belongs here but i'll try :) wanted to post this early but had a crazy end of the month. so i run a fairly large dealer network (as many of you know) and because of this i have quite a bit of capital at my disposal. well i've been in this business since i was 18 i've been around the block more than a couple of times. i’ve also been ripped off before, and know how to protect my business. i’m no slouch, so don’t try and pull a fast one on me. i also believe that a man word is as solid and binding as a written contract...at least it was when i started. well one day i get a phone call, its henry. henry is a smart, bright, intelligent, young man from a fairly successful family. heck henry used to work for me! before his family decided to invest in him and buy his own dealership, that's all well and good...good for your henry. well henry calls me up and after a bit of small chit chat henry says that he has an excellent deal for me and would like for me to purchase a large quantity of his stock. i however am a bit overstocked on used vehicles (at that moment) and politely said "i'm not all that interested in buying any more stock " henry then confided into me he got himself in some sort of legal/tax problem and needed an influx of cash to pay out a settlement or his dealership would get foreclosed on. now i felt bad for henry, he explained more in detail on how he got in trouble and now had to pay the price. well he had about a 70 vehicles in stock and wanted to make about $200k in cash and was willing to part when some pretty good vehicles at very solid wholesale pricing. well fine, let’s see what he has. finding reconditioned vehicles, at a good price is always hard and helping out a fellow dealership is always a good thing. i told henry i'd stop on by and check out what he has on the lot so i did, i found in total about 20 vehicles in which i wanted to purchase for my used car inventory and i advised henry of this. we came to an agreement, those 20 specific vehicles for $220,000 giving henry more than enough capital to take care of his problem plus some extra cash on top. honestly the deal wasn't that great of a bargain for me but hey i wasn't going lose on this one. i also felt really good about giving henry a helping hand. we agreed, he said he needed to prep them and i'd pay for the transport back to my dealership. i however insisted on i would pay once the vehicles were delivered and not before. he was actually a bit peeved at this stipulation i then reminded him that the cash was not a problem and he knew this so he relented. all is well and done and a few days later we start the transfer and when everything is said and done my used car mgr calls me up and tells me henry only sent 17 over. when the truck driver (who knew) i had purchased 20 vehicles had brought this to henry attention he said "i knew what was going on and everything was ok" well everything was not ok, and a $220,000 car deal is not a small deal and i am most certainly going be checking in on this...now i figured henry sold 3 of the 20 vehicles to customers...that's ok we will just lower our agreed upon purchase price i take his 17 and we are done. so i called up henry. i expected the phone call to be pretty simple "hey henry, i got 17 vehicles we need to agree to a new price let me just deduct what those 3 vehicles where worth and i'll wire that over" keep in mind we didn't have a contract saying "i'll pay x for y" but i did have a list of vin numbers. henry bulked at this, said we had agreed on those 17 vehicles for $220k i balked right back and said he's being unreasonable...i was very upset at this point cause this man was honestly trying to pull such a stupid fast one on me? i then told henry "deal is off, you can come and pick up your vehicles" well of course he was having cash problems and it costs money to transport 17 vehicles so those 17 vehicles sat in my back lot for awhile. when eventually his dealership went bankrupt and everything went up for auction. i hoped on over and bought out his entire stock for a fraction of what it was worth! it was quite a significant windfall for us and our sales people where more than happy to sell them. now the story isn't over just yet...there is one more nail to be hammered in this coffin. my owner bought a dealership several months after this fiasco. i of course was in charge of this dealer as i was all the dealers in this owner’s network. so here i am inside the dealership getting a feel for this place when henry walks in (i was in a back office) henry approached a sales person, asked for a manager and told the manager he was an experienced sales person looking for a sales persons job. of course henry did very well in the interview with the sales manager and the manager called me up advised he had a great hire and wanted me to give a quick once over. i said to bring him on in, there i am sitting in my office when their is a knock on my door i say come in manager walks in first and starts to introduce henry when henry walks in right behind him and we lock eyes...you all of a sudden see this poor man soul get crushed, henry excuses himself and runs off to go to the "bathroom" the manager is quite confused and i simply say "nice find, but i bet you he ain't coming back" i've not seen henry since. o and henry made my sales staff very happy, not sure if you guys know how the business works however my sales staff is paid 25% on the profit of a vehicle. they get a 5% bump at 12 and another 5% bump at 15. well we got his entire stock of 70~ vehicles for a rock bottom price so lets say normally we pay say $15,000 for this truck and sell it for $18,500 with a $750 pack sales person makes $690~ however if we got that truck for $12,000 sales person now makes $1,440 or as much as $2,000+ so those 70 vehicles went through our dealer network very fast. we had quite a few sales person have zip code pay days because of henry. i posted this over on a darkest secret thread and someone thought you guys would like it here. not all that dark, but i've never told anyone my revenge story. when i was 10 years old, my mom sent me to a summer camp in another county. i knew 2 other people there and we were placed in the same cabin. the other cabin was full of the locals who had been there previous years. i was a fat awkward kid, and i got picked on all the time. this camp was no exception, but there was this one kid who was relentless. we'll call him sam. sam was always pushing me around, calling me names constantly. i wouldn't even eat if he was still in the lunch area. one day we were in our cabin talking about how mean the other guys were and i decided to seek revenge. i had to take a massive shit, so i grabbed this plastic grocery bag and filled it up. i took the bag to the other cabin while the other kids were out being cool. i found sams bunk, grabbed a pair of his underwear and shoved them down in the bag. after squishing it up again, i put it under sams mattress with a little bit of it hanging out. by the way, the stench was horrendous! relieved i hadn't been caught i ran out of there and back to our cabin. when the bullies came back in from playing, we could hear their disgust. it didn't take long for sam to be the new target of endless bullying. nobody wanted anything to do with the kid that shit himself. guess who didn't get picked on for the rest of camp?so, due to a comment i made in a /r/relationships post- i'm here to elaborate. background: i [28f] was 25 at the time, i moved from the east coast to the middle of nowhere. i had made what i thought was a great friend in a younger girl [21f] on campus. she reminded me of myself and on top of it she was incredibly intelligent and a joy to be around. she was unsure, had low self-esteem, was an introvert due to a really fucked up childhood. i really did everything i could to include her in everything, down to holidays with my family and worked on building trust. she deserved it. we got along so well and she started to come out of her shell and really blossomed. we moved in together. around this time i was admittedly dumb, young, naive, and got into a relationship with a 33m (twice divorced) because he seemed like the most interesting and tolerable human in the area other than my roomie. it should be noted that his first wife was a close friend of his hs girlfriend, his second wife was a close friend of his first wife. obvious pattern - not saying i was smart. the two of them over the course of a year hung out maybe 3 times at bars. they very rarely even talked to each other. in fact, he was an asshole and had little to no interest (or so id thought) in meeting any of my friends. she was gone for the summer for an academic pursuit, and when she came back i decided to cook a dinner for her and my so, as i wanted them to be friends, i wanted to be able to hang out with the both of them. we picked his place because it had the bigger kitchen. [side note: roomie had her first kiss as a drunken dare on her academic trip. she had never been hit on, let alone anything else.] in the midst of cooking, i realized i needed a couple things to finish dinner, put them in charge of keeping stuff from burning while i darted out for 30-45 minutes. came back... found so and roomie banging. needless to say i was devastated and maybe went a little nuts. and vodka became my bff, i lost a lot of weight. i kicked roomie out of the apartment, and threw all her shit on the lawn that night. she moved in with him. my friends back home tried to make me feel better by checking out the "hysterical" personal ads and casual encounters on craigslist. bad idea. i found several ads he had posted (he had a very unique and pretentious writing style.) and they stretched back at least 3 months. rather than wallowing further in despair, my friends back home drew up the game plan using pics provided by a friend of mine; we created a google number and all had access to text from. so i took the chance and replied to one of the postings. he was obviously oblivious. he also hated talking on the phone. so, i guess that's called catfishing. and we "talked" for three weeks (he travels for work) and set up a date. for the date, i picked a local bar in town with a front and back patio, told all my friends to tell their friends and packed nearly the entire place with team tananaramarex. the folks who we didn't know were soon in on the act. the friends he would recognize were on the back porch with me. i had a friend of mine serve (under a cover story) as bouncer/body guard/first contact. when we got the text he was there, i walked out with the friends that were hanging out back with me. and i confronted him, told him he was a piece of shit he was and how he should never do what he did to me and his ex-wives ever again, and took a bow to a standing ovation. i texted my former roomie as he left, told her what i did, and apologized for the condition he would be coming home in. i felt as if she was manipulated and told her i never had any hard feelings against her, really, and that i understood if she was going to hate me after that. i never spoke to either of them again. and despite the small size of the town, i never saw him again after that. i moved away back to civilization a year and a half ago. i dont regret what i did. i still feel bad about my former roomie. that piece of shit though... i hope he never dates another woman. **tl;dr: my so banged my virgin roomie, i kicked her out, catfished him from a craigslist casual encounter ad, and humiliated him in a packed bar. not sorry.** **[evidence literally pried out of my old ass external hdd]( other edit **i am more ashamed of dating this verbose cock-muncher now than i was then. what an awful piece of shit.**just replied in a petty revenge thread about cheating &amp; thought my cheating story belonged here. my mom's first year teaching included this class of seniors. they were a bunch punks who made her cry with some not so nice pranks like putting deer urine in her air conditioner and crazy gluing the lock in her classroom door. *these are two of the big things i remember that really upset her. my revenge consisted of selling them a fake answer key, which made them fail their test. they of course were upset, so they started blocking their cell phone numbers before calling me during lunch &amp; leaving death threat voicemails. unfortunately for them, my dad is an agent with the fbi in our small home town. after letting him know what was happening with the voicemails, he got pretty concerned. he doesn't play around with that kind of stuff, so he immediately got a ~~warrant~~ court order that day from a judge issued to the cell phone carriers involved to obtain the account information. after contacting the account holders (parents) and figuring out what was going on, he had them meet him at the school while the officer assigned to our campus pulled those seniors out of class in cuffs. he was initially pretty concerned which is what prompted him to get the ~~warrant~~ court order issued, but he didn't want to screw over these kids by pressing charges. instead he just put the fear of god into them &amp; explained how serious the situation could have been. nobody messed with my mom or i after that. ~~my mom's teaching

terrorism"i used to work for a company that was terrible about promising the moon and then dropping the responsibility for delivering it squarely on me. they promised customers hardware features that nobody in the industry offered. then they'd dump it in my lap and say, "make it happen". then the salesman who sold it would scream bloody murder, over things taking twice as long to install than they budgeted for. when you sell people things that don't exist yet, don't be surprised when it takes a tad longer than the handy spreadsheet corporate sent you says it will take. it really ate into their commission, so some of them wised up and would consult me before bidding a job with anything weird. one guy just never got the message. he did it over and over again, without so much as a "thank you", for bailing him out. i did my job, and i took pride in it, but one day he had the temerity to complain to our parent company about my open disdain for their lack of quality. it was no surprise to them as i was always ranting to their quality control people over stupid crap that they shipped out. i'm talking about receiving stuff with half the components falling off the board, because that half of the board hadn't been soldered properly. other things would come in, with parts missing, or the motor running backward, etc. of course all of them had quality control stickers on them claiming that they had passed some inspection or other. so far as i could tell the only way some of them would have passed even a visual inspection would have been if they were using satellite imagery. on most jobs, 4 out of 10 devices failed on initial power up. of the remaining 6 more than half would fail in the first year of operation. i'm a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to my work and this always upset, and embarrassed me. the conversation started over him trying to blame me for the number of warranty claims. he insisted that i must not be grounding things properly. nevermind every branch of the company was having the same trouble. i do admit to going on a bit of a tirade, but i was beyond fed up at this point and didn't really care whether i got fired or not. i take pride in my work. turd polishing is not something i signed up for, nor do i tolerate it quietly. especially when the company hasn’t given anyone a decent raise in almost five years. mr. letsblametheguy whosavesmybacon had just sold another real science project that involved field modifying our equipment to add a feature that it was never intended to have. meanwhile 6 different companies had equipment that had to be cajoled into playing nice with our stuff, and each other. of course on jobs like that, the final connections and making everything work together always gets overlooked when contracts are drawn up. you always end up with everyone arguing that they aren't responsible, and trying to push it off onto everyone else. it quickly escalates up the chain of command. well this time was no different. when i called to get him involved, he texted me back saying he "didn't have time to deal with it". he was heading out for a 3 week vacation starting that friday and had more important things to do. in the end, all i could get out of him, was "i don't care how, you do it, just make it happen!". normally i'd have pushed the issue, but for once i didn't. i meekly did what i was told and, "made it happen." i never once slacked off, but let me tell you, after a month of 70 hour work weeks, those jobs had some of the best documentation and the prettiest wiring harnesses i've ever made. nobody had to argue about a thing. every time another company pawned their scope of work off on me, i "made it happen", and documented my time meticulously. i even took the progress photo's he was supposed to submit, and submitted them. he never saw a dime of that commission. 120 hours of overtime that you failed to budget for, will kinda do that. edit: forgot to include the tl;dr tl;dr salesman drops a huge,job for equipment that doesn't exist in my lap right before going on a 3 week vacation. his only instructions were "make it happen". well... i made it happen by working so much overtime that my labor ate up his entire months commission. so i got to claim 120 hours of overtime and he didn't get paid that month. i used to keep a bottle or sriracha in the fridge at my last job. i even went as far as to write on the bottle that anyone could use it, just please return it. about a week in my bottle of sriracha goes missing. the next bottle i put in the fridge i wrote "do not touch" on as someone had already abused the privilege of having public domain hot sauce. a week or two later this bottle, too, goes missing. at this point i'm heated from my lack of delicious sriracha, so i go out and buy two bottles instead of one. the first i put in my cubby so only i could use it. the second i dumped the top inch of sriracha out of and replaced it with 4 million scoville hot sauce. i don't know who stole the third bottle, but i know that they were probably shitting blood as just the residue left on my hands after washing them 3-4 times was enough to make me gasp for air when i accidentally touched my finger to my mouth. poor bastard. a couple years ago i was in graduate school living with my gf and our 1yr old. we lived in a "cheaper" area of town due to my fantastic grad student salary...it was not a dangerous area....just kinda cramped. we lived in a townhouse apartment complex and had 3 other neighbors with a shared walkway/entrance area. for the first few weeks everything was great, relatively quiet and had lots of room for low rent ($650/month for a 2/2). until one of our neighbors started seeing a douchebag. we noticed that someone would regularly show up at about 2am with their bass cranked way up and would just chill in the parking lot while his bae got ready. normally it doesn't bother me if it was for a short period but he would sit for like 30 mins and sometimes he wouldn't even be in the car but leave his music blaring with his windows down. so i decided to ask him to turn it down while in the parking lot as he has been waking our daughter, and a cranky child is not fun to deal with all day long. he usually did but only for that visit, the next night it would be right back to the same volume like he had the memory of a goldfish. fast forward a couple weeks of this and than i notice he starts parking right in front of the walkway during the day. now to the average person it is clear this is not really a spot but rather a gap in the parking spaces with no parking block and with orange lines on either side to allow residents to go to and from the building without having to squeeze between cars. it is also smaller than the other spots but can still barely fit a vehicle. now keep in mind, this is a pretty small parking lot with many extra spaces....so its not like you save that much time or effort parking there compared to even the furthest spot. anyway, he starts parking there 100% of the time and just starts irritating my wife and i due to the fact that it can be a tight squeeze with a car seat or with our dogs. not to mention that this is not an spot to begin with. my solution is to park in the adjacent spot over the line so there is not enough room for his fatassed monte carlo to fit. his response? he parks behind my car in the middle of the parking lot thinking he can block me in. well he does and the next morning i have an important 7 am meeting and lo and behold i am blocked. thankfully i own a really cheap saturn to get me to and from class, i got it for about $700 so its also mostly plastic. in my early morning rage i decide to just nudge/scrape/hit his car with my car because i know he really cares about his vehicle as he is constantly cleaning and waxing it (yet he parks in the middle of the parking lot). a fantastic crunching sound ensues as i slowly push into his bumper than i readjust and pull out beside his vehicle, while scraping all. the. way. down. the side of it than i leave to work. when i get to work i notice a dent on my bumper that i smack to pop out and cleaned up some paint transfer. my plastic panels did not sustain enough damage to actually break as they just bent during contact and popped out. when i get back home the guy is in fury and is threatening to stab me and such but i claim it wasn't me and i was able to squeeze out of the spot...so the police were called and they look at the cars and see no fresh damage on my car and say it wasn't me . the officer also tells the guy "well what the hell did you expect when you parked in the middle of the parking lot". i also discover i was not the only one to hit his vehicle as there was another mark down the side, which to my delight, ended up being due to one of his girl's friends since she admitted to maybe bumping his car while backing out. after this incident i demanded to be let out of our lease with no penalty &amp; with our security deposit. thankfully the office obliged and we moved to another part of town. added bonus: after said douche fixed his bumper and door panel someone spray painted his white car with black spray paint (not me i swear!). edit: decided to add a picture i had. this was taken the weekend before the "incident" the parking lines on the left are all empty spots. you can kinda see my saturn in front of his vehicle. *(i had originally posted this in petty revenge but /u/brilliantlyinsane suggested i should post it here. enjoy.)* when i was a little girl, we didn't live on an actual street; we lived on a cul-de-sac. my neighbors had put up a basketball hoop at the end and it was the coolest thing because kids from all over would come and we'd play together. i could get along with every one of them except for these two boys. from day one, they called me every name in the book, made fun of me, called me fat, threw rocks at me -- you name it. i remember coming home to my parents and just crying because i didn't know how to handle it. they explained that they couldn't go out there every time i had a disagreement with someone so i should just say something back. next day, there they come. there's actually a lot of kids outside and i'm playing with my friends and they decide to come up and start name-calling but i turned around and called them the mf word right there in front of god and everybody. you know what they did? they told my parents. i was grounded for the longest time. so apparently they can't handle me talking back but i knew that i got on their nerves easily. once i was allowed to go back outside, that's all i did was bother them. i refused to play with my friends because i needed to annoy them. i was *that* kid. i would just say stuff like "you're stupid," "i hate you," "your mom hates you," "you suck," etc. on this particular day i was riding my bike. they decide to leave for some reason i can't remember and i call out to them "yeah, you better leave or i'll run you over with my bike." "you can't run me over with your bike!" ... excuse me? are you, are you... trying me? do you have any idea how long i've waited for something like this to happen? seriously? "yeah i can run you over with my bike!" "okay i'll just stand right here!" ... well if you're just going to stand there, i am not going to pass up this opportunity -- are you kidding me? so there i go. i turn my bike around the end of the court and pedal as fast as i can towards him and boom run him over. i was so proud of myself and kind of shocked that i did it. i hear from under me "get off me *cough cough* i can't breathe!" so i backpedal over him instead of getting off the bike and he is dry heaving so hard, i almost felt bad. he manages to spit out a few words in between his coughs. "why would you do that?" "get off my street, motherfucker." from that day on, i was never bullied again. edit: fixed minor grammar mistakes/rewrote sentences to make more sense. edit 2: whenever i'm having a conversation with someone about being bullied, i'll listen to whatever they have to say no matter how long-winded they are. it's a hard subject to talk about and if you're willing to share with me your experiences, i will hear you out. a lot of people don't realize this, but it's actually healthy to get upset or angry sometimes (however what you do with that anger is a different story). and to deny yourself those feelings and to hold onto them will only turn into hatred. and whether you like it or not, hatred is passion. instead of being passionate about things you love and people you care about, your passion is wasted towards brewing hatred. i realize that not all problems can be solved by fighting back but i am an incredibly stubborn and severely blunt person and i will not sit there idly and let someone aggravate me until all of my thoughts are polluted by whatever things they have done to me. i say all that to say this -- i admit that this story is greatly exaggerated, but i don't tell this story because i want bragging rights or because violence is the answer. i tell this story to inspire others to do something about their issues instead of not doing anything at all and letting all that anger bottle up inside of you; the very reason this subreddit was created. however, there is some truth to this story: i did get bullied, i did get in trouble for cursing, i did have mal intent with my bike, and i did scare everyone on my block. so all of you motherfuckers in the comment section causing a huge commotion over something that never happened to them need to calm the fuck down *immediately* and should probably do something productive at work for once instead of waste our dwindling natural resources used to create the electricity you are carelessly exploiting on trivial internet bickering. ***drops mic***ex employer left me with 10k of shares that can never be redeemed, not within my power. so i reported them to the cra for sred fraud. fines are 50% on top of what they got. so $100k means $150k you need to pay the government back. i also reported them for running income out of the country and the operations they run out of a 3rd world nation. i told them also about possible tax evasion scheme they also seem to have been running. if found guilty the fine is likely to bankrupt the company. while the audit is going, i'm still continuing to pursue my money and building a case against them. then when i win a judgement and they don't have cash, i'm going to go in to their offices and take their laptops and servers. i'm going to copy and format them, and then sell them. the ceo somehow has been immune to this "shortage of funds" situation, and i'm sure that there is massive fraud on their end. when it get's exposed, i will do everything in my power so that fucker ends up in prison. the money doesn't even matter to me, i could spend another 20k, if it ensured the destruction of his company and personal life. for the record, this company that doesn't pay me, had me make their main platform which they brag about front and center on their home page. i was lead developer and brought it to market under insane timelines with a inexperienced team. instead of thanking me, they scammed me, dismissed me the day the project was done without cause, and didn't even give me a reference for my work, that they've significantly profited off over the last 2 years. i have 0 sympathy for them anymore, the fraud needs to be exposed and i don't care about my money, just their shame. ceo getting assraped in jail though would definitely be a bonus. it's not just me, his fucked a lot of people in the past a lot worse than me. they just don't like fighting.i have been working at ralphs grocery store for 8 months now, and this story starts 1 month into my employment. it was raining outside and i was braving the elements to bring in carts for customers, and a lady, i will call her "mrs. wonderful", decides it is my fault that none of the available carts are dry, directing her very loud and aggressive voice past the stand with paper towels to dry the carts, right at me. i begin fuming inside at this entitled bitch who is too good for the elements, but i smile and wipe down her cart for her. i tell her that if customers brought their carts up to the front after unloading their groceries, none of them would be wet, but she disregarded my statements, and later left her cart in the middle of one of the handicapped spots, for it to get rained on. the gears have begun to turn in my head. months go by, with her coming in about twice a week to buy $300.00 dollars worth of expensive wine and vegan groceries, for her very wealthy husband i assume, based on her massive ring and porsche carrera gt. and then i became a cashier, and i saw my opportunity. whenever i worked, i would watch for her, and when she got in line i would hop on a register and call her over to my line to checkout. everything was ready for my revenge. at our first encounter behind the register, i slipped her salt off the belt to the side, because the only reason people buy salt is because they are out, and basically everything needs salt. i don't ring it up, its not on the receipt, its not in her bags, and its not hers. perfect. she comes in the next day, only for salt, and with a very unhappy look on her face, i smirk. i do this a couple more times, not every time, because this is a long play, and i cannot get caught, but about every third time. but i think she is about to put 2 and 2 together, so i move to phase two of the plan. i start to take items off her belt at other cashiers register. she comes in screaming at my manager because her items keep going missing. on the day before, i had taken the cumin from her belt on another cashiers register. mrs. fantastic speed walks in, arms a-swinging, and walks up to the 58 year old gentlemen who had rung her up the day before, and yells "where is my fucking cumin", and he started laughing. made this all worth it, and made me want to continue this to the next level. mrs. compassionate then storms over to my manager, who says she will look into it but never does because she thinks mrs. forgiving is just looking for free groceries. then mrs. giving begins to stare intently at the belt when she is checking out. fuck, what am i going to do now. so whenever i am sweeping the floors and i see her. i steal an item from mrs. sharing's basket. even watching the belt she sees nothing happening, yet her butter, an egg (yes, only a single egg from the carton), some spices, the occasional meat, and when i'm feeling really ballsy, a bottle of wine, gets put swiftly back on the shelf. i can visibly see her breaking down week after week. looking in her cart to make sure everything is there every minute, watching the belt, being aggressive and hateful to the cashiers. i step it up another notch. i start to not steal her groceries, but swap them with the competitors brands. i have no idea if she notices, but it makes me feel good inside to think that she is confused when she gets home. one particular night i replaced her 50 dollar bottle of wine with a 3 dollar bottle which i had stored under the register, one that looks eerily similar to the one she bought, and i think i saw her start to tear up when i rang the correct one up for the next day. at least i hope that's what i saw. 1 month ago i decided to lay off this woman because i think i broke her enough to say i've gotten my revenge. that didn't stop her from still checking over her shoulder, watching the belt, staring at the screen that tallies up the order every time she is in the store. but, she still leaves her cart in the lot and doesn't put it away, so i am still taking items out of her cart every once in a while, just to keep her on edge, anxious, and fearful, and will continue to haunt her shopping experience, forever. so mrs. delightfull, thank you for shopping at ralph's, where you get real low prices, and a fast checkout. tl:dr - i ruined a bitchy womans life by messing with her at ralph'si was out on the town one night with a group of friends when we were approached by my ex-girlfriend and her new bogan boyfriend. long story short, my relationship with this nutcase of a woman didn't end well, so she tried to confront me. my best mate turned around, suggesting that they leave, only to receive a punch to the side of the head from the boyfriend. i called the police, reporting an assault and within minutes the offending boyfriend was arrested. in the following weeks, he was convicted and made to pay compensation to my best mate. we spent the money on a great night out, at this fool's expense and he lost his job when his employer found out about the conviction. so my buddy got this sweet ass bike as a gift from his parents when he started his doctorate at cal tech. he'd had it for like a week, when it was stolen while he was at school. my friend was very determined to get his bike back. so he checked craigslist, and pawn shops. most people do this for a little while before getting tired of it and giving up. not my friend. he did this for two years, and finally found his bike for sale on criag's list. he set up a buy with the guy, and informed the pasadena pd. they all met up, the serial numbers matched (keep your receipts kids), and the cops arrested the bad guy. my friend was feeling kind of bad for the guy (considering he might not have been the one who stole it), until he learned from the cop he had 90k in unpaid parking tickets!got some flac in /pettyrevenge over this so i moved it here. my wife's stepmom for about the last 3 years is a total bitch. my father in law takes everything lying down. so she started pushing him around and trying to change his whole life. she kicked his 19 year old son out and permanently banned him. (even called the cops for trespassing when he came back for his stuff) made him get a new job. she keeps making new "house rules" that everyone has to follow: no showing up unannounced. c'mon really? kids can't just drop by to say hi to their dad? wtf? (rule arose from my wife wanting to come in when droping off her brother and sister after picking them up from school.) no dogs in the house. dad has had this dog for 10+ years and now he has to kick it outside when it is old and sick. other peoples dogs are not allowed. she made this rule about 3 days before my wife and i left for vacation. dad had agreed to dog sit for us months before. now we have to find a new sitter at the last minute. the rule was made just to overthrow the pre agreement with dad. her side of the family brings dogs over all the time. gets us all to chip in $200 to buy my father in law a $2500 gun for christmas then "forgets" to mention it was from all of us. we got a homemade triangle cutting board from countertop material scrap that father in law found at his job site. (he is a carpenter) the told us "sorry but money is tight right now". i'm not greedy or anything, we could have done a $20 limit or something. it's fine if you are poor and can't buy people gifts, but then don't go and ask for crazy expensive gifts and then shaft your family. so the latest thing is my brother in laws birthday party 4 weeks ago. they planned a dinner at a restaurant and set the date. at the end of the meal they say they can only pay for themselves cause money is tight. both brother in laws are working part time minimum wage and sister in law is 16 and no job(still lives with dad btw, that's right, won't pay for kids still in their house or the birthday boy after they arranged the dinner.) so my wife and i pay for the 5 of us and we leave. last weekend we went over there and saw that they both had brand new cars!! they were kias but still!! so while we were all hanging out she grabbed my rum and coke thinking it was her coke. i just didn't say anything. she was 9 years sober in aa, now she has to admit she drank and start over. my way a haha *edit* clarifying details and grammerit all started earlier last week, i just went to bed at ~10:00, and i had fallen into a peaceful sleep, only to be awoken at about ~11:45 by the sound of a car with one of those loud fart-can mufflers, flooring it down my street. alright, okay, i can handle it on occasion, maybe it's just the kids a few streets over messing around with their tuners, or some moron on a crotch-rocket motorcycle. fast forward to the next night. i go to bed after studying my ass off for a chemistry test tomorrow. all of a sudden, bbbbbwwwwwoooaaaaaaaa, brwoooooaaaaa, bwoooooaaaaaaa. there goes the same car again, this time past midnight, at ~12:30ish. this time i was kinda irritated, because it startled me. the next morning, my dad asks me if i heard the car, to which i reply yes. he tells me that he was walking by the window when he heard the motor, so he peered outside and saw a car with squareish head and taillights floor it down our street. i ask several of my best friends in the neighborhood if they heard it, and sure enough they did, including my friend that lives two streets over. the next day, i'm playing with my cat in the living room after dinner, and i hear the same muffler, this time driving slowly down my street. i opened the blinds, and caught a glimpse of a black bmw m3, drive up a driveway of a house at the end of my street. this house in particular has a lot of college parties, because sometimes i can see drunk and high people stumbling around through the big glass windows, sometimes naked. suprise surprise. later that evening, before it got dark, i drove past the house, and wrote down the license plate number, make, and model of the car. sure enough, later that night, our good ol' friend speedy gonzales comes drag-racing down my street. this time, i parked my car down on the street, and filmed him flooring his bmw down my street. at this point i'm done. your three strikes are up buddy, this means war. one day passes without sight nor sound of the bmw. by this time it's friday, the day when that house commonly has parties. now, for the revenge part of the story. little does this guy know, my ex-girl friend's dad is a cop. since i dated his daughter, we got to know eachother fairly well. anyways, after dinner, sure enough, mr. speed demon comes rolling up to the house, followed by truckloads of other scummy looking college students. i text my ex, asking for her dad's number. i give him a call, and explain the siduation. he told me to send him a text with the video, plate number, make, model, and the address of the party house, along with the time range mr. 2fast2furious leaves, so he can email it directly to the dispatch officer. later that night he replies that a unit is set up at the end of my street, waiting for dr. leadfoot to come rocketing down my street, and sure enough, it happens, this time at about 1:00. i go back to sleep, hoping the cop caught him. in the morning, after sleeping in, i check my texts, and sure enough, my ex's dad pulls through. it ends up they caught him speeding, intoxicated, in possession of marijuana, disturbing the peace, and with illegal modifications on his car. (no muffler) lastly i heard, he is now paying some hefty tickets and fines, and spending a bit of time in jail, with his nice car impounded for a dui. tl;dr- never, ever, disturb my slumber repeatedly. it will not end well for you. ***preemptive edit: this was originally written by me under a different reddit account on /r/pettyrevenge. a poster there suggested i should post here, so i did, on my new account.*** i'm russian-american, and every summer i spend time in a summer camp over there. great place, lots of fun memories ([canus]( for one), thinking about working there next year. this story takes place several summers ago. the previous school year was hellish for me (had a few things gone differently i might not be here today), so i was happy i'd get two months in russia before switching high schools. the first of three sessions at camp went well, i got a leadership award, celebrated my birthday, watched russia choke in the euro. that session ended and within two days the next one started, with new kids. the leadership award i got on the previous session somewhat enticed me to be more active in the camp. so first day, in the afternoon, i'm walking around meeting new people. walk into a male room of the city younger than us, call them city#2. (we lived in a building of 72, with kids broken up into six "cities" of 12 each, led by a lord/lady, the equivalent of a counselor.) anyway, i walk into this room, say hi, start chatting. a couple of the kids are making small talk, a third is lying on his bed facing away from me, playing on his phone. i try to get something going with him, silence. another attempt, the guy flips me the bird and says "fuck off, will you?". his english nickname at the camp turned out to be "blaine". i tried to get along with him and the other boys in his city, and things got better. or maybe just less blatant. the boys in my city started flirting with the girls both in our city and in city#2 (blaine's city). the first few days were fine, but slowly blaine and his roommates starting acting annoyed that our city was encroaching on "their" females. it didn't matter that they sat on their asses all day playing on their phones, they wanted the girls from their city to be talking to them only. i tried to stay off to the side of this, mainly because i had shit-all luck flirting with people, and because i felt that this would only get worse. but i still, for some reason, decided to play wingman for the other kids in my room. this got to the point where i faked light-headedness at night so that the counselor watching our hallway would be distracted enough to let messer (my roommate) slip down the hall after-hours. after that particular episode messer decided i shouldn't keep playing wingman and decided that he'd help me find a girl. one week left? no fucking problem. messer went about trying to find me a second half, me tagging along for shits and giggles. he very quickly settled on esme, a relatively tall, blonde girl from city#2. i took it upon myself to get acquainted with her because, well, she was pretty attractive for a 14 year old. in most other situations this would wind up being a borderline /r/neckbeardstories submission, with enough of my cringe to go around. but that didn't happen here. the afternoon after "highly suggesting" who i should try and hook up with, our building went to the pool. i chatted a bit with esme and it went reasonably well by any standards. i thought something had started. all the while, the relationship between the two oldest cities was crumbling to dust. someone from city#2 tried to spook a girl of ours during an archery event by firing into her lane while she was picking arrows up (as multiple people nearby had fired simultaneously, no one knew who was guilty). purposefully too high to hit anything, but close enough to spook. tim, my roommate built like a lineman, retaliated by fucking with city#2's compot drinks, putting salt in some, pepper in others, olive oil in a third. things were getting relatively heated. anyway, before i had a chance to tank any gains i made the next day, blaine did that for me. you see, esme was *his* girl, and i'd be damned if i didn't know that. more so, i was from city#1, so now by flirting with his girl i had signed myself on to the conflict. blaine, or one of his cronies, started by writing a "gossip note" in our building's "gossip box", a place where one could drop anonymous notes that, if deemed appropriate were read at the daily announcements. the note put in there contained a whole lot of shit, calling various people sluts, telling our head lord he was a drunk idiot, and naming city#2's lady a "shiteating hippy fucktard". the note was signed "hunter15991". now, anyone with a brain, if they saw this note, would understand hunter15991 has enough sense not to write something like that and sign his name. as i'm sitting in my room, in walks the lady from city#2. i had actually known her from the previous year of camp and was on quite friendly terms with her. our lady follows. city #2's lady looks pissed, and she shows me the unfurled note and asks me why i thought this way, why the hell am i coming here if i'm so pessimistic, etc. etc. our lady followed up by saying this was good for two warnings, and a removal of the leadership award i got the previous session. i was stunned by all of this and told them that in no way i thought any of that, why the hell would i sign my name, that this was some horrible set-up. i managed to argue it down to one warning, but was shaken. blaine had immediately gone for the jugular. a few hours later we started our second thematic game of the day. at the camp each day had a "theme", like indians, police, business. this day was military, and the second game was one where two enemy armies (with different colored paper strips taped to their shoulder) fought each other around the territory of the camp, trying to tear off each other's "lives" (strips of paper taped to the shoulder). i was placed into one army, blaine and esme into another. the game started, and we were maneuvered around by the lord in charge. we encountered the enemy and engaged them, i was running with a couple of other older boys finding high value targets and eliminating them. one of my comrades was george, a guy from our city. the other was imber, a beatboxing douche who lived with blaine (wasn't there on the first day). imber peeled off to take care of some annoying city#6'ers, while george and i tried to run a pincer around messer. as i'm shuffling closer towards messer (who was busy shuffling away from george), i was keeping my eye out for anybody trying to snipe me from behind. even with george watching my other side as he closed in, this left a 45 degree blindspot in vision around my right shoulder. something charged into this blindspot at full fucking force, knocking me to the ground. i try to roll over to see if it was someone who sniped me from behind. nope, no one retreating into that direction, whoever hit me must have continued running. at that moment, messer (no longer cornered, but still pursued by george), ran up and quickly tore my strip off, and then ran off to shake off george. i started to push myself up to a sitting position but before i got anywhere someone stepped on me. or, more exactly ran onto, over, and through me. that stunned me for a second and i lay there trying to regain my breath. for some reason i rolled over and saw blaine running off about 10 feet from me. the direction he was going in, the lack of anyone else in that immediate area - that fucker had just purposefully run over me. finally our general ordered a retreat (i don't know why he did not pause the game when i was knocked down, like he was supposed to). i walked back to our group and george told me that imber - purportedly on our side, was the guy who knocked me down. i accosted him with this and he claimed that he had seen blaine and went off to kill him, "accidentally" bumping me. malicious intent obviously could not be proven. well, fuck that, i didn't need a goddamn jury, blaine was going to pay for what he and imber just did. i made him my only target for the remaining three battles. first battle - nothing. on the second one i came close to tearing it off but was ultimately killed myself by an unrelated player. third battle. last life. final opportunity to show this fucker that yes, you can push me down, but i will still find you and still kill you. i ran around that field chasing my only target. nothing could stand in my way, every city#5 or city#6 kid who charged up to me was killed. i finally ended up 15-20 feet behind blaine as he was knocking it out with someone else. i saw my opportunity and charged. blaine didn't turn around until the final two steps - which put his right shoulder directly in my path. i could have bodychecked him, ripping his strip off, and spiking it into the grass. but unlike blaine i didn't want to break any rules. so i shout my palm forward. ripped the strip off, and juked slightly to the left to avoid hitting him. i had killed him. blaine's puny in-game life was now sitting crumpled in my hands. i was now the jaime lannister of the battlefield, *blaineslayer*. i darted around looking for my next target and spotted n, one of our girls (both city and army) under attack. someone else was ripping at n (literally), practically scratching with finger nails and trying to slow down n by latching on to her ponytail. i recognized that blonde blur. esme. i didn't hold a grudge against her like i did against blaine, but that was brutal play right there and it'd be much less brutal if esme was dead as well. i closed in. 15...10... "stop! stop!". someone was blaring a whistle. i felt someone bear hug me as well, turning my charge into more of a standing crawl. and then suddenly i was losing ground, being pulled back. the game had stopped. even the n-esme catfight had died down. people were staring at....oh my, they were staring at me! staring at me getting dragged out of the game by a counselor yelling at me for brutal play. this counselor had spent two years out of high school in the russian paratroops, so i decided to shut up and not resist. i was dragged over to our cities' lady. "hunter15991, your play out there was very brutal and dangerous. because we had to drag you out of the game we're giving you a second warning. the only reason you're not losing your leader title is because you got these warnings separately." at first i honestly believed her - maybe in my wrath i did manage to knock a kid down. i played a lot fairer than other kids, but oh well, shit happens. who do i apolog...wait a fucking second off in the distance i saw blaine and imber leaning against the building. both were dead, not in the game, and thus had the freedom to talk. suddenly blaine tapped imber on the shoulder, pointed where i was sitting, and the two started laughing. those bastards. he had complained and gotten me pulled from the game, and a warning given to me on top of that. whatever doubt i had left evaporated when my lady said the other party in the situation "was fine". if i had knocked down a 12 year old, they most certainly wouldn't "be fine" - the medic would be looking them over and i'd be told to apologize. but there was no one to apologize to - because this was all a fucking setup. so there i sat, for the rest of the game, trying to think of what i'd do next. i had already tried to take revenge on blaine, but he had upped the ante. i had to do something total. something to which there could be no response. and then it hit me. blaine was watching the warnings rise on me, one more warning, and i'd be stripped of my award, sent home, and banned from the camp for a whole calendar year. given that i still had a session to go, that would mean $1000 or so flushed down the toilet. why not give blaine some warnings? but the score was too lopsided for minor retaliation. at 0-2, if i goaded blaine into his first warning, he'd respond with forcing my third and final warning, a situation impossible to recover from. of course i could isolate myself enough to lower the chances of those warnings, but that'd make these last five days not fun at all. i needed to get him 3 all at once. from experience rummaging around in his room the day before (trying to find proof of the notes he had wrote), i noticed blaine had brought an ecigarette with him to camp. i normally don't give a fuck, even if you're 14, whatever floats your boat. but this time, that was solid, solid evidence against him. it anything would get him out immediately, it was the cig. but i couldn't just bring it to the attention of the lords, that would be too easy, too identifiable, and for all i knew i'd get my third warning for snooping around people's rooms. i had to "accidentally" find it, in the presence of a lord/lady, and then draw their attention to it without simply saying "blaine, why do you have an ecig in your room?". i started to think about how to purposefully "discover" something in front of other people, and yet still look innocent. i woke up the next day and a plan immediately came into my mind. the schedule in the hallway, which i had read while brewing tea in the morning, told us today was supposed to be "adventures" day, whose main event was an in-building activity where two cities, under the direction of the older city's lord/lady (#5 led city #5 and city#6, etc.), moved around trying to solve puzzles in various rooms. that meant i'd be sitting in the same room as blaine several times today, under jurisdiction of our city's lady. after lunch i walked up to the head lord and asked him what rooms would be in use, and if i needed to clean my room. i was told no, the only rooms in use would be the following four. one of those rooms was blaine's. everything had fallen in place. during quiet hour, while the main hall was empty, i got into the possessions of our city's lady. inside was a bag of lindor truffles she obsessed over. i took those truffles and hid them under my bed until blaine's room left for english lessons. i bolted in there and placed the bag of truffles inside a more-or-less empty drawer that i knew contained a couple bottles of soda. i then rummaged around for the ecig and placed it in there as well. perfect. the day continued along, we went to have dinner after the first event, and then were split into our three groups of two cities for the second event. just like i had remembered from past sessions, we were paired with city#2. in we went finally into "the tomb" (our redecorated building), and we went from room to room solving mysteries. we approached blaine's room 3rd, went in, and sat down. our lady started her script about what we needed to do in the room (it was undoing a curse of some sorts by toggling various mundane objects in the correct order). at a stopping point i interrupted and asked blaine if i could have a drink, since i was sitting on his bed, next to his drawers with soda. "fine" he said. you can be total 14 year old asses to one another in russia, but you had a social obligation to share food. to his credit, all he expected to see was a couple of bottles of soda. i started to open the drawer, and before our lady could interrupt me about disturbing the game, i opened it and pulled out the lindor. "while i'm at it, could i have some?". i held the bag and asked blaine. he looked at it strangely. our lady looked at him strangely, cut off mid sentence by finding her bag - for she had noticed it missing right after dinner - right in blaine's drawers. "what is this?" she asked, point at the bag. blaine was stammering something out as our lady got up and walked towards the drawers. this is when the killer blow struck. she walked over to me and grabbed the bag, prepared to spout off a lecture about stealing items. then she noticed the ecig. that woman might have valued her lindor, but upon spotting the ecig the lindor fell to the floor. up went the cigarette. blaine was pale as a sheet as our lady turned around and stood there, blankfaced, with the cigarette. after 10 seconds she said "go downstairs, inform the head lord of this...*incident*,...and then pack your bags." blaine left the room and we continued playing the inter-city game. suddenly the hostility we had experienced in previous games had subsided. blaine spent his last hours at the camp standing at the security post, waiting for his mother's car to arrive from moscow, 30ish miles to the northeast. i had managed to make it 3-2. and god, did i revel in that golden goal. but there was still one last thing to do. if you remember, i never got around to killing esme in the military game. her catfight had gone unpunished. i let it slide until the final day. awards for the campers were being discussed between the lords and ladies. there were two tiers - permanent awards like the one i got the previous session that came with a title, discount, website mention, and single-session awards that did not role over from year to year. i was asked to check nickname spelling for each kid that won an award. esme somehow qualified for a single-session award, and i smiled as i saw her name. "no, no, this one's wrong, it should be spelled a-s-s-m-e. trust me on this one." sure enough, esme was called up to the stage and received her certificate declaring "assme": an example of being an active camper", and corresponding name badge. i chuckled as she looked at the name and slowly put it in her pocket. was that a bit too much? potentially. but two years later, when i ran into her again, she had gotten a higher title, with the correct spelling on it. no, for those of you asking, nothing ever happened between me and her. i was already thoroughly put off by the whole blaine experience, and by the time i added her on the russian equivalent of facebook and noticed her flurry of white supremacist posts, all drive was lost. **tl;dr: roommate at summer camp inadvertently drags me into conflict between two groups of males by introducing me to a blond acquaintance of the other group. i am targeted by that group for halfheartedly trying to flirt with her, because she is *theirs*, despite them not really going after her. am slandered, injured and come pretty close to being banned from summer camp i loved. instead i manage to get their leader kicked out by setting him up for theft and tobacco possession.** alright. this was told to me by a friend. he is the pilot of the story. this happened on a towboat. a towboat holds about 5-7 people. the captain is the highest and his word is pretty much law on a vessel, then the relief captain, then pilot, then engineer/tankerman, then deckhand. the captain who we will call cap was a colossal dick. he constantly tormented the deck crew. he lost over 50 deckhands in one year. deckhands would literally just leave the boat whenever the boat would dock for fuel or for barge transfers. the captain was giving a stern talking to but considering that captains are like gold, it would take an extreme amount to get them fired. enter riou. riou was an innocent faced, 18 year old kid. he was very eager to learn and tried to take the initiative to do as much as he could. he had a great attitude and my friend could easily seem him advancing soon. cap on the other hand had a permanent stick shoved up his ass and hated riou. he would constantly make homophobic slurs against riou. frequently implying that he wouldn't even let riou perform certain sexual favors no matter how much riou begged. riou at first, took it well. he just figured it was new guy hazing, but even the other more experienced deck hands thought this was extreme. not because of what was being said but because of the malice behind it. cap also gave riou extremely ridiculous jobs like telling him to go out with a toothbrush and scrub the barge. it's around a 110 degrees in august and he is having this kid on his hands and knees on a heater barge that has heaters that heat the sludge/oil so it doesn't solify inside the barge. so the barge is easily 300 degrees. my friend did what he could to help the guy because he didn't want him to quit. he was telling him that he only had to make it 3 more weeks then he could request a transfer to another boat and he would make sure he got it. riou had other plans. so to make sure you guys understand what happened. watches are 6 hours long. captain was on front watch, so he worked 6 to 12, both times. the pilot worked back watch which was 12 to 6. the wheelhouse is the usually the highest point of the boat. this boat had 4 decks. wheel house on the top, then the pilots rooms on the third deck, then the second deck which housed the crew, then the bottom deck which was the galley, engine room, generator room, and rudder room. stairs separate each of the decks. so, cap just relieved my pilot friend and he was heading downstairs to his room to get some stuff then go eat breakfast. riou was heading up to the wheelhouse, as the captain usually calls him up there first thing in the morning to give him his shit list. as my friend was coming out of his room he heard riou screaming along the lines of "no, get your hands off me, stop! oww. why are you doing this?" then the pilot hears a large thud. he ran to the stair case and saw riou laying at the bottom in a crumpled heap and cap up at the top screaming stuff at riou. my friend thought the captain finally snapped and tried to kill a deckhand, he did insinuate that he would do it often enough. so the office is contacted. they had to get riou off the boat and to the hospital. i believe he ended up having a couple broken ribs, a broken wrist, and i believe a concussion. the local authorities are called and cap is arrested after they took everyone's story. riou claimed that cap pushed him down the stairs. cap lost his job, his license, i think he was put on parole. my friend said he never talked to him again and only heard about what happened through other towboaters. riou on the other hand healed nicely and even continued towboating. fast forward 5-6 years and riou is now an experienced engineer when my friend is riding over to make some extra cash and is put on the same boat as riou. before my friend got off the boat, riou confessed to him that riou did it to himself because he couldn't take it anymore. my friend had a lot of self conflicting issues with this story as to whether or not to tell the office the truth, but so far, he still hasn't. it's been about 10 years since this has happened. tl:dr captain gets arrested for karma.**i had originally posted this in r/pettyrevenge but it was suggested that i cross post it here too** does it count as petty revenge if the target didn't specifically do anything to me, personally? a few years ago i went back to school to get another ba because the first time around my gpa could be charitably called "aggressively mediocre" and i really wanted to go to grad school. my wife had a full time job at the time so i didn't need to get a part time job or anything but i get bored easily. i applied for a campus security job because it fit my schedule and wasn't particularly demanding work. it was a pretty easy gig involving mostly sitting around in the lobbies of various dorms on weekends and checking ids of incoming individuals to make sure everyone coming into the dorms was a resident or guest. it was part of the campus safety initiative. most of the time i just sat there and studied since most of the excitement was just after last call—this is in canada so it's pretty normal for freshmen to be legal drinking age. occasionally, i was asked to patrol around campus and ticket cars that were improperly parked. i didn't mind the walking but ticketing students never sat well with me—who has money for that shit?—so this was not my favorite part of the job. as an aside, i tended to not give out tickets unless the person parking was actually blocking something important or their parking job caused a hazard. fuck the man. anyway, one day in the late fall—still above freezing but not by much—i was outside the engineering building and i saw a newish bmw 3-series—or maybe it was an m3, i don't recall so i'm just going to say it was an m3 for brevity—parked in the handicap spot and it did not have handicapped tags. as usual, i approach the car slowly, like i'm sneaking up on it. i discovered that people who are about to get a ticket tend towards the loud and aggressive. i've found that no one actually likes the meter nazi and a loud, blustery car owner tends to attract an unsympathetic crowd. it's better to sneak up on the car, confirm that it is, in fact, illegally parked (or has an expired pass), walk away, write the ticket, and then casually return and slip the ticket under the wiper. &gt;be me, meter nazi &gt;use stealthy ticket &gt;it is very effective i wrote out the ticket stuck it under the wiper and walked off. i did another walk around the rear parking lot and then, because it was near the end of my shift, i returned to that same building because there was a tim's inside and i wanted to grab lunch and a coffee. i go inside, get my coffee and sandwich then go back outside to have a smoke. i'm standing by the [smoking pawn]( don't actually know what these things are called—drink in one hand, sandwich tucked in my jacket pocket, smoke in the other hand, and just zone out. next thing i know there's some guy in my line of sight swearing loudly. i zone back in and realize it must be the owner of the m3. he's this skinny dude, wearing a [puffy vest]( and he's got fancy hair. i figure he's probably 18 or 19. 20 tops. he's got the yellow envelope in one hand and he's all, "fucking shit, fuck fuck, dick, cunt, shit, fuck, motherfucker, etc." while he's swearing and having a bit of a spaz, he's also looking around, presumably to see if the meter nazi is still around so he can give him a piece of his mind. oh wait, i'm the meter nazi! and i'm like 30 feet away! still smoking. sandwich in my pocket, coffee in the other hand, parking ticket printer slung across my chest. well shit. &gt;be me &gt;be at the end of your shift &gt;expect to be yelled at by puffy vest fancy hair i steel myself for the eventual tirade. policy is we have to be all beta about confrontations. our interactions should consist of "yes sir/ma'am", "no sir/ma'am", "i understand, sir/ma'am" but overall being firm about why they received a ticket. he swings his vision around several times but doesn't seem to spot me. i'm not wearing anything distinct other than the mandatory, blue, campus security jacket, and a *ticket printer*. he keeps looking around. left. right. left. right. i take another drag. for whatever reason, he doesn't see me. he angrily throws the ticket and yellow envelope into his car, bleeps the car with his remote, *and heads back into the building*. so, i'm still standing by the [smoking pawn]( sandwich in my pocket, half-full medium double-double—the old medium, not the new upsized medium—with one drag left on my smoke. so i finish my smoke, feed the pawn, and sit down at the nearby bench to have my sandwich. i'm sitting on the bench, eating my sandwich, drinking my coffee, and staring at this m3 that is still parked in the handicap space. "i'm gonna finish my sandwich, drink my double-double, *have another smoke*, and then i'm going to give him another ticket", says i to myself. "it's a trap", replies my brain, making a very good point. "i dunno man, this is too good of an opportunity to pass up." "i'm just saying" "how could it be a trap? what, he has a gang of puffy vested bros in there just waiting to challenge me to a [dance off]( "do whatever you want, just no concussions." my brain made a valid point. this would be an excellent trap. i pop the last of my sandwich into my mouth, wash it down with my now lukewarm double-double and light up another smoke—du maurier light kings with the droopy cigarette impotence warning, no doubt—and stare at the entrance to the engineering building. no sign of puffy vest fancy hair. with one hand i start typing out the ticket on the printer but don't press the "print" button yet—if i hit the button it saves the data and there's no way to undo it once that happens. i wasn't yet ready to commit to this course of action. i finish my second cigarette, pull out a yellow envelope, take a breath and hit "print" as i start walking toward the car. the thermal printer quickly spits out the ticket and i quickly insert the ticket into the envelope and sling it under the wiper. nothing happens. no ambush. no screaming. no puffy vest fancy hair. all that buildup for nothing. i check my phone—if i recall correctly, it was a motorola flip phone of some variety—and shift ended a few minutes ago. i'm not technically in any hurry to get back to the office, we have lots of ticket printers for the next shift so i'm not preventing anyone from starting their shift by dillydallying. i use the camera phone—with a whopping 640x480 resolution—to take a photo of the ticket sitting on his passenger seat and a photo of the ticket under his wiper. then i walk into the engineering building, get another coffee and plant myself back in the designated smoking area, and i hope that this kid isn't in a three hour class. i'm now here for a show. i'm going to get yelled at, it'll be a huge scene, i'll have to be all professional about it, but seeing puffy vest fancy hair have another spaz is totally worth it. "you're an idiot", says my brain. i let my coffee cool just for a bit before i take a swig. of course, i forgot to check where the paper cup seam was and dribbled coffee down my chin. son of a bitch. i put my coffee down and awkwardly wipe the coffee dribble from my chin just as i hear another stream of, "cunt fuck motherfucker what the fucking fuck" erupts from the vicinity of the m3. "who the fuck did this?!" "what the fuck?!!" there's puffy vest fancy hair: sack of fast food in one hand, jumbo fountain drink in the other—ah, to have the metabolism of a 19 year-old again—he's whirling around, trying to find the meter nazi again while swearing up a storm. he's now making enough of a scene that people are actually staring at him as they walk by. for some reason, he still hasn't spotted me. i'm standing a mere 30 feet from where he is spazzing. i am right beside the smoking pawn, wearing a blue jacket that says "campus security" on it. i have a printer slung over my shoulder and across my chest. for some reason, his gaze never lingers on me at all. after a few more seconds of spazzing, he gets in his car, throws the other ticket onto his seat and speeds away. why he didn't see me is inexplicable. the only hypothesis i have is that he was expecting the parking enforcement officer to be wearing something else. maybe a [high visibility vest]( or maybe something [like this]( i dunno. i don't recall how much those tickets run (a few hundred i think) but that kid had one expensive day. my boss did tell me that the kid's father called in pretty pissed about the tickets. i had emailed my boss the camera phone photos that afternoon because i figured he'd probably ask my why i wrote two tickets to the same guy on the same day. my boss explained to the kid's father that because campus security had witnessed the driver return to his vehicle, remove the ticket, and leave, it counted as a separate parking incident, thus, two tickets were warranted. **tl;dr guy in puffy vest gets a double shot of karma for parking in handicap zone.**lead up: my uncle enlisted at the beginning of world war 2 just like his 2 brothers and all his friends. he was sent to europe after training and saw a lot of action. as a private he had a very nasty sgt. that picked on him a lot, even though he was a year older than the sgt. it could've been because my uncle was a staunch, practicing mormon. he didn't smoke, drink or chase women. the sgt. gave him all of the crap details, dressed him down and held up promotions. in one combat action my uncle personally captured a german colonel and his entire headquarters staff (he brought home the colonel's full dress uniform, pistol, ceremonial dagger and even the boots!). because of this action, my uncle was sent back to the states to attend officer's candidate school. the sgt. tried to stop that, but couldn't. it was too big a deal. the revenge: uncle returns to europe and does well, rapidly advances from 2nd lt. to lt. to capt. and is given a new company. in the new company is the nasty ol' sgt., who is still a three-striper. when he found out who the new c.o. was he about shit a brick. uncle had him called to his hq and had him sit outside his office for 6 hours and then sent his aide out to give him his transfer papers. uncle walked out of his office, past the sgt. and doesn't say a word to him, doesn't look at him or even break his stride as he walked past. i asked my uncle why he never got back at the sgt. uncle said he did: he bacame an officer and went on to live a fantastic life full of adventure, love and excitement. the sgt. was always just a pos. hi everyone, would firstly like to say a big thanks to every who has subscribed and contributed to this sub, we now have over 12'000 subscribers! the mods have had a talk and we have decided it is time to implement a couple of rule changes to make /r/prorevenge a better place. effective immediately, posts asking for ideas or suggestions about how to get revenge will be removed. [example]( - posts like this will no longer be allowed. please submit full revenge stories only. also starting now, posts which seem very unbelievable may be removed by the mods, unless the op can provide proof (this may be messaged to the mods). edit: we will not require proof for every post, only posts that seem fake, asking for proof will definitely not be the norm! those are the only two new rules, we think these will better the sub and make it a better place. i would just like to make a reminder an existing rule: cross posting (x-posts) are allowed and encouraged, but we ask that you please copy the text into a new self-post on this subreddit, instead of providing just a link to the original post - a link to the original post may also be provided, just not by itself. please also remember to credit the op if the revenge story is not yours. [example]( - this post only provides a link. [example]( - this x-post has the text copied into a self-post on this sub. that's it, again thanks to everyone who has subscribed and contributed here, hopefully these changes will make /r/prorevenge a better place. please upvote this post for visibility, i gain no karma as it is a self-post. edit: this is important: please note that we would like to strongly emphasise that proof will only be asked for in exceptional circumstance ie. the story is very very unbelievable and we are 99% sure it never happened, but we would like to give you chance to prove us wrong.back in the 1990s i was enjoying college life, much the same as any kid. though i had a great many friends, i wasn't popular with the ladies at the time, due to my extreme shyness. even when girls would show interest, i either didn't pick up on it, or was way too shy to do anything about it. so the big man on campus (bmoc) lived next to me in our dorm. you know the type - good looking, rich family, born on third base and thinks he hit a triple. this is the kind of guy you saw with a different girl every week. he left of trail of broken hearts on his wake, but it takes two to tango, so whatever. now one day, bmoc decided he didn't like me. i'm guessing mostly because i wasn't successful with the ladies like himself. i was a quiet neighbor, studious, early to bed type who rarely said a word, so i cant imagine i did anything to gain his ire. nevertheless he decided to torment me every chance he got for a few weeks - physical aggression, verbal assaults about my lack of manliness, typical immature bullshit. anyways, i had enough and went to work with a little revenge scheme. i was visiting the er of the local hospital with flu symptoms, when a brilliant idea hit me. sitting in the patient room waiting for a nurse to see me, i noticed a stack of letterhead with the hospital's information on top. i popped a few of the papers it into my backpack, and after my visit returned to my dorm room. . . and pc/printer. i wrote a professional sounding, medical term laced letter to bmoc detailing the fact that a young girl had come into their free clinic who had been diagnosed with syphilis. she had given the name of several of her sexual partners, including bmoc, and they were requesting he come in to get checked out. i dropped the letter into campus mail on thursday, which means he would receive it in his box on friday. oh, did i mention the clinic he received the letter from was only open mon-thur? :) thus, he would have to wait a few days to contact them and get tested. bmoc received his letter on friday (confirmed by co-conspirator friend who worked in the campus post office). every time i saw him the next few days, he looked like he had seen a ghost. not really sure of the outcome at the hospital when he showed up with fake letter in hand, but i do know he chilled right the fuck out the rest of that semester. i imagine having the shit scared out of you will do that to a gigolo. **tl/dr:** sexually promiscuous asshole bully is tricked into thinking he might have gotten syphilismy(17f) half-sister, mary(19), and i are really close. she has this boyfriend, steve(21), that she's been with for about 4 years now. the boyfriend has an older sister who is a complete mess (doesn’t work, lives off gov't aide and her parents, does drugs, dates felons, in and out of jail, etc.). we'll call her jenny(25). j has a son, brandon, who is 7. this story happened almost 3 years ago. she still doesn't know it was me. since mary and i are so close i used to go over to her boyfriends with her often. jenny and steve lived with their parents at the time since jenny got evicted from her section 8 apartment for promoting violence. she was always around. she didn't have a job. she was super violent and aggressive towards everyone all the time. she used to threaten to fight her parents and brother all the time. the cops were always being called because she couldn't keep her hands off of people. she was also going through this really long dragged out court process with her sons father, tate. she was trying to keep tate from seeing brandon. she succeeded for 2 years but the guy wised up and took her ass to court. mary and i grew up without our fathers and the thought of brandon never knowing his dad and being raised by his psychopathic mother really tugged on my heart strings. one time jenny reached out to me on facebook saying she didn't want to be a mom and she was thinking about giving brandon up for adoption. i screen shot the messages and sent them to tate. i didn't hear another thing about it until months later. i'm not sure how she found out or why she blamed my sister, but jenny attacked mary while she was sleeping. she just started punching her in the face repeatedly and calling her a ni**er. (mary and i are black and white mixed, everyone else in this story are all white). steve called the police but jenny took off before they arrived. it wasn't until after the incident we found out it was because she thought mary was posing as me and sending the messages to tate. jenny was arrested a week or so later for assault and battery. mary filed charges and got a restraining order. jenny spent almost a month in jail waiting for her sentencing but just before thanksgiving, her mom bailed her out. her terms were that she could not contact mary in anyway or be within 100 yards of her. here's where the revenge comes in. i knew jenny's facebook password and i logged in using a vpn changer and sent my sister threatening messages. my sister screen shot them and sent them to her victim rights advocate. jenny was arrested again the next day for failure to comply with her bond agreement. jenny thinks it was tate's wife, even to this day, who sent those messages and "hacked" into her facebook. she thinks tate's wife is still hacking into her facebook. she's become so paranoid about it. it's hilarious to watch, really. unfortunately, jenny is still as violent and volatile as ever. edit for names. i was going to post this in petty revenge but my friend said it would do better here so here i go. now note, i did this because i read this somewhere else, and thought i would try it. &amp;nbsp; **backstory:** about three weeks ago, a kid that goes to my school and me got into a fight the night before playing hockey. so, he apparently hadn't vented all his anger towards me and popped the front and back tire of my bike, in two locations! he was actually very smart to do this, as i only have two patches in my patch kit. now, as i've said in other stories, my school is about 8k away from my house. my parents were out of town for a while, and my brother can't legally drive. so i was stuck with the option of ride my bike home and destroy my rims, or walk. so i walked. and walked. and walked. as soon as i got home i went on to reddit to try to find other peoples revenge in similar situations and found one that suited me perfectly..... &amp;nbsp; **revenge:** at my school, you can rent lockers by asking the secretary for a key to locker number xxx or something. you can have these lockers for two weeks for free, then you start to have to pay for them. (1$/month). my friends saw the fight happen and agreed to help me with revenge. two weeks before the end of the school year, we all (6 of us) started going in every two hours or so and checking out keys with a different secretary each time. (there were 3). then we'd wait three or so days and repeat. we got 28 keys in all, three days before the end of the year. on the final day, we all had to go to an end of the year assembly. however, me, and all my friends skipped, grabbed his phone out from his desk, and started our plan. we locked his phone in a locker, then the key to that locker in a locker, along with a complicated math equation to tell him what locker number the key he had went to. then locked **that** key in another locker! we repeated this with all the keys, until we had just the first key and a math equation. we set those in his desk, and wait. i will update to see how he reacts, hope you liked my revenge!!!! **tl;dr:** guy makes me walk 8k home, i make him do math. **edit:** he finally got his phone back, and my friend told a friend who told guy in story, who's now really mad at us. i also, as final revenge, locked his locker key in a locker when he was busy and took the idea of a commenter, thanks /u/mynames_dick and wrote an equation that said how many steps northeast or something he had to walk to get the key to get his key back:) **edit 2:** alot of people are asking this, i picked up all the keys he used when he was working on the next locker, and i gave them back to the office.when i was about 12 years old i lived at the end of a dead-end street. my friends and i all loved sports &amp; since my road had no traffic it was the perfect setting for all our football &amp; street hockey games. about 5 houses up from mine on the opposite side of the street there lived an old man who was a complete asshole. his favorite thing to do was to sit in his living room &amp; stare out his front window looking for shit to complain about. he would seriously bitch about the most trivial shit trying to get us in trouble. he would call my parents because we were going too fast on our bicycles, because we had hung on the rim of our own personal basketball goal...it was ridiculous. one day he took the shit too far though. for christmas i had gotten one of those neat nerf footballs with a tail that you could throw a mile. it was just a couple days after i got it &amp; we were playing football in the street when one of my friends missed a catch &amp; the ball took an odd bounce landing right in ol dickhead's front yard. like a geriatric flash his old ass was out the door, snatching the ball up &amp; carrying it back inside. i ran up and knocked on the door and asked for it back because it was my football &amp; he basically told me to go fuck myself, it was on his property &amp; it's his football now. little did this old man know that just recently my friends &amp; i had developed the technology to fill water balloons with any kind of liquid we wanted. this fancy piece of engineering was a simple 2 liter coke bottle. the trick is to fill the bottle with liquid, blow up the balloon with air, pinch it closed &amp; then put he balloon on the neck of the bottle. simply turn it upside down &amp; your balloon is now full of whatever. i rallied the troops and we went to work on building up our weapons cache. we all took turns pissing in the bottle until it was full, put on some kitchen gloves &amp; started filling balloons. in the end we had about 4 or 5 good ones. as soon as the balloons were full we sprang into action. we all unloaded our ordinance right on his front door, watching as the balloons unleashed their steaming payload all over the entry way. we all bolted for some nearby bushes to hide &amp; watch the show. hearing the impacts ol' dickhead comes flying out the door &amp; almost busts ass from slipping in the puddle of piss. he let loose with one of the best fits of rage i've had the pleasure of hearing to this day. never did get that football back but after hearing my side of the story my dad bought me a new one. original thread: [here]( so, i honestly had no idea it got big or that people cared so i am super sorry that i didn't update sooner! it didn't seem like anything happened right away so i was feeling a disappointing update would suck, but it all worked out really nicely. my manager updated me on the situation a bit. so, the day i came back it turned out they had taken her up to hr and told her they knew about the comments. she demanded to see the print outs but they said no. when she came back down she was pissed off (and was for days after that) whispering to people about how unfair it all was. a few coworkers actually deactivated their facebooks for a few weeks in paranoia that something similar would happen to them. then it really seemed like nothing happened and i was pretty bummed, but then my coworker who hates her way more than i do gleefully told me otherwise. so, right after the event she took a "vacation" to texas. this vacation was really sudden, considering we require three weeks notice for vacation. she's also talks constantly so we hear about all of her plans months ahead of time. this one she didn't talk about at all. i found out the reason for her sudden vacation was that she was suspended for a little over a week, but used the excuse of a "vacation" to cover it up and visited some friends of the family. she didn't tell a soul (i guess she was really embarrassed) but my coworker who hates her is very good friends with one of the higher up managers and found out. she doesn't suspect me at all because i'm such a sweet person outwardly, even to her. she's actually been even nicer to me lately than ever and even ran up and glomped the hell out of me at work the other day out of nowhere. so maybe she learned her lesson? not too sure, but it's a happy ending in my books. this is a two-fold revenge. part is revenge on my behalf by someone else. the other part is not mine, but it was perpetrated by one of my clients who told me what he'd done almost ten years later. i've been in real estate in chicago (actually southside and south-southwest suburbs) for nearly 20 years. so, i'm helping a guy sell his condo. the place was absolutely gorgeous. the guy was a general contractor, bought it as a dump, gutted it, and turned it into a palace. what makes this even more entertaining is that the guy was 84 years old. his wife died, he sold his house, bought the condo, and figured he'd die there. nope, he ended up meeting some spry little 77 year old hottie and they were going to get married and live at her house. let's call the seller mike. a guy, who we will call big f#%king a%?hole (bfa) comes to see the condo which is somewhat overpriced, but it was severely over improved and i thought we could get that price. i didn't notice bfa's appointment time when i went to visit mike for a signature on a price reduction. so, i just happened to be there when bfa shows up. bfa shows up and doesn't have an agent with him. this is a no-no, but since i'm there, i walk him through. he mentions that he called his realtor because he saw my sign. so, this wasn't a property that his agent actually found for him. oh well, whatever. he seems unimpressed and leaves. mike drops the price to $235,000 and wants $225,000 minimum because he doesn't want to owe anything after closing. bfa's agent calls me and says bfa wants to make an offer, but she's busy. she wants me to meet with her client to write up an offer. i point out the legal issues with this and she's like, "i won't say anything if you don't." i call my broker (not the same one in the previous story i wrote) and explain the situation. he asks his wife (also a realtor) to handle writing up the offer. illinois allows dual agency (where i can help a buyer and seller at the same time for the same property), but i can't do it for a realtor with another brokerage. after my broker's wife gets done, bfa tells her he's having second thoughts and to hold off. during the next two weeks, bfa shows up at mike's condo seven times unannounced, no appointment, and has no realtor with him. mike is a nice guy and thinks he's got a hot buyer, so he lets the guy in to look around, measure, write notes, take pictures, etc. i had no idea this was going on or i would have put a stop to it. anyway, bfa talks to mike who's ready to move. bfa says he knows mike only bought it for $100,000 three years earlier. mike tells the guy, that the lowest he's going is $225,000 because he took out a construction loan and put about $100,000 into the full-gut remodel with high end materials and appliances. i'm not kidding. the place was spectacular. 3 bedroom, 3 bath, living room, huge chef's kitchen, wet bar, jacuzzi tubs, formal dining room, vaulted ceilings, family room, loft, and every room was wired for phone, cable, surround sound, and internet (which was a relatively new thing at the time). mike also showed bfa the net sheet i gave him which showed that at $225,000, mike would walk away with $1,900. bfa calls his realtor who calls me to have me make the offer that my broker's wife wrote up. however, bfa calls my broker's wife and tells her to lower the offer from $230,000 to $223,000 because "that old man can afford to bring a hundred bucks to closing." (the way the numbers work based on the net sheet and market time, mike still would have walked away with a few bucks.) i get the offer from my broker's wife and she tells me to "enjoy the little gift and i'm not taking anything away" (i'll explain this later). i present the offer to mike and mike tells me to just hold onto it because he has another appointment scheduled and wants to see if they'll make an offer. they don't, but mike waits anyway. at this point, bfa has inconvenienced him multiple times and gave a low "i'm gonna screw this old man so he walks away with nothing" offer after having a very frank discussion. bfa is calling every day to ask about his offer. i can tell that he loves it. his agent? nowhere to be found. never got a call from her. finally, 3 weeks later, bfa's calls have gone from innocent inquiry to angry screaming. (no, there's no time limit on illinois real estate contracts unless you put one in and he didn't.) mike finally signs off because he feels bad for me. he would have left bfa hanging another 3 weeks if he didn't feel bad about me having to deal with the calls. bfa does his inspection and tries to renegotiate. mike tells him to drop dead since mike is a general contractor and knows the work is done to code despite what bfa's inspector said. by the way, bfa's inspector was a friend of his. bfa still moves forward. bfa drags his feet with his bank and the closing keeps getting pushed back. mike is pissed at bfa. finally, we close. instead of being in a room together, mike and bfa are in separate rooms because they hate each other at this point and no one wants an explosion. bfa tries to renegotiate at the closing. mike literally yells, "he wants $100 because i don't have low flow toilets? i'll give him $100, but i'm going to jam it up his ass to my fucking elbow." i don't know if bfa heard it, but i would have loved to have seen the look on his face. now the revenge had on my behalf... the closer comes in near the end and says, "jane doe from xyz realty called to tell me to send her commission check to her office... i don't see that she's getting a check." i give her a copy of the contract and addenda and show her what my broker's wife added to it... not only did she have him sign an exclusive buyer broker agreement naming her as his designated agent, she also got him to write (and sign), in his own handwriting, "i inquired about this property because i saw myzyri's sign. my agent didn't accompany me when myzyri showed me the unit. broker's wife drafted my offer." this basically showed that the other realtor didn't do her job, so i wasn't paying her. (buyer's realtors are paid part of the seller's agent's commission.) so, i explained all this and on the advice of the seller's attorney, i amended my commission statement to give the other realtor a $50 referral fee. she cashed the check and called for weeks demanding her money. the chicago association of realtors reviewed her case and told her to get lost. as a side note, many years later, i saw that she had her license revoked for multiple ethics violations. and now, mike's revenge... about ten years later, mike's new wife died and he called me to sell that house because he was going to move into an assisted living facility. while talking with mike, he told me about the things he did before leaving the condo. the fans had no chains or switches. they were operated with remote controls. he taped the remotes to the tops of the fan blades and turned them on high before leaving the last time. he removed the super high quality garbage disposal that was super quiet and installed the cheapest and loudest one he could fine. he shut off all the water valves for the sinks and toilets. he poured straight bleach in the toilet tanks. he claims that will destroy the mechanisms in the toilet tank or at least drastically reduce the life expectancy. he put water restrictors in the showers. he removed the wheels from the bottoms of the sliding glass doors and left them in a kitchen drawer assuming bfa would just throw them out assuming they were junk. he turned the little pins on the igniter for the attached grill so they wouldn't create a spark. he disconnected the igniter on the oven. he didn't break it, he just loosened the connection. i think there were a few other things, but i can't remember what they were. he said he got a nasty letter from bfa's attorney about the doors, oven, and grill demanding to be paid for the service calls for the repairs. he ignored it and never heard anything else about it. tl;dr: lazy realtor doesn't do her job, but still expects to get paid a $5600 commission. she winds up with a $50 referral fee because she didn't involve herself in any step of the transaction. jerky buyer ticks off a seller who gets revenge by doing annoying things before leaving the condo for the last time. i guess you could say this borders the line of petty, and pro. you be the judge. so years ago, i moved to the city with no job. being as young as i was, finding a job was pretty hard. i asked my uncle if he could find me something at the auto dealership he worked at. i found my way into the lube bay. (oil changes, and basic maint.) i started in the summer, and man was it hot. hot engines, hot oil, and just general hotness. but as much as i felt like i was in hell, i would not let that affect my work. i was more than a lube tech. i was an a craftsman. if it was busy, i would make sure every last thing was done. new filter, vacuum all corners/under mats, record your tire tread depth, and rotate your tires if need be. if it was slow, i would go above and beyond. wash the inside of your windows, wash your wheels, blow out your air filters. overall i felt like i was a pretty solid worker, and did my job how i would want it done myself. all customers are different, and unique. some are appreciative (awesome.) some could care less (most people.) some are picky (not many though.) and some are just plain horrible. this is a story about the latter. this woman drove a purple minivan, and we shall call her mv. mv came in my first week. it was rather slow, and a grease-ball i work with asked me if i would take mv, so that he could go home early. grease-ball loved to go home early, and i loved making more money. so i said "yeah, no prob grease-ball." a lot-boy pulls the van up to my pit, and i crank out all the engine stuff. new oil, new filter, top off fluids, and go through my whole check sheet. done, no prob. now off to clean the car, i notice its dirty as i'm putting on new gloves, open then door and it hits me. this bitch smelt like a hot asshole, on a humid summer day in the ghettos of bombay! there were 2 car seats that were speckled by half eaten skittles, loli-pops, and boogers. the floors were trashed! juice bottles, milk shakes, cereal everywhere!! shall i go on? ok, an empty cd case,and 20ish dvds scattered abroad. tissues with god knows what on them. molding chinese food. dirty socks/underwear/and diapers. candy that had become part of the interior. mcdonald's bags, stuffed with garbage. and maybe even part of a dead horse. i'm not even sure. so i tough it out, and do my whole routine. dvds back in the case. dirty clothes bagged up, garbage emptied, floors vacuumed (as well as i could.) and car washed. i even got the inside windows! done, and good riddance. by far the worst vehicle i had in my first month. flash forward a few months. its busy as hell, and we are short staffed as its lunchtime. my next car pulls up, and wouldn't you know it. it belongs to mv. same purple van. same smell. same mess. and i had to do it. so i'm putting in my new mileage sticker (the one we put in the corner of your windshield so you know when you should get your next oil change.) and realize that has only been 1500-ish miles since last change. now we all tell you to change oil every 3000 miles, but that is just a big scam to get money from you guys. sorry, but its true. most cars on the road today,could go 6000 miles, or more before they need a change. but if you knew that, auto shops would loose a huge chunk of business. so i go over to my service manager, and ask him why they need an oil change? it's only been 1.5k! i plead, the oil is still good. he informs me that mv claimed that i had not changed her filter,and that i was going to receive a warning later, which could lead to termination, if i couldn't correct that error in service. that got me steamed. literally! i always changed oil filters!!! i had heard stories of cheap lube places, and how they would not change an oil filter, to increase store profit. but that isn't me. i mean like, wow. so what ever. i'm steamed, but i know after i finish this one, i will be on lunch. so i crank it out, and clean it up. just like i do for all my customers, and just like i did last time for mv. the next hour of leisure was well deserved. flash forward a few months, and mv is back. she is on a service plan,and gets scheduled oil changes every 6 months. (i guess the last one was free too, because of some loophole or something.) well a new guy gets mv, and i sympathize with him, as he gets the first wiff of mvs new winter smell. while he is changing the oil, i told him to make sure to change the filter. and i gave him a paint pen to mark it with. (we will sometimes mark your filter with a time-stamp. putting a dab of paint on your filter, and engine. that way we can tell if it has been tampered with, since your last visit.) i help him make a note of that in our system. so that we can see it, but the customer cant. i had a hunch she would be back. and wouldn't you know it. 1500 miles later it was back, and it was my duty. once again. talk with our service manager, show him the note, and the markings. he goes off to inform mv that the filter was changed, and that she would not be getting another service until 3000 miles. but before i returned the vehicle to her, i had to mess with her a little. i ever so carefully popped open a crevice of her dashboard, and threw a screw in there. and put the dash back in place. at 3000 miles, mv was back, but this time she went to a mechanic, because she needed to get a strange rattling noise checked out. so i went over to the mechanic, whom i got along pretty well with. i told him about our history with her, as well as the screw. and he got a pretty big kick out of that. i asked him to tell mv that it would take a lot of time, for that. as well as ordering some new parts. total cost was about 200$ more than the free oil changed, that she had accused me into doing. best part was, the tech told me he wiped off the old filter really well, and re-marked it. and for the first time, mv really didn't get her filter changed. **tl;dr** lady accused me of not changing her filter (but i did!) so i put a screw in her dashboard, and she ended up paying to get the rattling noise gone.first of all, this is a throwaway account. i'm not from a english speaking country, so for the nazis: take it easy. was told by a friend to tell this story here, so here it goes. this happened six years ago: there had been a new biker gang forming in my home town, there were already two other ones at that time but this new gang was being real jerks to normal people and they were annoying as shit. this gang had started harassing people at local bars and restaurants, just showing of and trying to make a name of them self. a few weeks later and they had now started riding their loud bikes through the neighborhoods, cunts as they are. about three to four times a week between 12am and about 1am. the police was contacted several times but nothing is changed. we in the neighborhood decided to take the matter in our own hands. we started talking to each other what we can do that wont hurt them, just something so they will stay away. we started talking about putting out obstacles and parking our cars on the street blocking as much as possible but still make a hard to ride through making a zick-zacking like pattern. just so he would slow down, bothered so he wouldn't come here any more. then we decided that a good old egging would sent a message. we talked to all the neighbors, told them our plans. if they had have enough, they should buy plenty of eggs and join us. the street i was living on was formed like a "u", with three apartment houses and about 40 apartments with the window (and some balconies) to the street. we said that we would sit up and just wait for him to come, have our windows open because you could hear him from a great distance. the first night he didn't come, we tried the next one. about 0:30 am, i hear him coming. the pulse is rising, this is it. he is finally entering our street. he sees the roadblock and slowly cruises forward, making as much noise as possible for the trouble we gave him. he takes the first obstacle and now the first apartments are starting to launch their eggs hitting him really good on the helmet and his bike. we blocked the road so much that if he wanted to turn around, he would have to fully stop several times. so he just went forward faster thinking it would be over. not in this neighborhood, he rode though a rain of at least 200 eggs. all soaked in eggs from head to bottom, as well as his bike, he was never to been seen in this area no more. victory! yes, we got eggs on our cars to but it was worth not having to deal with them waking us up at night. tl;dr:biker gang started making trouble in my neighborhood, got in one little fight and and got all scared (egged).in middle school i wasn't the most popular guy out there; in fact i was easy to pick on and admittedly a scaredy cat. i hate confrontation, i was bullied my whole life since elementary school and even by my "friends". well 7th grade year, this guy named d (for dick) had grown accustomed to slamming my books out of hand or unzipping my backpack all the way so that my stuff would spill out, pulling my pants down, tripping me, calling me names, and the list can go on for days. well he liked to wait for me before my 4th block out side on the breezeway. he would pick on me then, but he had started to get more violent. i remember to the day when he said "im gone kill you, you're a fucking mexican. not even the cool ones. pussy." i said "okay, just leave me alone. im gonna be late to class" then he said "i bet you like cock you fag. you want to see it faggot. i know you do" i said"i really don't want to see it i promise" he then proceeded to unbuckle his belt and act like it was his penis. i looked away and started to walk away, but he threw my shit on the ground. i bent down to get it and he slapped me with on the head (his belt) and was like "im gonna cum on you since you like gay shit". i head butted him in balls and ran off, but i started to cry and pretended it never happened. fast forward two days. i had luckily been able to avoid him, but i had to go the restroom during my technology lab block, and so i went to the restroom. i go in to a stall and finish my business and as i'm walking out he's right there, skipping class. i look down and go to the sink to wash my hands, but he notices me. he pushes me slowly against the wall and gets in my face. "you thought it was funny huh? hitting me in balls." i said "no, i was just tired of you calling me gay", he proceeds to call me any word he can in order to call me gay. my eyes start to water and try and run away, but again he grabs me says "where you think you going fag" he again unbuckles his belt and starts to grab it like it's his dick" he pushes me to the ground as i'm getting up he slaps me with his belt across the face. i pushed, but he's bigger and taller then me so it was pointless. he then proceeded to unbuckle his pants and show me his dick. i just closed my eyes and turned around and crawled out of the restroom. i get to class and pretend nothing happened. later that day he walks by me and the hallway and yells out "if i ever see you try and look at my dick in restroom again i'm going to beat the shit out of you" well everyone there heard it i looked down and pretend i didn't hear anything he said. the weekend goes by and i dread going back because i know ill see him again on tuesday in the hallway. tuesday comes and i see him waiting standing against a locker in the hallway. i was late to class by the way. he walks towards me and puffs his chest out. i look down and he says "trying to look again" i just didn't say anything. he does the shit with his belt again and his pants were sagging, but this time i started to yell "leave me the fuck alone!" a teacher rushes out and sees him holding what looked to be his dick in his hand and rushes towards me. he says "what in the world is going on?" i say "he's flashing his dick at me and bullying me, (im crying) and he won't leave me alone" the teacher calls the principle and the assistant principle. i get taken to the counseling office, he gets taken towards the principles office, and is apparently put in handcuffs by the school cop. i didn't want them to tell my parents, out of fear that i would get in trouble for not telling them. i see him a week later he had gotten expelled, and was getting something from his teachers. he was being escorted by the principle and looking down. people liked him as he was seen as the cool kid, but i was the loser mexican kid who had no friends. i got a lot of shit for getting him expelled by everyone, but no one seemed to care what happened to me. *edit* im sorry for the grammar and any other mistakes. it was a lot harder to write than i ever imagined when i was 17, i was working in a local theater that i was told would be a sweet job for pocket money. turns out that it was anything but. i was in a handful of different positions in that place, and i'm not going to make myself out to be a miracle worker; i did a good job, sure, but i made sure to have fun too. my immediate manager was pretty cool, to boot. very laid back, softly spoken, and liked to talk politics and history. it was the upper management that gave everyone a hard time. the gm in particular was a piece of shit, who loved to berate people. if he suspected you of a minor infraction, he'd nail you to the wall for it. anything bigger, and you were gone. his second in command was no better, either. she was a woman who dressed in flowing garments and looked goofy every time she came into work. i didn't have many problems with them, nor they with me, in the opening stages of the working relationship. halfway in was when they really started hammering people, myself included, over dumb things. i had to stay late after school one day, and it was a day off. i called them because i didn't have my schedule on hand to check and see when my next day in was. (it wasn't even the upper offices, just the phone that goes straight to the areas i worked.) second in command picks up the phone, and upon hearing that i was asking for information that was literally printed right next to the phone she was using, proceeded to berate me for "not being prepared". i swallowed my pride, disagreeing with it, but taking it. surely she had a point, and i should've been on-task with it. lapse on my part. so i shrug it off, and let it go. i come in the next day, and she makes a beeline for me fifteen minutes into my shift with a yellow piece of paper in her hand and a smarmy smile on her face. the second-in-command had written me up! "you are responsible for your own schedule! if this happens again, you're fired!" i was fuming. this *bitch*. all i did was ask for the next day i came in. i never had this problem anywhere else, for the record. only here. so immediately after that, i cared less and less about the job. every time we got berated and threatened with termination, my enthusiasm dropped a little more. we were teenagers, either still in high school or just out of it, and they were paying us minimum wage. how much blood were they going to try and get out of this stone? i wish i could say it got better, but it didn't. they would pass up minor tasks (a piece of trash on the floor) and approach an usher clear on the other side of the hallway or building and tell them to pick it up. they'd promise raises, and then deny them. they even began to deny discounts. it wasn't long before everyone got tired of their shit. by this point, i'd had enough. i was going to do something. i just didn't know what yet. my favorite thing to do back in high school was stink bombs. i'd crack them off in hallways, in classrooms. i never got caught. around this time, the chronicles of narnia was about to hit opening day, and i had morning shift. management had big expectations for this one and anticipated a lot of business, so i had my target. i thought about hitting the biggest auditorium in the place, where i knew the movie would be aired, and then caught myself. those little ampoules would get cracked, the rotten egg smell would erupt, then go away in thirty seconds... and everyone would know it was me. i needed something lasting. something with a lot more staying power than 30 seconds. what i ended up getting was a nine-pack of liquid ass. i didn't need nine bottles, but this was when i was a kid and had all the money in the world to spend on stupid things. it showed up one day before the big event, which had me sweating bullets, because i really wanted to do this and was worried about them coming too late. when they finally came in the mail pouch, i was jubilant. i was ready to do my dirty deeds. i had my uniform on, dressed for another day on the job, with two white vials of liquid ass in a cargo pocket. as we were about to open, ten minutes before we unlocked the doors, two ushers acted as lookouts while i snuck into the biggest auditorium in the house. i was correct in assuming they would choose this one for prince caspian. the carpeted walls acted as the perfect vehicle for the foul substance, transparent and silent as it jetted out of the squirt tip. i hit the back corridor under the seats, and both staircases leading up, terminating with the upper row. i expected a good lasting effect since i'd hit the perimeters of such a massive room. it really started to work as i was walking out, and i got blasted with the stuff as it began to waft. i will never forget that stink. it haunts me. as opposed to the stink bombs and the sulfurous odor i was accustomed to, this was in a league entirely of its own. the aggressiveness of the stench was something that took me aback and introduced me to a new world of repulsive, gag-inducing reek. it perfectly replicated its namesake: an open ass crack. satisfied, i walked out, counting on the putrid smell to do its job. i had two minutes to spare. no one would sit in there for an hour and a half. a concessions worker had asked what was going on, and we told him because we knew he wasn't going to open his mouth. he got curious, and started slowly towards the door. he didn't get very far. he couldn't even open the door without it hitting him. his hands flew over his face with a nauseated groan. i got back to work so that i wasn't suspicious and i had a clear vantage point. i would not be able to follow people inside, but i would be able to watch them leave. we unlock the doors, and people come in. here's where i feel guilty: some of them were parents bringing kids along. i leaned over the counter and watched people barrel in, and then barrel out. our management crew was on the scene in minutes offering up rainchecks and refunds, along with a weak deodorizing agent. they expected sales to go up tremendously thanks to prince caspian. this fell through, and a witchhunt immediately ensued. not wanting my pocket to tip off a manager that something may have been inside, i stuffed them inside trash and buried it in other things that needed to be thrown away. the asscrack smell lingered and lasted six days before they finally got rid of it. when they did, i quit. tl,dr: i liquid assed prince caspian.so, i had a "friend" in the 3rd grade. we'll call him chad. chad always liked to borrow things from me, because at the time, my family was fairly well off. not once, but twice he lent out what i lent him, and both times the second hand borrowers "lost" these items. once with a football, and once with an nes game. one day, i'm out taking pictures with my new $300 camera, and chad wants to borrow it. normally, i would have told him to kick rocks, but i had a plan to exact my revenge, so i let him borrow it. unlucky for him, i've been making "friends" with the person he borrows out my things to (yes, every time, it's the same guy.) so i'm at the guy's house a few days later, and per usual, he's loaned out my camera to this guy. i know because i see it on his shelf, and as a bonus, i see my nes game peeking out from beneath his bed. never found my football, though... so, anyway, as his mom calls to him, and as he leaves the room, i swipe my nes game and my camera, and shove them quickly into my bookbag. as he comes back, i tell him i have to go, and made up some lame excuse. the very next day, i make a show of asking chad where my camera is, because i want it back, and again, he makes a story about how he loaned it out and the second hand borrower "lost" it. at this point, i figured either he was selling my stuff to the guy or the guy was stealing it. either way, i couldn't care less. this time i made a specticle. i acted like i was fed up, and i stomped right down to his house to tell his dad what he did. come to find out, dad was saving up to buy chad a brand new go-kart, but ended up paying a good chunk of what he saved to me because of the camera his son "lost". he was also grounded for a month, and heard the belt smack him across the ass as i walked down the street. so i got my nes game back, as well as my camera, and a $300 asshole tax from his dad. he never asked to borrow from me again. tl;dr: asshole kid keeps lending out my stuff and ultimately getting it stolen, so i lend him my expensive camera, swipe it from the guy he inevitably loans it to, and have his dad pay to replace it.names changed to protect identities of all friends involved. when i was 19 all my close friends were at a college 3 hours away from our hometown. my plan was to attend the local junior college and then transfer after two years to the same college as them. 5 of my close friends had rented a 4 bedroom apartment 3 months in advance (the good apartments get booked early). it was 2 couples and my bro who was single: chandler and monica, rachel and ross, and joey. well rachel and ross broke up over the summer. 2 weeks into the fall semester ross couldn't take being around rachel anymore so he moved out. chandler calls me and asks me to move in. he is like dude just work down here until you are considered a resident then go to the junior college down here (becoming a resident would save me a lot of money on tuition). joey started telling me about all the hot college chicks down there and i was really missing my friends so i went for it. my father found me a good paying job through his work and i moved in. life was good for a long time. i worked all day and partied with my friends at night. at the start of the spring semester our friend phoebe transferred to the college and got a 2 bedroom apartment down the street. phoebe and rachel were really close. so rachel moved in with her and found a replacement named marcel. marcel was our new roommate and was a friend of a friend. rachel's friend had met him in rehab (for heroin). marcel seemed cool enough and was clean. he was a little wild and crazy. he liked to play the bongo drums but we were used to loud music. joey was a dj and would play loud music all the time. a few weeks go by and marcel started becoming a bad roommate. he wouldn't clean up after himself. he would stay up to like 6 am and eat all our food. he drank way too much and would leave our apartment in shambles. we would talk to him about it and he would get better. but he would always revert to being a shitty roommate after a couple weeks. then i lost my job, a job that paid well. suddenly i needed to find full time work in a college town. it was impossible because every restaurant or store could just hire part time college kids. so after a couple of weeks i had to start doing double shifts at a day labor company. if you are not familiar with day labor it basically sucks. you make minimum wage and they pay you in cash at the end of the day. the jobs vary from garbage man to factory worker. the majority of laborers were homeless people. i would show up at 5 am and work until 8 pm. this is when marcel and i start to have real problems. i would ask him to keep it down. i was really reasonable about it. you could play loud music and not wake me up. but marcel was playing music at the full volume of our stereo. luckily we only had a month on the lease before we would move out and not have to live with marcel. i had a car and would frequently drive other laborers to the job site. that’s how i met gunther who was hitchhiking across country and working on the same job as me. we got along right away. plus he was 22 and could buy us beer. so i offered up our couch as a place to stay while he earned enough money to travel to his next destination. i told him about marcel and asked him to help keep it quiet at night. monica, chandler, joey and i were very chill people. gunther was the exact opposite. gunther had a “don’t fuck with me” personality and was a big dude. i am 6’6 and pretty strong, he was just as tall but way bigger than me. i brought him to the apartment and introduced him to chandler, monica and joey as our new stereo bodyguard. it totally worked too. marcel didn’t pull any max volume stereo shenanigans at 4 am. a few weeks went by and it was great. finally we had to move. gunther and i had pulled a double shift during the day. it was about 11 pm when i went to bed in order to be ready to move in the morning. gunther, chandler and monica decide to get a late night snack together. about a half an hour goes by when marcel comes home drunk as fuck. he turns the volume up all the way on the stereo and starts dancing in the living room. joey comes out of his bedroom with a get a load of the balls on this guy look on his face. i had enough so i just go out in the living room and unplug all the wires connecting our dope ass sound system. it was joey’s and we had to unplug everything tomorrow anyways so fuck it. marcel is talking mad shit the whole time. i just ignore him and go back to bed. about 10 minutes later he starts playing his bongo drums as loud as possible. i had forgotten about them. so i go out there and am like shut the fuck up!!!! marcel starts taking off his shirt and pants. he is screaming, “let’s fight, let’s go pussy.” over and over. i tell him to fuck off and he grabs me by my collar. i basically just fall on him and proceed to pin him on the ground. marcel is screaming and talking shit the whole time while i pin him to the ground with joey laughing his ass off. gunther, chandler and monica walk in looking completely shocked. gunther is like “move i will beat his ass.” i am like “let’s just throw him outside.” we then proceed to throw him out the front door in nothing but his boxers. we lock the door and he is just screaming the whole time to let him back in. eventually the cops come and we explain the whole situation. they tell marcel that we don’t have to let him back in and he needs to leave. we wake up and starting moving our stuff. marcel doesn’t show up in the morning. we realize we have to move all his stuff out. i take his bongo drums down 2 flights of stairs and leave them on the lawn. then i am like fuck this bullshit, let’s just throw his stuff off the balcony. it was like a magical ballad of falling boxes, rugs, jeans and t-shirts. marcel finally shows up when we are finished. his mom was driving in to help him move back home but she wasn’t coming until tomorrow. he begs us to keep his stuff in the apartment but we just tell him to fuck off. he then starts hiding his stuff behind a bush next to the building and then leaves. now this is a college town which was pretty dirty all year round with lots of beer cans and litter everywhere. so the apartment complex was cleaned only once a year and that was today. so a 12 man cleaning crew came and threw everything he owned into the dumpster with all the other trash on the streets. we saw marcel digging through the garbage the next day with his mom. tldr; friendsthis is something i would never do again but something that i did in high-school when i was furious. a girl (call her c) i knew was raped. another girl (call her m) was always mean to her and to my group of friends in general. this girl bullied anyone who wouldn't retaliate. she slept with girls boyfriends, she faked being a lesbian and led a girl on for as long as she could for the attention, and went after c at every chance she could get. so one day when it was known that c was raped and m walked up and told her she was faking the whole thing. that the whole story was a lie and that no one would want to rape someone like c. i wasn't personally there but when i found out i was furious. i had a couple of friends that were younger and being only slightly in my circle of friends anyways, i figured i wouldn't be a suspect. i gathered my other scattered friends, and told them m's name. i mentioned that she did something to wrong a good person and that she deserved whatever they could come up with. the rumors started about m. she slept around a lot so having an std was believable. no one would sleep with her anymore. this was the only big rumor. it ended her ego. her friends even believed it. (i should mention that one of the boys she slept with frequently while he was dating another friend of mine, had chlamydia.) it worked. she left c alone and went into her own little world of drama. everyone knew one of us did it, or started it but i kept my mouth shut. no one knew about my friends, or about what i started. i never heard anything about it again until recently. she is still having trouble trying to get a boyfriend. apparently they want her tested before they go any farther. every one of them. this was a terrible thing to do. i know this, but i got my revenge and c got better without any trouble and no one got physically hurt. all i did was ruin her reputation. a couple of years ago i had a really shitty co-worker. we worked in it and he was a really bad programmer but thought he was amazing. he would add his own middle-ware that all connections to the database would go through and then decided to do changes in production without telling anybody, making our stuff malfunction because of his middle-ware. even worse, whenever something that he fucked up did go wrong and somebody complained, he looked around the room to see who wasn't there and blamed that person. this went on for years and we tried getting the manager to do something about it but nothing happened. he also bullied the rest of the it staff on a daily basis and was rude to pretty much anyone not a manager. after five years of putting up with his shit, we threatened to leave the company if he wasn't fired. all 7 of us, programmers, sys admins, everyone, gave the same ultimatum to the manager. fire him or we all resign on monday morning. he was fired that day. but wait - the revenge doesn't end there! a couple of years later i wrote a series of sick humor books, the kind of thing you don't want your name attached to. when i wrote the first one, i thought about what author name to use. i decided to use the name of my asshole former co-worker... now when you google his name, you find four pages of amazon pages for "his" books, reviews of them, google image search returns his face surrounded by copies of my books. the best thing is - i'm making a living selling books in his name! i did actually change the spelling of his name slightly so it's not the exact same. google still returns the books when you search for his name though.i've been lurking for awhile, and i finally have a story that i think fits with this subreddit. i debated whether it should go here or on r/badpeoplestories, but due to the climactic ending, i decided to post it here. allow me to start off by saying, i'm recently homeless. i'm not going to go into a whole sob story about it, but i have shitty credit, so nowhere in town will rent to me without a roommate, i have no friends who need roommates, and i sunk all of my money into rent and deposits on a series of unlivable roommate matching situations. i've been at the local homeless shelter for a little over two weeks. i'm a small/average early 20's female who looks younger than i am, so i have this very sweet/innocent vibe about me. i met a lot of the people here, and got along with most of them, but primarily bonded with a small group of about 4 people; a heterosexual married couple and a former drug lord trying to get his life on the right track. i was friendly with everyone else too though, including this girl in a wheelchair missing one leg. little did i know that she would soon be known to me only as rollercunt, and the series of events that would ensue as a result of this amputee trash bag. before this all happened, i liked to buy nice things for myself. i dress in the latest fashions, own a somewhat recent model laptop, had a 3ds before i had to sell it for food, and until a week ago, a nice, several hundred dollar phone as well. i made the mistake of leaving it next to the toilet in the bathroom one time while i was in a hurry (yes, i am well aware that it is a bad idea to leave things in bathrooms, i don't need to hear it for a 57th time this week), and within the 10 minutes it took me to realize i had left it, it had vanished.\ rollercunt was very vocal about "i can't believe someone would steal her phone, whoever did it give it back!" while i cried in the corner over the fact that i had just began the hiring process for a new job and now had no way of contacting the company i hoped to work for to acquire necessary paperwork. however, upon reviewing the surveillance footage from the hall outside the bathroom, rollercunt was the only person in there between when i left it and when i went back to look for it. later in the day, she came back drunk with a guilty conscious, told me she had found my phone ditched between the shelter and bus stop, but had accidentally left it in her friend's car and would bring it back the next day. the next day came, and her addiction won out. she changed her story and said it was a different brand of phone than the one i had, then went and sold it for $50 to drink more. not long after, they caught her on camera stealing cash and cigarettes from someone else, and every day from then on, they caught her on video stealing something else, leaving quickly after, and coming back with a pocket full of cash and a bottle of booze. stealing is supposed to get the perpetrator banned, but they take pity and let her stay because she's a cripple. as far as i'm concerned, she's a lying thief first and a disabled individual second, and should not get special treatment for missing a leg. but let's continue... after coming back from selling the phone, she asked to buy a cigarette off of me. i keep multiple packs on me so i can sell individual smokes for a quarter each, and i needed bus money, so i agreed. she handed me a nickel, and i told her i couldn't sell her one for that, the price was 25¢ and not negotiable. she started going off about how i wouldn't sell her a cigarette, this is what she gets for her honesty. i snapped. "then where the fuck is the phone, bitch!? i know you took it, the police came and reviewed the video feed today and saw you going in after me, and you want to talk about honesty?". she looked busted as fuck, but tried to deny the police had even been there (they had been) before wheeling her ass out of the building as quickly as possible and disappearing for awhile. never long enough though. rollercunt didn't like being called out on her shit, so she took to wheeling by me and calling me an ugly slut on a multiple times daily basis. i ignored it for awhile, since i'm aware that i'm attractive to many people, she looks exactly as you would expect a chronic drunk to look (haggard as fuck), and she regularly fucks a rotating cast of guys here in public areas, whereas i don't see anyone here like that. after about half a week of it though, i decided it was going to end, one way or another. i was sitting in my usual corner, watching netflix with my headphones in right before lunchtime. people started filtering into the dining area, so i started shutting down my laptop to pack away and go eat. when i started closing everything out that makes sound, i saw her roll by and heard her call me a slut. i explained for the umpteenth time what the word "slut" actually means and how she's confused about which of us it applies to, and she starts wheeling around, yelling like she wants to fight. i stood up and asked her if she was going to do something or just keep running her mouth, and she wheeled up in front of me real fast, still running her mouth. i didn't realize it at the time, but rollercunt actually made the first move. dumb bitch thought she was going to stand up on her one leg and fight me. i grabbed her by the hair, pulled her the rest of the way up, and threw her out of the chair. one of her friends, we'll call him tweak (because he's a tweaker) pushed a pile of mats stacked next to us over in an attempt to have them land on me, but hadn't realized i stood up out of the way. they did cause me to lose my balance though, so we landed with me sitting with my back against the wall and her entire body in my lap. i punched her in the face repeatedly with one hand while ripping out chunks of hair with the other. a staff member finally got us to stop, i sat there in a daze for a few seconds (i don't normally just up and start beating on people), and she was laying across my lap crying "you pulled my hair...". i looked at her like she was a piece of shit stuck to my shoe and kicked her off my lap, her body comically rolling across the floor. the staff separated us, i continued to sit quietly in my corner and wait for police while she continued sobbing "she pulled my hair... *sniff* she pulled my hair...". the police came, and i remained calm and polite while explaining the situation truthfully. they ended up arresting tweak because he had several outstanding warrants. rollercunt was asked to leave the shelter for the rest of the day. what i think is the best part of the entire revenge is, the police decided not to punish me. i didn't go to jail, i didn't get a citation, they didn't set a court date, nothing. i'm not proud that i had to beat on a cripple, but i did what needed to be done, and the fact that i didn't get in trouble for it gives me some sort of pride. oh, and another upside to the whole situation; the fight happened yesterday, and nobody has had anything stolen from them since.credit to /u/_tixcy_ for submitting this story originally. i thought it was too good not to share. [first post]( [update] thank you thank you thank you to everyone for all your awesome ideas on how to catch this bitch. seriously. there was a ton of replies and i had to get up early because i was working for another girl this morning so i didn't have much time to respond to everyone. for starters, yes, i know i have a shitty manager. no big secret, most of us hate her, but we can't fire her. we're not corporate, either. so it's pretty much her + the owner who run things, and he's not around much. another thing, yes, ashley makes $13 an hour. i'm not a business owner so i don't know exactly how it works, but 1/3 of her income is cash. from what i understand, to get around paying overtime and health insurance, the owner pays out the kitchen staff, bussers, and dishwashers in cash so it looks like no one is working 40+ hours a week. also, ashley makes $13 an hour to pick up plates and put them in a cart. she doesn't wash the dishes. we have another guy who does that. she also doesn't even work close to 40 hours a week so i'm not sure why her entire check isn't reported but that's just how it is. yes, we're in deep shit with the irs. no use reporting it, they already know. anyway. so i called another server (nicole) last night and just flat out told her everything i'd written here. she started crying, and said she suspected someone was doing it but ashley was always such a sweetie, and she couldn't believe she would do that. she didn't deny ashley doing it, just that she felt like ashley had stabbed her in the back over it. apparently ashley "borrowed" $200 from that server a few months ago because she claimed her parents were going to turn her phone off and she felt bad for her. so she's stealing and getting money from her, too. nicole said she'd handle it, so i figured she meant she'd talk to the manager since they're on pretty good terms. when i got to work, ashley was already there. i made sure to grab any tips off my tables before she bussed them, and breakfast went okay. when we switched to lunch, nicole came over and said, "hey, table #11 left me $12, there's a ten and two ones." she said it really flatly and then was like, "see?" and pointed at it. by then the table was long gone, had already paid, and ashley just needed to bus it. cool. as soon as we saw ashley go toward that section, nicole &amp; i walked behind the server line where we could see her. we clearly saw ashley scoot the $10 underneath a plate, pick the plate up, toss it in the cart, and then dump it in her apron pockets. she left the $2 on the table. nicole just said okay, that's that then, and called the manager over. we told her everything, about my tips, about my friend losing tips, and how nicole had noticed it too. my manager said basically what i had about maybe a customer did it, and then we told her how that table had left $12, ashley took the $10 and left the $2. manager called ashley over and asked her to empty her pockets. all she had was the $10 in her apron. oookayyy. ashley started crying, couldn't believe we'd accuse her of stealing, but my manager sided with us and gave the money back to nicole. ashley then decided the only way out of the situation was to make up some huge story about it. she said the table came over to her, told her what a great job she was doing, and told her they'd left a $10 on the table for her. at least my manager wasn't stupid enough to believe that. manager pulled her into the office and i assume told her she was fired because she came back out crying and grabbed her stuff and left. unfortunately neither of us have a record of what's been stolen because we don't know all of it, but i told my manager about the guys from friday and how they usually leave me $60, and the table from the other day. manager said since we didn't have proof of all of it, she didn't want to take it out of what she needed to pay ashley. said she'd call the owner and ask what he wanted to do about it, plus she didn't have proof aside from my word basically that those guys would have left me $60. it sucked, but i understand that i guess. when my shift ended, my manager asked me to come in the office and said the owner told her to go ahead and give me $100 to "make up for it" and that he was sorry and thanked us for telling them about it. not gonna complain about that, because that definitely covers what i think ashley's taken from me since i haven't work with her in so long. i know nicole works with her more so i'm not sure what they plan to do about that, but she doesn't really have any proof or any way to calculate how much she's lost from it. sooo... fortunately, my manager acted like a decent human being for once and actually managed a situation. didn't have to mark any bills or get any customers involved, thank god, so i'm pretty happy with how it turned out. i'm not really sure how far you're supposed to go in a situation like that, but i hope ashley doesn't get a job somewhere else and try to fuck people over. and nicole talked to the manager about borrowing $200 to ashley, and the manager said she was going to call her parents when she got off that night and tell them what had happened. i realize it's not really the managers job to get money back on a personal loan like that, but i hope for nicole's sake that ashley's parents will offer to pay her back or something. =/ edit: this isn't my story folks, the credit belongs to /u/_tixcy_ alone.i'm a pretty decent guy. sometimes i see ads on craigslist for people who need small loans and i help them out. it is always a 0% loan, but they need to provide good collateral. so i met this guy, we can call him dave. he needs $300 and i agree to loan it to him. he has a hard time coming up with collateral. he gives me an electronic keyboard, an iphone, a digital camera, a silver necklace, and a seahawks jersey. i tell him before he signs the loan document that i made up that he needs to decide now if he is actually going to pay me back, he will regret not paying me back. i make that very clear to him. he agrees and i give him the money and he goes on his merry way, i keep his stuff. my first mistake was taking collateral that really wasn't worth $300, but i was feeling generous and was bored with life and needed an adventure. he had told me that the iphone was a 4s, but it turns out it was a 4, so that was even worth less. it was also still attached to his account that was in default, so it was only worth parts. bummer, i should have been more careful when checking that out, i know better. so that two weeks pass and he is supposed to pay me back. he says he can't come up with the money and is willing to pay the $50 late fee that we had built into the contract. i agree and again warn him that not paying back won't work out well for him. after a month he is now in "default" and needs to pay me back. he starts coming up with excuses. of course he uses the oldest one in the book, "my dad died and i have to pay for the funeral". "ok", i say, calling his bluff, "i'm sorry for your loss, i want to help out, if you can give me some proof of his death, then i'll forgive the loan." of course he can't do that and promises he will still pay me back. a few more weeks go by and it is obvious he isn't going to pay me back and is completely ignoring me. so i start selling his stuff. i get $45 for the jersey, $30 for the necklace, and had the keyboard stolen from my car. but then that cell phone! he hadn't bothered deleting his data. so i start texting his family asking about his dead dad. of course magically he contacts me right away, again with excuses. this time it was, "in my grief i was so angry that i broke my phone, just got a new one today." i tell him that he needs to pay me back and at this point he refuses. so my next step is i text his ex-girlfriend. i ask her if she would have any need for dave's phone. she gets pretty excited and asks if there is any proof of him doing drugs in the last year. i find some texts about buying drugs and a picture of him smoking mj. i take screen shots and stuff and she tells me she needs that for their custody battle. after that i dig deeper into his data. he's got a current girlfriend, a really cute girl. way out of his league. but apparently he is also contacting hookers and escorts on craigslist, has an ashley madison account and a plenty of fish account. so guess who gets an anonymous tip about his bad behavior. you guessed it, the current girlfriend. she freaks out and wants all the info i can give her. on top of all his cheating, half of the collateral was either stolen from her or was a gift from her. she even told me that he kept lying about the seahawks jersey, that she had just given him for a birthday, saying he left it as a friends house. next thing i know, i'm checking his facebook account and he has been kicked out of their apartment and he's now back living with his parents like the loser he is. i end up keeping the cell phone for a while and then replacing the motherboard with a good one and selling it. i send him [this picture]( in an email with the caption, "this is all it took to break up you and your girlfriend, i told you that you would regret not paying me back. was she worth $300?" tl:dr guy wouldn't pay back $300 loan. i got his gf to break up with him.[*warning: relationship story ahead.* i usually pass on interpersonal drama stories but since i have one, i'm sharing mine just in case it's somebody else's cup of tea. skip the next paragraph if you're already familiar with borderline personality disorder.] *(backstory)* i once dated a guy with borderline personality disorder. i had never heard of that disorder before and he certainly didn't disclose it while we were together but i slowly learned all about it over the course of my time spent with him. if you don't know the type, he was very intense: i felt like we packed three years of relationship into 9 months of dating. he had to always be doing something new because sitting still was agonizing. he was emotionally unstable but due to being an attractive extrovert, he made friends easily and quickly, but usually only maintained them so he could exploit them later. he was the master of manipulating the emotions of others so that you'd do anything he wanted. he had a perfect memory and this ability to twist around my own memories of events so that even i couldn't remember what accurately happened. he lied about anything just to see if he could get away with it and he was narcissistic to top it all off. one thing i should say is that he was *hot*. and i mean he was stupidly, ridiculously attractive but somehow was the most paranoid and insecure person i'd ever met. i was young and naive and he was so insanely hot that i thought it was something of a miracle that he was even into me in the first place. the sex was mind-blowing but he started to use that against me over time, too. i did a lot of things i'm very ashamed of. as an example of how stupid i was, he managed to get me to "let" him hook up with other women but of course he would get so completely jealous if one of my male friends even vaguely appeared to be hitting on me. he called me a whore and slut and insinuated that i did the most horrifically dirty things to men behind his back when he wasn't around. i was in my senior year of university at the time so i did a *lot* of studying on campus with my peers. he couldn't stand it. he ruined a lot of my friendships and, just when i was starting to see him for what he was, he managed to get me addicted to several drugs from the 'party scene' that he had access to somehow. my self-confidence was non-existant at the end of our relationship and i was completely dependant on him for any sort of validation or self-worth. *(story)* he had moved in with me since he was/is essentially a grifter. no credit cards, no steady employment, no permanent address except those people he mooched off of, obscenely heavy in debt because he never paid off medical bills for his numerous trips to the er to score pain meds... he always had weird "schemes" (i guess you could call them that) to get money but they rarely paid off like he thought they would. he had nice clothes (that showed off his seriously ridiculously nice body) and expensive electronics like his laptop and ipad and iphone but other than that he was a drifter. he'd go out of town on "business trips" -- and *yes*, i know how incredibly cliche that is -- where of course he was partying, sleeping with women and doing god-knows-what to earn cash under the table. to this day i have no idea what his regular source of income was, but i don't think he was a drug dealer just from what i've learned about him over time. *(revenge)* i'm a girl but i'm a bit of a dork. or at least, i know how to use computers better than he ever did. i eventually found all his hidden laptop pictures and his cloud photo storage. i once sat there and watched his iphone upload live sexcapades to his cloud.. i was an emotional wreck but i kept it together. eventually i had kicked enough of the drug habit to operate independantly of him long-term and i started collecting "evidence," though i didn't know for what. i think i just needed something tangible to hold on to to tell myself what i was going through was real. so i copied all his text conversations on his phone when he was asleep, i copied all his hard drive pictures, and then i finally contacted the woman who seemed to be his main girl when he was away from me and gushed everything i had discovered. turns out he was essentially doing the same thing to her. you could tell he had "a type" because she was almost a mirror of me: dark-haired, short, skinny but with ample....um, tracts of land..., and totally clueless about the whole thing. but unlike me she had a furious temper. she destroyed his phone and ipad while he was seeing her up in new york and she had me erase all his pictures off his cloud and then shatter his laptop with my car several states to their south. he called me the next day with what was another iphone that he must have bought out of pocket. he didn't know about my part of his recent turn of events but i told him i knew what he had been up to and that i set all of his personal effects outside in cardboard boxes and told him he'd better collect them before the bad weather we were slated to have over the next several days. he was pissed and didn't believe me and never came home that week. meanwhile all his stuff sat outside and got rained on all week. oh, and my cat may have used the bathroom on his nicest clothes before i boxed them up, too. he eventually showed up that next weekend with the other girl by his side. i don't know what was going on that she was still around but i suspect he was owing her a lot of money and that she intended to collect it by keeping him on a short leash. either way, that was the last i ever saw of him: collecting all his ruined personal effects and driving away in a rental car. i learned later that when she was done with him, the other woman turned him over to the police because he had warrants in four states. *(epilogue)* he berated me on almost a daily basis for several months afterward, alternating between trying to make me feel worse about myself than i already did and then trying to get me to forgive him and take him back. he threatened to kill himself and i suggested that he might want to seriously consider it, considering i had just given his parent's phone number and home mailing address to all the debt collectors that were harassing me at the time. he couldn't *fathom* that i had grown a backbone, much less gotten one over on someone as brilliant as him.. he finally resorted to vulgar name calling and trying to use my demeaning sexual past with him to bring me back down but it didn't work. i never blocked him because i wanted him to keep sending me sob stories of how i ruined his life and what difficulties he was having now because of me. it was all very empowering. he almost caused me to fail and drop out of my senior year of college but i somehow managed to get through by the skin of my teeth and, after getting myself clean and doing a little counseling, i'm doing quite well for myself. edit: formatting and general clean-up. i'm a wordy writing so i have to edit myself down to not sound like i'm rambling. edit 2: i have been informed by several of you that my ex probably had antisocial personality disorder. he and i did see a psychologist at one point where she threw out numerous terms that might be applicable to his situation, apd and bpd included. narcissistic personality disorder was on the list, too, and odds are he has several things going on at once; not one simple thing to blame. and speaking of blaming, i do want to apologize to those of you with borderline personality disorder who felt that i was attacking him due to his mental issues alone. i assure you that my totally awesome revenge was purely due to the actions he took against me (like the lying, the cheating, the stealing, the physical and sexual abuse, the exploitation, and the ruining of relationships of both family and friends. i thought the story made it clear why revenge was warranted but if you somehow thought it was an attack on you personally because you share a similar diagnosis with my own personal demons, then i apologize. thank you for informing me that i'm just as bad as he was.im on mobile so sorry for formatting. quick backstory; i ride my bike to the gym with my friend patrick everyday and lock it on the bike rack. i get out of the gym, look at the bike rack and only see one bike. i look to my friend patrick and say "where's your bike?" he turns and says "where's your bike?".. i soon realize the bike missing is mine. my bike cost me $250. for a 17 year old highschool kid without a job thats a fortune. i call the police. they can't do much because my local l.a fitness doesn't have cameras. i filed a stolen item report. a few days later at 10:30pm my sister calls me. she sees my bike at 711. i throw on clothes and start sprinting. it's about a 5 minute drive with traffic. my adrenaline keeps me running. when i arrive i find out that my sister confronted him and he rode off. my sister told me it was a homeless man with a ponytail and a tattoo on his neck. the 711 owner said he's local, comes everyday. i was hopeless after a month goes by. i looked at every bike i saw.. today my mom was driving me to the gym and i see 2 homeless men riding bikes in the middle of the road. when we pass them my vision was in slow motion. it was my bike. the guy with the pony tail and tattoo was on a white bike. i tell my mom to pull up down the road. i get out of the car and slowly walk towards them. i scream in my deepest voice "excuse me, that's my bike" i said it in a stern voice, im 6"4, 215lbs. they acted like they didn't hear me and tried nonchalantly riding passed me. they didn't speed up. i closeline/tackled the man off my bike. adrenaline pumping i said "i said that's my fucking bike" the man with the tattoo looked shocked, wasn't expecting this to happen. we get in a heated argument, i hop on my bike and ride home. if they ever try to find me for revenge i'll kill both of them. edit : the reason i tackled him off my bike is because he was with the homeless man with tattoo on his neck and a pony tail. i wouldn't have done it if i wasn't certain. edit #2 : im done arguing with people who disagree what i did. you will be ignored. and i wouldn't fucking kill them for no reason, i said if they try and get revenge. fyi places and names have been changed. i was desperate for work and i happen to walk into a store i shop at regularly and was okay acquaintances with the boss. he offered me a job and offered to train me up since he needed reliable people. in a month i was his star employee, filling in for the ones who call in sick, fixing problems, working my ass off and also smashing sale targets, with him saying ill train you, since at that point he hadn't besdies how to put through a sale. then one day he came up to me and mentioned id been making mistakes, and all the little ones were adding up. i said but you only gave me basic till training and his response "you should know by now". then the shift cutting happened and then i found out he started talking real horrible stuff to other employees behind my back. the assistant manager actually felt sorry for me but i was constantly badgered. like if i even looked away for a second id have my assistant manager going dont ignore that customer.. two seconds prior they were not even there they literally just lined up, or as i said hey im doing this first they would ignore what i said and say yes you need to do that first not x. treated like dirt, no other employees even wanted to talk to me. the plotting. so at first i stopped doing things that implicated me in wrong doing as i suspected i was being blamed for stuff i never did, i documented it thoughly, pictures, a diary, you name it. when my manager went on longer than normal breaks i time clocked it on my phone and wrote it down. then he fucked up and wrote a mass text to everyone calling us names for fucking up. i screen capped that immediately as the next day he asked to delete that message as it was a prank. (bullshit) he stood over me and watched me delete it. i also wrote this down. i tried to be friendly with my co-workers but they barely said a word to me but to shut up and keep working. my last shift there (i didnt know it was at the time) i was so over it, i was being super nice to people and gave them deals that i knew i could do, just to at least feel like a human and get some sort of enjoyment in work. this didnt go down well as i got a talking out to with me ending the conversation with i dont really care anymore. in the process i was looking for a new job and a day before my performance review by my manager i was offered a new job, starting immediately as of tomorrow. this was a blessing and i sent a message to my manager that i wont be coming in as i quit, he never responded but my asm did and said okay you dont get store discount anymore. not even a sorry to see you go. but wheres the revenge? oh it came i waited 4 months after i left. i let the dust settle and then i got everything into order and sent a lovely huge email to my regional manager. the thing is they all forgot i was on very good terms with him, to the point he was sad that i left. i wrote down a few things saying i felt after all this time this needed to be aired out and that i was told i have a legitimate claim for workplace harassment, but i wanted to deal with you first. i had a huge response saying they would look into this right away, an apology that this happened all i asked was to stay anonymous. i got a response 3 weeks later saying he was no longer representing the company as a way for me not to pursue legal action. after that response i decided to buy something from that store. apparently my ex manager did not see it coming, they dumped a head office employee in his store to watch him for week and scrutinised everything he did, even if he coughed wrong it was noted they then asked him to explain the mass text message of abuse and they used all i sent him plus the head office report to fire him. (in my country you need a fuckload of evidence to fire fulltime contracts) the causals are now being split up into other stores as well to kill the group. they still have no idea i did it. the asm was shocked as he thinks someone in the store did it for personal gain or a promotion. i know it seems perfect but with the regional ive known him when he used to be a causal in that very store and we got along great and kept in contact for years after he got promoted. i was lucky in that respect as many people dont have higher connections like that. how do i end this... well im now in fulltime employment, his facebook feed is filled with complaints about no money. karma bitch. not sure how pro this was but here it is anyway. a friend of mine put an ad in the local paper looking for a flatmate and had to go through the odious task of meeting and choosing one. this guy called her up and was sounding a little weird. he started asking her if there was enough room for his suits in the wardrobe and she said that she thought so, but he wasn't convinced and kept going on about it. she quickly put him in the no category and when he asked for the address, she balked and made an excuse about not knowing when she could show him. she got his number and told him that she'd call him when she had time. he called back a couple of days later after not hearing from her and she told him that the room was taken. he got abusive and called her a number of names so she hung up. this guy called a couple more times over the next few days to tell her what a bitch she was. this guy was a total asshole, and my friend felt unsafe but luckily he only called a couple of times. we waited a couple of weeks and i placed an ad in the free section of the local paper. because it was free, there was no payment for the ad and no way to trace it apart from the throwaway email address that i made. the ad read something like. free armani suits. i'm going overseas and am giving away my entire collection of immaculate armani suits. first in, takes the lot. this guy started getting calls at 5:30 in the morning from every secondhand dealer, bargain hunter and who knows who else..i know because i called him at about 11:00am and he was going nuts. it was hilarious and i wish that i'd recorded it. he figured that someone had placed the ad and gotten the number wrong. i ran the ad again the following week with the same results :)this is my story of malicious compliance. i used to work for a large heavy equipment rental company. we had a large fleet of equipment, plus pickup trucks for operators that included fuel pumps for the equipment when on a job site for extended periods of time. in the beginning, i was a parts runner with the shop manager (nosferatu, because that is how he looked) as my direct supervisor. then there was the branch manager (dong, because that is what he is) who oversaw everything. dong lived up to his namesake. had a military style flat top even though he never served, and yelled constantly. my sister also worked for this company, and he constantly berated her for, get this: doing her job properly. she got her own malicious compliance in, but was eventually "laid off" when the company hit a rough patch (turned out to be the best thing ever because she now has a far better job). dong continued to talk crap about everybody, and any time i would approach him regarding things i heard he told other on my work ethic, he claimed he never said it. if i am doing my job wrong, i want to improve, but he claimed i was doing everything right. yet when my reviews came around, his comments were always negative and i would not get a raise. nosferatu and the assistant service manager were fired because they brought guns to work and were firing them into boxes in the office after hours. i was offered the role of assistant service manager for that branch and our neighboring branch, which also meant the service manager of the neighbor branch was to oversee both (we'll call him gonzo, because) and became my direct supervisor. also, i was now considered a corporate employee, so dong had no control over my position. he tried his best to fuck with me (trying to change my schedule, make me spend more time in his branch, etc), and while i *tried* to comply, it wasn't with much effort. my boss spent more time in dong's branch and i spent more time in the other because we lived closer, respectively, and we could divide and conquer. the system was working well and we were bringing the maintenance department into the current age (technologically). during this time, the company installed gps units on every piece of equipment (that was rented) and pickup truck. we could track running times (for billing purposes) and pickups were sending alerts if someone drove over 65mph (really fucking annoying). the amount of data i could pull was amazing, and we only opted for about 1/4 of the options. one morning, a tractor we used at dong's yard was missing. it didn't have gps, but there was a truck with a trailer (capable of towing the tractor) hooked up next to the shop. on a whim, i checked the gps for the truck, and the night before it went directly to dong's house and came back early that morning. i downloaded a few reports, created a new gmail account, and sent everything to our corporate office anonymously. 2 days later, the tractor was back and i never heard anything. some time later, dong demands that we wire a specific truck's gps unit to send a signal when the auxiliary fuel pump gets turned on. simple work, and something the company should have opted for to begin with (one extra wire), but he wanted to set up a certain operator who was believed to be stealing fuel. [i tried to explain that this is unethical]( and potentially illegal (had no idea if it was actually illegal), and dong just screamed at me that he would have his buddies in corporate fire me. when he left my office, i called gonzo and the head of maintenance to cover my ass. gonzo, thinking ahead, requested if we could start doing this on all of the trucks which the head of maintenance said yes. he asked me not to tell anybody but the mechanics about it. sure enough, the night the operator took the truck home, the fuel pump was turned on in 3 locations on his property. he was promptly shitcanned, and dong was stiff with satisfaction (see what i did there?). months later, we have all of the trucks in our branches wired to the fuel pumps, and i have long forgotten about it. i'm at work in the neighbor branch while gonzo is at dong's, and he calls me from his cell phone: &gt;gonzo: hey, dude. can you pull up the gps on truck xyz? &gt; &gt;me: are you fucking blind? it is right outside your office window! &gt; &gt;gonzo: no shit! where did it go last night? &gt; &gt;me, now understanding and a couple clicks later: dude... it went to dong's, and the fuel pump was on for 15 minutes... &gt; &gt;gonzo: we filled that tank up last night for a job today (100 gallons) and it is bone dry now. print the reports and send them to me. now, i knew my boss was going to report this. he had friends in corporate too. but i also knew how things get swept under the rug in the company which our parent company must have known when they implemented a third party "ethics hotline" where we could report anything. and dong was adamant about us using it. so, i did. i took the gps reports, the video from our cameras (showing the yard guy filling the saddle tank and dong later leaving with the vehicle), and a summary of what i believe happened all from the anon gmail account. the ethics hotline was required to report everything to the company and follow up to get a resolution. i knew at the bare minimum i would receive a response. my prayers were answered a week later when the head of safety (r. lee ermey) was in our area for his "routine visits." r, like his name sake, was a retired marine drill instructor. kind as can be in general, but takes no shit and isn't afraid to tell you. his first stop when he visited was my office. as i knew when sending everything to the ethics hotline, it would easily be traceable to me, i just didn't want it in writing. r knew what was up, and we went through everything together. without saying as much, i knew he agreed with my findings. he was disappointed i did not come to him first, but he also understood my mistrust in the system for previous issues (before he was with the company). r made the rounds talking to others and got the same general story from everybody that dong was 250-pounds of tube steak. by then end of the week, it was announced that dong was leaving the company, and the two branches would now entirely act as one while remaining physically separate. all of our jobs were made significantly easier because nothing was separated anymore, and we didn't have a walking phallus spewing off constantly (i did it again). i never spoke to dong again, however, he does show up on my linkedin recommendations often. every time i see his name, i view his profile. years later, he has no new employer (he was close to retirement) and he says he is a "construction consultant". i take constant joy in knowing he gets to see my face for viewing his profile and he can see me moving up at my new company. edit: added link to why i felt it was unethical per /u/jbourne0129's question below.this story happened in about 12 years ago. i was working for a company that owned intellectual property rights to some automotive after-market tech, headquartered in phoenix, arizona. in 2002 the owner of the company suggested to his employees the possibility of relocating the whole business to san diego. the company was very small (only about 5 people in the whole org) and all of the co-workers knew each other and were more or less friends either with each other or with the ceo. the boss insisted that we all had a vote and if anyone voted against the move the company would stay. we all voted unanimously to move to san diego and our first couple years we ended up all living in the same apartment complex in mission valley. the new office location was intentionally headquartered across the street from the apartment community, which as you might imagine was very convenient. in those days i drove a new pickup truck and since my office was across the street i didn't drive my vehicle much except on weekends or special trips. as a result the vehicle remained parked for long periods of time in the covered parking area of the garage. one day i went out to my vehicle to find a hefty trash bag dumped in the back of my truck. naturally i found it a bit creepy and off-putting. when i hopped onto the bed of the truck to haul it out i found to my utter disgust that it was dripping wet with juices from rancid meat of some kind -- i think probably chicken. at this point i angrily decided that i was going to figure out who did this, even if i have to manually sort through every item of trash in this stinking kitchen bag. i donned some latex gloves and went to work, fishing item-by-item, piecemeal from the rotting trash bag. eventualy i struck paydirt: i found a utility bill envelope that had been crumpled up. i opened it up and discovered that the culprit was one of my co-workers who fancied himself a bit of a prankster. said offender (i'll call him cam) lived in the same apartment phase as i did, just a few doors down. first a little context: back in those days i was fascinated with lockpicking. i owned among other things a lockpick gun which admittedly requires very little skill to operate; aside from that it is convenient because they are quicker than using a rake or individual picks. i also owned some basic phone testing equipment, including a graybar telco lineman testset. with some effort i succeeded to locate the telco phone utility closet on my floor and was able to let myself in. i don't remember if i had to use an ani line to identify cam's circuit or whether the termination points were labeled but i did manage to locate the ring and tip for his pair. then using the lineman set i was able to use '*70' to activate the call forwarding feature (this was sbc at&amp;t in those days). i forwarded all of his calls to the local jack-in-the-box restaurant. more context: my co-workers all teased me incessently because i refused to eat at jitb because.. well, i simply didn't like the food. this would make it subtlely obvious at some point that i was the person responsible since jitb was a running office joke by this time. after forwarding his line i cross-connected the ring and tip which shorted the line out (status: line was dead and calls were forwarded to jitb). i let cam believe that i had hacked his phone service provider's switch (yes, he was gullible) and let him beg for two days before undoing the damage. meanwhile everyone in the office thought it was the funniest revenge they had ever heard of and agreed the response was appropriate. btw, yes this really happened, apologies in advance to /r/thathappened ;-)this dates back to 1992 when i lived with my parents in a university town. we used to have students live next door and a little downhill from us, and they'd continually park their cars inside our property near a dodgy fence between our properties. their place was full of junk and only had one accessible driveway where one of the longer-term students would always park. dad was a lawn-proud man, and while he was incredibly patient with these guys, and would ask them repeatedly to move their cars, he hit breaking point one weekend there was a big race in town. half a dozen visiting student guest shitbox cars ended up in our lawn, and he went around to protest, saying it'd gone beyond ridiculous, especially in wet weather when it'd be likely to damage his lawn all the more. they promised like they always did that they'd get the cars out and not park there ever again but hey - the race was on, they all wanted to watch it and have a decent sunday and they'd leave them there until the race was over. as i mentioned, our back yard was uphill from theirs, and part way through the race it really started bucketing down. dad didn't show any outward anger, but he went into town, came back with a few bottles of dishwashing liquid, and coated the whole lawn in the stuff. come evening some of the guys needed to move their cars and when they got to the downhill slope to go out our driveway found they couldn't steer or brake. two made it out without much damage, but the third slid sideways, got onto the steeper part of the lawn and went straight through the fence and into one of the other students' cars and pushed it sideways into the house. total damage? four student cars with dents, one with busted front suspension, one wall of the student rental totalled, a bunch of arrogant students kicked out, and a few skidmarks on dad's lawn. total cost to my dad? four bucks in dishwashing liquid, a few weeks lawn regrowth and a brand new fence shared with the new neighbours, who were pretty decent people. dad's response to the police asking about the frothy shit on the lawn? "white oil. kills bugs" **tl;dr: arrogant neighbours kept parking on my dad's lawn, so one day when a whole lot of them were parked on the hill he lubed up the lawn and they went everywhere. damage caused neighbours to be kicked out, problem solved, revenge gained.**so full disclosure, i was reminded of this incident by this /r/pettyrevenge post, which you can find [here]( however, as a result of what happened due to the revenge, i felt that it was worth posting in /r/prorevenge. not trying to one-up /u/sammiesam123988, but him/her reminded me of this story that i had to share with you guys. if you want more, i recommend checking out that story as well as it's definitely a good read. **warning: great wall of text is below** anyways, this is a story that made it's way around my graduate school last year (i was in a related program, but not this specific one). masters of public policy (mpp) students in my school are required to complete what is called a practicum, a year long research project where you work with an actual government agency/policy institute. the practicum is supposed to be a project where you demonstrate everything you have learned over the two year program and many students rely on it as an example of the research they are able to produce for job applications once they graduate. it's an important part of the program, and if you don't complete the practicum you don't graduate **(foreshadowing!)**. needless to say, it is an extremely stressful project for the mpp's and most students take it very seriously. of course, you get lazy assholes even in very high ranking graduate programs (to put it in some context, this program is one of the top 10 in the entire country and arguably the best of it's kind on the west coast). this is a story of one of those assholes getting the ultimate karmic beatdown. there were three members of this infamous group, two of which (pat and ryan) were very well known in the program as being very intelligent and driven students. however, kiran, the third member, was the complete opposite. he was an indian kid that came from a very rich family, possibly book smart but nobody knew for sure because he was incredibly lazy and completed stoned 100% of the time, even in classes. now don't get me wrong, i also have a healthy appreciation for weed but smoking right before class in such a competitive graduate program is pretty disrespectful to the professor and your classmates. he also got in serious trouble his first year for sexually harassing multiple female international students, targeting them specifically to take advantage of their lack of fluency in english and lack of understanding of how seriously american universities take these types of offenses. luckily, these ladies still saw through his creepy bullshit and reported him to the school's administration. since the program is very expensive and only lasts two years, the school let him off with a final warning. one more violation of the student conduct code would result in his immediate dismissal from the program. needless to say, at the start of the 2nd year of the program nobody wanted to be in his practicum group. not a single person. perhaps in order to give him a fighting chance, the professor assigned kiran to pat and ryan's group because those two were known to be star pupils. they were also the only group that was made up of only males, so he wouldn't have the desire to sexually harass them in the intimate research setting that they would be working in for the year. naturally, kiran did none of work on the practicum, barely attending any of the group research sessions and was completely high whenever he decided to give pat and ryan the pleasure of his company. this went on for the remainder of the academic year. now pat and ryan were known to be pretty friendly guys, but they did not take any bullshit from anyone. they confronted him multiple times about his lack of contribution to the practicum but nothing ever changed. at this point, they could have just reported him to the professor, who would have removed him from the group and given him the chance to complete the practicum on his own. but pat and ryan had a much more devious plan in mind. after the 5th or 6th argument with him, they just gave up on trying to get him to work on the project. however, they kept him informed about the project's progress, emailing him about when they were meeting for group research sessions and what his share of the work would be. as expected, kiran's behavior didn't change. on the last day of class, groups were expected to turn in the written practicum report and present their findings to the entire class. pat and ryan submitted their report without kiran's name attached to the report and started their presentation with an announcement that since he hadn't contributed anything to the research, kiran did not deserve to receive any credit for the work. apparently kiran was in the middle of walking to the front of the class to try and fake his way through the presentation when this announcement was made. he stopped mid-step, his jaw dropped and then silently returned to his seat once the professor gave pat and ryan permission to continue the presentation without him. **the aftermath** kiran, pat and ryan were summoned to the dean's office so he could hear both sides of the story. in an act of desperation, kiran tried to place the blame on pat and ryan. he accused them of lying, claiming they never told him when the group work was taking place, they excluded him from participating in the research, they were discriminating against him because he was indian, etc. etc. he tried every slimy excuse he could come up with in a sad attempt to save his academic career. now remember, pat and ryan had documented their attempts to get kiran to do his fair share of the work on the project and were able to produce digital and print copies of the emails as evidence. one look at the emails and the dean immediately took pat and ryan's side. kiran would not receive any credit for the practicum project, and since he didn't even bother showing up to class half the time he didn't even have class participation points to bump his f up to a d, which may or may not have earned him a passing grade. but that's not even the best part: the dean, in his infinite wisdom and mercy, decided to give kiran the opportunity to come back the following year. he would be allowed to retake the practicum class again, and if he completed his project he would be allowed to graduate with his degree. now i don't know exactly how rich kiran's family was, but after paying over $100,000 in tuition over two years, his family was not going to shell out another $50,000 dollars for him to come back for a completely unnecessary third year in the program. he wasted 2 years of his life, $100,000 of his family's money and had nothing to show for it (no degree, no professors that would be willing to write him any sort of professional reference, no network of classmates that would be willing to help him out in any way at all), all because he wasn't willing to put in the work to pass one final course. i've gone to a number of alumni meetups since graduation, and i can confirm kiran was never seen or heard from again. tl;dr: do your fucking part in group work, especially in graduate schoolso i used to work as a delivery driver for a furniture retailer, and it was actually a pretty okay job (if you like heavy lifting, of course). except for my manager, brownnoser. now, brownnoser (bn for short) was about 19, not all that bright, and got to his position as warehouse manager by kissing massive amounts of ass. i was a few months older than him, and had been there for a year or so. maybe a bit less. but point is, i was one of the more senior guys on the delivery staff. so, one fine day, my truck went out, did it's deliveries, and was back by about 1pm (we started at 8, and usually went to 4-5, for reference.) i was looking forward to going home a bit early, but bn had different plans for me. what's important to remember in what follows is that bn was a salaried worker, and i had an hourly wage. i finish loading up my truck for the next day, and am just walking to the punch clock to punch out for the day, when i hear his nasally voice. bn: hey, bedfellow, hold on a sec. me: what is it, bn? bn: i need you to go out and wash your truck. it's dirty, and that doesn't reflect well on the company. me: youbestbejoking.png bn: come on, chop chop. i'm not paying you to stand around. me: you don't pay me shit. (i had no respect for this guy, and he and i both knew it. but, i got shit done, so the higher-ups weren't about to get rid of me.) bn: yeah, well, that can change if you don't do what i say. here's what you'll need to wash it. the pressure washer is outside. *bn hands me things like company-made bottles of glass cleaner, leather polish (for the dashboard), industrial soap, you know, basic truck cleaning stuff)* me: whoah, whoah, hey now. i've never used this stuff before, and i've seen these [whmis]( symbols before. i'm going to need to have a look at the [msds]( sheets for all of these supplies. bn: dude, no. it's glass cleaner and soap. it's in literally every household. just go do what i tell you. me: no. i have the right to refuse unsafe work and until i fully understand the hazards that these materials present, and have all the necessary ppe (personal protective equipment) i don't feel safe using these products. bn: stop being dumb. just go do it. me: this is in direct violation of occupational health &amp; safety guidelines, and if forced to proceed, i will be lodging a formal complaint both with oh&amp;s, as well as bigbossman. at this point, bn knows he is defeated. but i'm still just warming up. bn: fine. the sheets are this way. he takes me to the room with the msds sheets, where i spend the next 15 minutes perusing the sheets, asking inane questions just to make sure he doesn't leave. remember, i'm getting paid by the hour. he isn't. me: well, these supplies have the potential to cause skin and eye irritation, and this other cleaner needs to be used in a well-ventilated area. i'm going to require ppe to protect against these hazards. cue half an hour of bn and i rooting around the warehouse looking for rubber gloves that came past my elbows, a thick rubber apron, rubber boots, a plastic face shield, safety goggles, and a respirator. pretty much [this]( stuff, but it wasn't all in one convenient location like this. i don all the safety gear. bn is visibly agitated. bn: you look like an idiot. i hope you know that. me: i look like a *safe* idiot. i'm alright with that. bn: alright, now will you go wash the truck? me: i've never used the pressure washer before. i'm going to need to be fully trained on that before i operate it. bn: there's an on button, three power settings, and a trigger. a 4 year old could work it. me: i don't feel safe using it until i've been properly trained in it's operation. i could hurt myself. if looks could kill, i would be dead. but luckily i am protected from his acid gaze by my ppe. seriously, i'm fucking immortal under all this shit. we head out to the pressure washer, and i make him go over everything in excruciating detail. again, i question everything. "if there's a kink in the hose, could the machine rupture? what if it ruptures? this is a gas-powered washer. what if gas spills? i'll need a fire extinguisher..." this takes almost 20 minutes. we also have to go find the aforementioned fire extinguisher. at this point, we're about an hour and fifteen minutes into this, and i haven't even started washing the truck. me: oh hey, bn. before you go, you'll need to show me how ot use all these chemical cleaners. i read the msds sheets, but i still don't know how to properly use them. bn pretty much washes half the interior of the truck (no ppe of course) with me asking ever more questions. me: alright. i think i feel ready to do this now. bn: finally. asshole. me: i take my safety seriously, and you should too. bn storms off, muttering under his breath. i proceed to take 10 minutes wiping down the truck, and another 5 rinsing it clean. i go into bn's office. me: alright, i'm done. bn: that was fast. me: it was a pretty easy job. here's all the ppe back. thanks for being understanding concerning my safety. i drop the ppe in a pile on his carpeted floor. it was covered in the mud from the exterior of the truck. me: i think i'm going to take off now. have a good night, bn! he didn't reply. he just looked like he wanted to cry. i left a little after 3pm that day, having wasted almost 2 hours of bn's time. i found out the next day that he didn't leave til 7 that night. i was never asked to wash the trucks again. tl;dr: i take my safety seriously. even more so when i'm getting paid by the hour and my cunt hair of a boss is salaried.[previous post link]( thank you guys for all your support. just wanted to tell you how everything went over. about 20-something days later, i can tell you that deliverance has come to my classroom. i took a few of your suggestions (namely the anon emails and the ballot box), and i got a confession. maybe that's because i offered to cut the test in half for the innocent, give 75 questions to the confessors, and 150 to those who were found out but didn't confess. i couldn't match the anon confessor's handwriting to anything, but then they mentioned 4 more that joined in. the math teacher around the corner had more bullocks than little young fizzfox. the moment she caught whiff of my issue, she came into my classes and gave them militant, motherly talking-to. she came back and told me that one burst out into tears and ratted on the other four. three of them were in my lunch class, and one of them was in her lunch class. according to one of my students, hers had the idea to wreck the place when he heard that my sub handed a student the key to lock the door for lunch. apparently, he wanted revenge on me since i'm usually put on detention duty on wednesdays and he's always tardy to his classes on wednesdays (saith the roster). no phones in detention, which is school policy. i really don't care about that silly rule, but i want to keep my job. he had the nerve to make a phone call in my face without even asking my permission. as soon as he finished the call, i politely asked him to put it away. he didn't and went to playing fruit ninja (kids still play that game? hmm...). so i told him to wipe down my board and straighten a few books while i practiced a score for a coming concert. enough about him, my blood's boiling a little. his mom scares me. turns out this kid put tape over the security camera and went to work with the others. no audio, but they ran out of the room grinning. to sum up, i'm almost a happy musician again. that kid has a 200 question exam in math. i was offered to pick the questions, but i declined. his mother offered to pay for the piano though. i don't believe in denying a kid that wants to learn music, but if he ever wants to be my student, &lt;insert vulgarity here&gt;. my room's back in order, class is great once more, and we're having an end of the year concert to top it all off. to atone, those scoundrels--i mean students agreed to pass out flyers the week before, get t-shirts, and hand out tickets at the door. and clean up duty. thanks kids. don't shoot yourselves in your feet again. :-) edit: before you call my relief/previous mood rash, i did tell my other students that i was sorry. and they apologized as well since they were marked guilty when that kid told him he did it. he threatened to do something to mr. fizzfox if they snitched. expulsion was at the top of the list, but his mother argued it down to a two-weeks suspension. damn that woman! i see a bullet-proof vest in my future... and the sub. i still didn't get any luck contacting them, whoever they were. kids told me their name, and the principal told me that the sub wasn't allowed back. i'm thankful.13 or so years ago i was involved in a singles internet community forum (pre myspace/facebook days) that was centered around my local area. here i met up with this gal i'll call psycho mary sue (pms) who started taking an interest in me and in replying to a lot of my posts. we hit it off online and soon my online friends in the community began notifying me that she was asking questions and inquiring more about who i was and what i did. this was all during a time when cyber stalkers and internet related crimes to persons were all in the news. it didn't bother me that she was checking up to see if i was legit, it just told me she was interested and wanted to know more. we started dating but found out she really wasn't the *bring-home-to-parents* type material and overall we didn't have much in common. pms was rather crude with language, smoked the nastiest cigarettes i've ever smelt and had questionable illegal drug habit(s) i wasn't into. the kicker to this winner was that one of the words on her arm tattoo was misspelled (important later). she was really into me but from the start and wanted a friends w benefits relationship when i said i wasn't interested any further. hold the phone!! just sex only? sounds too good to be true right? my hormone's were in full gear but i was in my right mind to have pms get checked. doc's gave her the clean bill of health, free of std's and the like so everything seemed to be good to go. our first few weeks were hot and heavy. i started to sense that things were amiss when she became more and more possessive. checking my phone and email accounts, calling at odd hours and while i was at work. back then, my ego was about as large as my bank accounts so rather than ending it like i should have, i continued thinking i could control her. what i did next was a dick move, i know, but i asked her for a private xxx picture session in ~~s~~exchange for gifts . she didn't even bat an eye and made it clear it would cost me in material goods for the favor. i got my explicit photo session with pms and our normal hot and kinky relation continued for a few more months. around this time, i noticed funny things were happening around my place like my desk drawers appeared rifled through my financial letters/bills just disappeared before i got it. the sex was still fun but a nagging feeling kept gnawing at the back of my mind to end it. i got the first real redflag when i got a phonecall at work from my bank that someone tried to use my credit-card at a local department store. the female culprit with tattoos fled the scene but that's all the proof i had that it was her. i confronted her with no position to judge but she denied everything. suspicious of her actions, i started seeing her less and less of her over the few weeks and through disinterest and mistrust, i then called it off. the shit hit the fan once i did and i quickly found out that back at the start of the relationship, she wasn't just checking up on me, she was gathering a portfolio on me. she was a golddigger con-artist researching her latest claim. i made good money, had a great job and she felt that it was hers now. even though i had bought her things during our relationship, other small items in my place of minimal value started disappearing. not only that, she had no shame in attempting to blackmail me by calling my friends/family and even my job. pms made it clear that she would pretty much continue this until i gave her $2000 from what i "owed" her in taking and keeping the pictures. i had "destroyed her name" (hah!) by doing so. she underestimated me and my influence with job/family and friends. i was able to persuade them all to ignore her and i filed a restraining order within a few days. pms made several attempted to make good on threats. after she got the summons, pms all but dropped out-of-sight after a week or so. several months later, my place was broken into and my computer, tv, personal records and some sentimental items of little value were stolen. the police couldn't find any prints but clearly knew that the thief must've been familiar with me. they grabbed everything of value while disturbing next to nothing that normal burglars go for. aka drawers, filing cabinets, certain desk drawers, etc. that same day, pms attempted to purchase/withdraw money from another department store using a spare atm i kept hidden that she obviously found while raiding my place. my pin was easy to figure out and i found out via a fraud alert phone call that this card was being used for the first time. opps on her and lucky me! she had stolen my computer so she thought all the photos of her were in her possession. she forgot to take the backups i had in cd's right next to it. i gave the police all the sexually explicit digital photos in hopes that the department store surveillance would identify her. the female was wearing a hat and glasses and no other positive means of identification except for an exposed arm/wrist. the cops found the misspelled tattoo via her arm the video and were able to positively identify her in the act of fraud. i don't remember how long it took (felt like months) but pms was eventually arrested and convicted because of the photos i gave to the cops. i was told by the arresting officer who also handled my burglary that the prosecutor used post-it notes to cover up her naughty bits in full poster sized versions of the photos i took that identified her. lol! i never got back my computer (officer says she probably trashed it as it wasn't worth much) and some of my personal sentimental items she wanted to use for blackmail but the revenge was mine. *edited some text* i got a call from a guy with a heavy african accent. he was *demanding* my immediate attention to this matter. he said if he didn't hear back from my lawyer or me within a certain timeframe that he wished me luck. i did a little bit of internet sleuthing and realized this was a conman. i called back several times just harassing, and he was getting very fed up with dealing with me. he hung up on me several times and kept telling me to call him at 9am when the office opened back up. i placed a nice craigslist ad up, and his phone was probably ringing off the hook all night. "car siting on 20's. suede leather seats. wooded grain steering wheels. marble blues motor knocking, and transmission starting slipping. 350 big blocks, what you see is what you get. i sleep during the days but worked at night, so calling after 10pm is best. ***-***-**** calls only please, no texts. ask for kevin $750 cash firm, nothing less no room for nego. got more in the rims/tires " hope he enjoys his phone ringing nonstop. update: i called today and inquired about the chevy caprice for sale. the guy initially answered the phone "black &amp; associates lawfirm". i said something along the lines of "i'm sorry... i must have the wrong number. i was calling about the car for sale....???" he pauses momentarily and says "yes, it is still for sale. you should make out a check for $500 and mail it to ...some address in miami... after that, we will contact you back and drop off the car." my friend and i just looked at each other.... these guys are hardcore about scamming some people. i kept him on the phone as long as i could asking questions about the car. "how long have you owned the car.... it's blue right? what kind of leather does it have... etc. etc." i probably wasted 10 minutes of his life before he hung up on me. i felt bad after posting that ad, so i took it down. the last thing i wanted to do was help them. i moved the ad over the the casual encounters. i'm going to do some more digging tomorrow, and actually write down the address. then i'm going to call the miami police department and speak to someone in the fraud department. [here is what the add originally looked like.]( p.s. i know you're not supposed to give out personal information on reddit.... if i broke the rules, i'll remove the screen shot. in this instance though.... i think it is probably best if people have that information since it isn't just one person... it is many. i've heard that # being answered as a collections agency, lawyers office, and now some sort of car auction house... it all depends on who you get when you call in. update 2: called miami pd, they don't give two flying fucks about it... i keep getting placed in the call queue and eventually end up at a voicemail box. i cannot speak with someone live. i'm calling from a throwaway phone number, so i'd rather not give them my real information. last &amp; final edit: called the ftc fraud division or some shit... 877-382-4357, filed a complaint. not much more than i can do. the address where they're telling me to send money is 201 s. biscayne blvd. miami, fl. the phone number is 305-507-4429 if you didn't notice it in the ad. have fun with it. if we're wasting their time, they have less time to prey on the vulnerable. **tl;dr someone tried to scam me. i played along, and started to call them back just making up bullshit. no matter what, they played along with it. found out this was a serious crime ring, and reported it to ftc. hope there is a way to eventually shut it down so vulnerable people don't get duped by them.**if this isn't the right sub for this, please, let me know and i'll remove it (or, ya know, a mod will remove it but in that case i'd like to be notified as to what i did wrong &lt;3). with that out of the way... let me get on to the revenge. a bit of back story is in order here. the guy that this story is about will be called sd, short for stupid douche, and is just as his moniker describes. he's stupid, and a douche. he was in my physics class, which is how i knew him, and he was constantly pestering the professor with pseudo-scientific asides, plain incorrect information, and was generally an annoyance to the whole class. sometimes, when he spoke, i thought of jamming my pens in my ears. a story to highlight his idiocy: one time about two months ago he *walked up to the board* to correct some of our professor's math (which didn't need correcting), because apparently one part of an equation has to be on the left side of the equals sign, because otherwise it's wrong. if you've passed the first grade, you understand his error, and would likely have groaned a collective groan with the rest of the class. mind you, we were working with ohm's law, so it's not like it was particularly difficult math, either. basic algebra at most complex. now, fast forward to today. sd comes into the classroom (for the first time in a month or so), visibly agitated, and begins being his loud and obnoxious self. later, someone notices that he's working with a screwdriver (because he'd been particularly quiet), and sees that he's working with a *paintball gun*. on the lab bench. in the middle of class. a friend of mine (f1) confronts him about it. they get into a spat, and f1 leaves with a "fuck it, i'm tired of your shit." later, he's getting more talkative. the professor has told him to be quiet no fewer than fifteen times in the last five minutes. eventually, he gets so loud and obnoxious that the professor kicks him out. to quote my professor, to the best of my ability: "get out. get out. yes, i'm kicking you out. i haven't done that in seventeen years, but i'm kicking you out. get out of my classroom. you're worse than the sunday school that i teach. just get out. this is way overdue, and you're lucky i haven't called the dean." all the while, sd is talking back to the professor, and as the professor gets sd halfway through the door and turns back to go back to the board, sd takes the paintball gun and muzzle sweeps everyone in the classroom, as if he were spraying an assault rifle from the hip. i was livid, and about a half a strand of self control away from, "entschuldigung, herr professor (professor is german), but i'm gonna kick this clown's ass." fortunately, i had the foresight to realize that i'd get in trouble, too. after class, i headed straight to the vice chancellor's office, a group of four people from the class in tow. forty five minutes later, i see sd dragged away in handcuffs. i'm looking forward to a quiet class next week. tl;dr: ho brah, wan' scrap?when i was in my early 20's i was a single mom and i lived with my mom. i was no mooch. i split the rent and bills with her, etc. it was the best financial situation for both of us. we lived in a large house that had been converted into four apartments and tho many neighbors came and went, we stayed. one neighbor we had was a girl my age who i had known from school. she was also a single mom, but her mother had custody of her child and he only visited on weekends. i didn't especially like her. she was shallow and very sketchy, but since i was the only person she knew in the neighborhood she kinda pushed herself on me. ok. i knew how to watch my back around that kinda person. no biggie. one day she calls me to tell me she's going to move out but not tell the landlord. she was gonna leave her stuff (mostly rent-a-center stuff she hadnt paid for in months) there for a few weeks and asked if i'd call her cell and let her know if any packages came for her, etc. she had just broken up with this guy and he had been stalking her so she wanted to move w/o him knowing where. i said ok. that night she comes to my apartment to ask for some cd's if borrowed and when i went to get them a $100 bill of my moms (for food shopping the next day) went missing from the kitchen table, but i didn't notice until she was long gone. i knew it was her. no one else had been there and my mother and i tore the place apart looking for it. what use was calling the cops? she'd probably already spent it on ecstasy and weed. no point. but no one fucks with my mother. no one. my mom was in years cuz we were a paycheck to paycheck household and our cupboards were pretty thin. now this bitch was always locking herself outta her apartment and on numerous occasions i had climbed thru her living room window to open the door for her. so i waited till the following day and did just that. it was a nice, quiet neighborhood and no one batted an eye. i'd lived there longer then anyone and they'd seen me do this before. once i'm in there i took a box cutter to all her rent-a-center furniture (i unlocked the door and called them to come get the stuff that night). then i bagged up all the clothes she'd left behind. she liked to shoplift s there were pricy items with the tags still on them all over her room. purses and shoes too. i made trip after trip bringing this stuff up to my apartment. i left her sons room alone, no need for him to pay for his mothers sins. i cleaned all the food she left outta the cubbards and pulled the plug on the fridge and left the door open. i took cleaning supplies from under her sink and dumped them all over her expensive feather down comforter and mattress. she loved buying in bulk so i took all her bulk toiletries (soap, shampoo, lotion, tp, paper towels). i cleaned this bitch out! and what i didn't take i trashed. she had also left her cat there to fend for himself! (she ended up not returning for 2 weeks so she fully planned on letting it die a slow and painful death) i called the spca and had them pick him up as a stray, so don't worry. i put the word out i was selling some designer gear and in one day i made $400 (rock bottom prices!). i gave my mom $300 of it. just note: my mom did not approve of how i handled the situation but she also felt the bitch had it coming. 3 packages turned up for her while she was gone. all of them were expensive make-up and perfume. obviously i kept it. when she returned 2 weeks later with a u-haul trailer to get her stuff i reveled hearing her screams to find the furniture gone and a huge bill from rent-a-center on her door. there was next to nothing left to take except the items from her sons room and a few this and that's i had thrown aside. she didn't even come up to ask about any deliveries. as she brought the last bag of stuff out to the u-haul i opened my window and called out "hey! sandra! i was wondering if you got a hundred i could borrow?!". she shot me this look i can't describe! horror, rage...sooooo funny! i even went out to wave her off as she drove away :)my leadman's little pickup got filled with packing peanuts as a joke. he's a car nut and has a chevy ss pickup with enough mods to prove it, and the offender was moving away the next day, so he thought he'd get away with the crime. as revenge to the offender, the leadman torched out of steel a 2 foot long penis with balls and made it to attach to the hitch receiver on the offender's pickup. then, he put a bolt through the hitch and welded the bolt nut on. the offender drove 1,000 miles like that to his new home and job.when it comes down to it: if i feel i have been genuinely wronged, i want to destroy as much of your life as i can. i had a coworker/roommate who once stole from me. $250 all said, and it was to pay my cable bill for a few months, which he didn't which ruined mine and my other roommates credit. he worked for the same company as me so i put a keystroke logger on his computer, got to his incoming emails for orders before he did and deleted them. he was fired after about 8 months of that. the one i'm reddit famous for though... i made a girl fat... and not by marrying her. in 2003, my office got a new secretary and a new manager. the secretary, a thin blonde, was a vile she-devil, she wouldn't do anything the staff asked (find info, set up calls, get coffee for anyone who wasn't herself) and the manager wouldn't do anything about it. we joked that her job title was "internet quality control" because she more-or-less sent personal email and played on myspace all day, to which when she overheard, literally went to the manager in tears. then one day i got a rather large jar of candy as a gift and she just about single-handedly consumed half of it, which pissed me off good, i mean c'mon - ask. then later that week, i brought in a dozen donuts and she ate half of them on her own. upon putting the facts together, our web designer, editor and i decided to fuel the fire in something we called "operation: butter-up", where we each in turn brought in a large bag of candy to fill up my jar as fast as she could empty it. in the course of three months, she put on 20 pounds. in a years time, she unrecognizable and along with being a crank, she suddenly complained about a "thyroid problem". several times a week we provided her sweets and snacks of every kinds until her boyfriend dumped her, which was about eight months into the project, and she had to get a new wardrobe. we lucked out because she was rather oblivious, but we had more diabolical measures lined up if she stopped eating the candy, along the lines of mixing in weight-gainer to the non-dairy creamer she was using and things of that nature. that started in 2004 and she's still big to this day, saw her on facebook years back and smiled at our handiwork. still single to this day, and i would like to think that we had something to do with it.this is a long story, but hopefully my sweet, sweet revenge will give you a fraction of the satisfaction it did to me. *** a couple of years ago, i participated in a student exchange program in belgium and obviously i had to quickly find an appartement after my arrival. i was very lucky and found an incredible offer: a nice big loft with a roof garden, reasonably cheap and very close to my university. the only downside was that current occupier was not the official landlord: he had a long-term lease but was forbidden by contract to sublet the apartement himself. he was himself going on a student exchange program and had to quickly find someone to rent his apartmenet (which is how he explained the rent was so cheap).he seemed like a wealthy, trustworthy guy so i didn’t mind having an “off the books” deal with him. this ended up being my demise. when i moved in, the apartment was not in excellent condition. he basically left the apartment as anyone who leaves for a long trip would have: dishes stowed away and no laundry on the floor but otherwise not cleaned up. all the utilities were included in the rent, which was a big plus for me considering that it was january and electricity prices in belgium are pretty high. the central heating was broken, but the landlord was “kind enough” to buy me two small electric heaters that i could use in the living room and in my bedroom. strangely enough, my landlord had some kind of defect / disease which stopped him from having a sense of smell (he warned me his girlfriend would be able to smell if i had smoked in the apartment). i never smoked in the apartment (although i am a big smoker) because the landlord told me he was very opposed to smoking. as is customary in many european countries, he had asked for a deposit of around 1600 euros (2 months’ rent) to be paid back in full on the condition that there were no damages. although not in a written contract, i still give him the deposit because he left all his appliances (including cd / dvd collection and speakers, furniture, television, consoles, etc.) which i considered to be collateral. as months went by, i paid my rent to his mother (still in belgium) on time, had a great time and did no damage to the apartment. i had a minimal but courteous email relationship to the landlord, which never complained about anything i might have done. the landlord came back a couple of days before i was preparing to move out. he came to visit the apartment and check for damages and i was expecting him to hand me a brown envelope with the 1600 euros he owed me after he had noticed there were no damages whatsoever. when he entered he had a clearly fake and exaggerated disgusted look on his face. he explained that the appartement was dirty and that i needed to clean it before i received the money (which was not part of our verbal agreement). mind you, i had cleaned the appartement entirely to the best of my capabilities and to an extent any landlord would have found more than reasonable. he proceeded to show me all the wall stains (almost all of them already there), dust under the oven (yes, under the oven), rust on some pipes under the sink, etc. basically, he wanted me to clean the apartement as if he was about to sell it and, remember, the apartment was definitely not cleaned when i moved in. he offered to pay and go get some cleaning products for me, which he would bring back shortly. i assumed he would also help me clean with his girlfriend, but nope. he came back and basically ordered my girlfriend and i around like maids while he and his girlfriend were doing nothing. this was, still to date, the most humiliating frustrating experience of my life. i knew that i had to obey his commands because i would never get my 1600 euros back if i didn’t. i probably could have legally challenged him somehow but i was leaving the country a few days later and i preferred to swallow my pride and move on with my life. scumbag landlord, after 2-3 hours, seemed pleased with my work and instructed me to meet him at a café the next day to hand over the cash. i arrived at the meeting early the next day, hungover as hell, ready to get my cash and get the hell out of belgium (my flight was the next day). he did not have the cash with him. after i left the day before, he had called the utility company and realised that he had an outstanding statement of around 2000 euros. apparently those little electric heaters consumed energy like motherfuckers. i could / should have anticipated this, but as the utilities were “included” and i had never through of checking the evolution of my electricity consumption on the meter (which i had to unscrew a plank of wood to access anyways). scumbag landlord, after having made me clean his apartment like a little bitch, was asking for the 400 euros i owed him. he himself had always paid the utilites from the central (gas) heating and did not anticipate a rise in electricy bills after giving me the two electric heaters. that son of a bitch was even threatening to show up at the airport the next day and stop me from leaving if i didn’t! after myself calling the utility company, we went together to their offices and realised the balance was actually something around 1400 euros (not the landlord’s mistake). i only received 200 euros in return. i had never been so furious in my life and could barely stop shaking for the next hours. i wanted so much to get revenge, but i only had one night left in the apartment. i was also legitimately scared that he would show up at the airport (i should mention that he was a big guy and a muay thai fighter). i had to somehow delay the effects of the revenge so that they would be only notibeable after i was gone. this excluded the obvious damages to the property, which was my initial idea. that’s when all the pieces fit together in my mind and my evil plot was hatched. after sharing the idea with my girlfriend, we went to the nearest fish store and bought something like 10 euros worth of fish leftovers usually purchased to make fish stock or soup (my best estimate is something like 2-3 kilos of fish bones, etc). for the next couple of hours, i blended the fish with a lot of water, cived out the chuncks, and filled up spray bottles with a murky but very liquid fish mixture. i sprayed that fishy water everywhere, but i really mean everywhere. under the over, behind the furniture, on the floor, the walls, the ceiling, between the drawers of his desk, under his mattress and even on the clothing he had originally left in storage when i moved in. there is no way he could smell the fish, and he probably would not have received complaints from the neighbours until they were rotten and stinking out the whole building. to this day, i do not know how my fishy revenge turned out. i can only imagine that his friends told him he smelled like shit and/or that his apartment smelled of rotting sea creatures, by which time it would have been too late to reverse anyways. it probably cost him a shitload of money to professionally clean his house and i sincerely hope he is still paranoid about smelling like fish but nobody wants to admit it to him. tldr: scumbag landlord took advantage of me and did not give me back my deposit. knowing he has no sense of smell, i took revenge by spraying fishy water all over the apartment which he probably realised way after it smelled of rotten fish. as the title implies, this is not my prorevenge. a friend of mine recently bought a house. his hobby is pouring silly amounts of money into marginally-awesome, beat ass old cars, and right now he's got a well-used ~~alpha~~ alfa romeo 75 on blocks in his driveway. thus, he parks his daily driver on the street. there is plenty of parking on the street, as nearly everyone parks in the driveway, but every few days this woman with a playboy sticker on the windshield of her white 90's mustang parks right in front of his house before he gets home from work. one day, he pulls up behind her right as she's getting out of her car. he says, "excuse me ma'am. i was wondering if you would mind not parking in front of my house. i like to park here." she responds with tons of attitude, "this isn't *your* parking spot. you don't own the street." he's annoyed at her being rude for no reason, but wanting to get his way, he keeps calm and says, "i know. it's just there's plenty of parking on this street. i'm asking you as a favor." "yeah? well i don't know you, and i'll park wherever i want. get rid of that pile of trash and park in your driveway if it's so important to you." to be fair, the ~~alpha~~ alfa does look like a pile of trash, but still this woman was pretty unbelievable. thing is, my friend works in private security, and has contacts in the local pd. he calls his buddy, and asks her to run the lady's plates, getting her address. then he waits. she continues to park in front of his house, but he doesn't make it home from work early enough to actually see her. a couple of weeks later though, the stars align, and he is out getting his mail when she pulls up. he walks over to her, and says, "excuse me. i just wanted to ask you again to park somewhere else. just 15 feet forward. i'd really appreciate it." "look asshole, i'm going to park here, because it's across the street from my friend's house. deal with it." (her friend is a skeezy douche who inherited a nice house from his dad, and proceeded to neglect it until it was the street eye-sore). "listen lady, this really isn't cool. it's not like i come to 123 example ln. and park in front of your house..." her eyes got really wide and she immediately got back in her car and moved it down the block. he hasn't had any trouble with her since. i had posted this earlier on under a different title in /r/pettyrevenge . however, i felt it was rather extreme for a pettyrevenge post, so i put it down here as well. anyways, after seeing [this post]( about how op got revenge on an obnoxious shit and his friends during halloween, i thought i'd post my halloween-related story on here as well. now, it's pretty long, so please bear with me. alternatively, feel free to skip right down to the revenge part. **background** in the area where i live, there's this community service centre, and during halloween, we get to volunteer to take part in haunted houses (haunted rooms would be more accurate, because there's multiple groups and we only get a large room to work our magic in) as staff members. the main visitors are around 7-15, meaning that our rooms have to be scary, but not too scary (the first year this happened, the workers ended up with a lot of crying kids on hand, so the years afterwards had limits on how scary it could be). well, back in 2013, there was this 17-18 year old shithead (we'll call him fuckass) who started coming. he kept on going into haunted houses and making really snide comments. the makeup looked obviously fake (what do you expect, we're not professionals, we're just a bunch of teenagers who want to bring the halloween spirit alive), none of it was scary, the actors were too young and even a room filled with fluffy pillows was scarier... those were just some of the remarks. we weren't happy, but we shrugged and let it slide, figuring he wouldn't be back. boy were we wrong. 2014 rolls over, and he comes back, ***pulling the same shit.*** what's more, when he got out of the attraction, he'd tell others what was in it and ruin the entire damn thing. come 2015, and i was team leader this year. my group mates were all dreading it, because we knew he'd probably come around and do it all over again. sure, i have a few skills i didn't show, but we can't have cards flying around and people popping out of nowhere constitute the entire house, can we? however, as a seasoned veteran, i've met quite a few people over the course of those four years. one of them was this guy who we'll call tommy, and he was a whiz at woodwork. for example, on my first year doing this (2011), we had this spot where there would be a 'vampire' rising from the grave, which called for an actual coffin. there's no way we're buying one, and he was the one who made it from thin boards of wood, a week before the entire thing started. **planning** now, tommy was also a devilishly clever person who did not appreciate his experience for the past two years being ruined. so, he flipped a switch, and changed from his usual polite gentleman mode to his bastard-coated bastard with extra bastard filling mode, and when i contacted him asking him to join my group, he accepted, proposing a plan. during the time between 2013 and 2015, he had taken his woodwork to a whole new level. forget the coffins, he could make a table with so many gimmicks and secrets that it would take an entire month to discover them. and he was going to do exactly that. in addition to tommy, i had also recruited a couple of other people who had been on the receiving end of fuckass' douchebaggery and wanted to get back at him. then, another group heard what we were doing and decided to join up with our team, meaning that we were given the largest room, which was at least four times larger than the other rooms. our now 30-something strong group put our heads together, and we plotted. coming up with scary sights, well beyond what we usually would do at the centre. there would be no fake mannequins in place of bodies, nor would there be any tissue paper doubling as scabs and wounds. we were determined to do the best we could and give this asshole his due. for the month leading up to halloween, we worked as hard as we could to get it all done. recording sounds, shopping, communicating over google docs... we worked our asses off on it, just to make sure we could deliver that karmic kick up his backside. finally, halloween rolled over. i met up with tommy and several others at the centre especially early, well before any of the other groups were even here. we spent the next three hours getting the place set up, and by cleverly draping up the black swathes of cloth we were provided with, we turned a large room partitioned by sliders into a labyrinthine, dark horror where we waited to give patrons the scare of their lives. after a quick lunch, the performers arrived, four of who were hefting a large table. needless to say, the table attracted quite a few stares. "holy shit... what the fuck is that?" "oh, just a surprise that we have in store for the sucker. " tommy gave the people asking his signature 'i'm about to wreck some serious shit' grin. as the hours rolled by, our justice squad labored like an army of ants. the makeup artists started working their magic, and slowly, horrific injuries bloomed on our actors. from gashes to scars, from flesh rotted away to reveal bones to mangled limbs and missing chunks of flesh, they either looked like they just came out of an accident, or could pass themselves off as the freshly reawakened dead, come back to haunt the living. (alright, i might have exaggerated a bit, but you get the idea.) meanwhile, back in the haunted room, we went and, having checked that it was partitioned like we wanted and all the decorations were here, started laying out everything needed. first, we divided the materials based on what went into which section. then, we all split apart and decorated the sections we were responsible for, before converging again at the table, which tommy had decorated while we weren't around. tommy turns to me, a smirk adorning his face. "lux, should we tell them about the table?" i nod, and tommy grins. "so guys, as you can see, there's several dishes, silverware and those fancy lids all laid out on the table, right?" cue a round of uncertain nods. tommy reaches over, lifts up one of the lids, and everyone is greeted with a head on a plate. eyes closed, shaven head, blood around the neck. then, the 'head' opens their eyes and lets out a shriek. pandemonium ensues. the rest of the team let out yells of alarm as the 'head', laughing, disappears from view. moments later, the 'head' (with the body attached) crawls out from under the table, before revealing that the 'plate' was not actually a plate, but was painted on the cloth itself. peering over reveals a hole in both the cloth and the table itself, with two slats near the bottom of the table. these slats were movable, so the actor portraying the 'head' could slide the slats apart, stick his head through the hole, then slide them back to complete the illusion. a little further along the table, there's a similar but smaller mechanism for someone else to do the same with their arm, and on top of that hole we plopped on a pile of fake arms, before drizzling them with a shit ton of fake blood to camouflage the arm. fast forward a couple hours, and it's now thirty minutes before game time. the actors have all sated their hunger, and have also run through the entire thing a couple of times. now, they're just chatting and mooching around. tommy and i are worried though. what if fuckass *doesn't* turn up and all our work was in vain? i sneak out and hide behind one of the numerous veils hung up in the hallway leading to the corridor with rooms, where the visitors are gathered. and from my vantage point, among our sea of faces, i spot a familiar one. jackpot! i run back as quickly and quietly as i can, telling tommy. tommy literally jumps up from his seat, and calls everyone together. he tells them to relieve themselves, put their stuff away and get their shit sorted out, because they're going to start business. five minutes before opening, everyone's getting into position and exchanging small talk. i myself am 'tying' one of the makeup artists to a railing (she volunteered to be one of the victims in a slaughterhouse scare zone) when we hear commotion outside. i go out to take a look, and see fuckass (as well as some of his scumbag friends) trash-talking the team leaders of one of the other haunted rooms. i step in and tell him to fuck off, and he responds by going 'yeah, i'm not scared of your stupid attraction. i saw how lame it was last year.' *let's see you say that after you get through it.* **revenge** the haunted rooms event last for two (three if there's a lot of people) hours, and during this time, we got several visitors. we gave them the normal version of the journey, where we don't pull off the really horrible tricks yet. those are reserved for a certain jerkwad. the journey also varies slightly with each one. we arranged the partitions so that we can have more than one potential route. for example, certain rooms are skipped out if there are young children (like the mad slaughterhouse), the order of rooms shown is mixed around, and sometimes the rooms are not seen, but heard. it's never really the same with our house. after around an hour of scaring, we get a little rest break. the lights are on, the windows on the door are covered with black pieces of paper, and we're all chilling. then, there is loud rapping on the door. i move one of the pieces aside, and see fuckass pounding on the door, his cohorts snickering as well. we were pissed. i mean, who the fuck does that? we decide, fuck it, if he won't treat us with respect, then we won't hold back on him either. the guy at the door tells them to be more patient and that they would 'get to go in as soon as they [us scarers] were ready'. they lay off the knocking, and we spend the rest of the break preparing for his arrival. the only thing fuckass and co. saw were one or two of us running out to the toilets and getting some water. finally, the trap was set. fuckass and his friends swagger in, completely unaware of what lay in wait for them like a suckerfish to bait. the first thing they noticed was the mist, drifting out of a cauldron. the actress (who is playing the role of a hideous old crone), is faced away from them, hunched over and muttering stuff. she turns to them, and tells them the story... with a twist. instead of the usual introduction to how they should make sure to obey the rules, she just says something about how they should be careful, for 'dark things, evil things, lurk ahead. enter at your risk..." fuckass and co. shrug, and walk on through the shroud of mist, formed by the co2 pouring from the buckets above. now this is where it starts to diverge from the normal path. remember my skills? because as soon as they clear the veil, the first thing they see are several cards coming at them at as high a speed as i could make them. of course, i aimed to miss - but barely, and so that it whooshes past their head. "what the hell was that?" cohort #1 asks. "oh, man up. i was right, this is still lame!" fuckass laughs. *but is that a slight silver of anxiety i hear in your voice?* well, they got through most of the attractions. i think they started to crack when they got to the mad slaughterhouse (there was fake blood and actual pig organs in there, as well as a couple of people playing victims), and from there on it only got worse and worse. by the time they get to the dining hall, they're starting to shake and sweat visibly. the butler (played by tommy) invites them to sit down and, ignoring their sounds of protest, shows them to their seats. then, he takes out a silver bell and rings it - and lo and behold, the fly-covered people with their heads resting in plates of rotting 'food' come alive! blinking dazedly, they look around, blank looks in their eyes. i think i saw one of the friends pale when a zombie stared them in the eye. tommy lifts open some of the covers on the dishes. roasted fingernails, bug salad drizzled with rainwater vinegar, boiled heart (yes it was a real pig's heart) earthworm pudding... tommy took great pleasure in describing each and every one of the dishes in graphic detail, taking pleasure in making the fucker squirm. then, after all that fuss, only one lid remains uncovered. at this, tommy puts on an air of excitement, rubbing his hands and muttering to himself how the last dish would give them 'the greatest surprise of their lives'. the zombies moan and groan, taking the cutlery and thumping on the desk with it. tommy slowly, agonizingly takes hold of the lid, and the thumps get more and more frantic. finally, in one swift movement, tommy yanks the cover away, and yells 'behold!' fuckass and his cohorts catch sight of a shaven, sheet white head, with blood around the neck. but only for a second, because the next second, the head has opened their eyes, and let out an unearthly shriek. *and unfortunately for fuckass, tommy sat him down so that when the 'head' comes alive, they are facing his seat, looking right into his eyes.* what ensued was possibly the most glorious moments of my life. fuckass and his friends let out loud screams of their own, and knock over their chairs in their haste to get out. however, a real arm snakes out from the pile of arms and swipes at them, making them scream even louder, the zombies moaning. tommy yells 'i hope you enjoyed your dinner!" as they run past. they're in the last room now. they're looking around, and they can't see the door (which is covered by a black curtain). i wait until they're looking in the wrong direction, then quietly draw back the curtain and hide. when they see it, they practically stumbled towards it. they're so focused on the door, they don't notice me sneaking out of my hiding spot and assuming a position near the door. "i hope you enjoyed your stay!" *mad cackling* i still remember the surprised yelps they let out when i made my audial debut. needless to say, after being on the receiving end of what we call 'the great scare of 2015', he never tried to stir up any trouble for the rest of the time he was here. **tl;dr** : when you are such an asshole that an entire haunted house redesigns and actually creates features specifically to terrify you, it might be time to re-evaluate your behavior. **edit** : changed tl;dr to the contents of /u/jintess's comment.so i work in a well known chicken restaurant chain in england, and on a monday and tuesday two guys with down's syndrome work during the day shift. i suppose to give them a bit of money and something to do. they are two of the nicest people i know, and have such happy, nice personalities and wish no harm on anybody. well earlier today these private school toff assholes strut in, giggling about something. a coworker of mine heard them doing down syndrome impressions and obviously did not give a flying fuck if anyone around them could hear them. so anyway they order their food and one of them orders an extra spicy burger. well we soaked the bread in extra hot sauce, grilled the tomato in extra hot and basically made a burger so hot, he's gonna be shitting fire for the next week. he didnt finish it, was all red and had tears coming down his face. we were all laughing as he left the restaurant full of shame. tl;dr guy laughed at someone with down's syndrome, i make his food too spicy for him to eat, leaves embarrassed with all his friends and the staff laughing at himfirst and foremost, let me emphasize that this story is entirely centered around my friend and his family. i had little-to-no involvement in this whatsoever. obviouisly, names have been changed. the story begins with my best friend otto winning 4 tickets on a cruise ship to cozumel, mexico. he first offered to me, but i was single at the time and to quote myself, "didn't want to waste a cruise ship not-fucking." so he reaches out to his sister, jane. jane is ecstatic and asks if her boyfriend, steve, can be invited in tow and otto gives the thumbs-up. so it's otto and his fiancee, claire, his sister jane and her boyfriend steve. again, this story was told to me and i'm repeating back to the best of my knowledge/ability. the cruise is about 8 days and for the first 3 everything is going swimmingly- there's plenty of drinks, plenty of dancing, karaoke, gourmet-ish food and entertainment, and there's plenty of time left before even reaching cozumel. everything's going well until the 3rd night when jane knocks on otto's door, crying and shaking. "she didn't look that bad since she wrecked her car that one time" otto told me the morning after. jane was reticent and very reluctant to give any details, but she had asked to sleep with otto and claire that night. she cited the reason being that she and steve had been fighting and didn't want to be in the same room as him. red flags were waved, but otto was pretty cool with steve at that point, so he waited to gather more details. the next day, claire and jane talked at length and jane finally admitting that apparently "fighting" translated into "rape". steve had forced her down while they were both tipsy and jane wanted to sleep it off. otto was pissed, but he was also fucking unbreakable. they were going into a foreign country and there were opportunities. however, it was established that jane would be sleeping with claire and otto would be rooming with steve. otto wasn't happy, but my buddy's fucking unbreakable- he looked the fucker in the eye and smiled knowing full well that steve would get his. steve, on the other hand, was told that jane just needed to "cool off" and that nothing was wrong- he's not naive, but he bought it. day 4 and they arrive in cozumel. as soon as they step off, otto and claire tell steve to give them all of his belongings. steve gets suspicious but is diffused when claire explains that "this place is loaded with pickpockets who know how to steal from tourists. we'll hang back." steve went off with jane, having conspired with otto and claire- he had only $200, which was quickly borrowed by jane, who asked sweetly if steve could lend it to her while she looked for a nice pair of shades. steve never saw the money again, nor has he seen jane as far as i know. his cell phone? it thrown into the gulf. his wallet's cards were cut up and tossed in the trash while his cash was used to buy lunch and some souvenirs. his id card, which would get him back into the ship? lost with his passport. in the gulf. i don't quite know the details about how a missing passenger is dealt with. otto didn't give me any details on the matter, but he did make it a point to tell me that steve didn't speak spanish and "he'll be there long enough for someone to go all "cartel" on his ass hopefully". while i suspect otto bribed the staff to count steve as present, i'd rather not implicate my best friend for something i don't know, nor do i want to. the rest of the trip was decent, but nothing like a cruise- jane was in bad shape the rest of the way and most of the time was spent with her, helping her calm down and talking her through her issues. there were drinks, some gambling in the casino and some really fun moments, but steve had left his mark and the return home was a welcomed sight. bonus: steve still hasn't been heard from, while jane's been seeing a grief counselor and making strides to move on from the trauma steve caused her. i got to be the best man at otto's wedding and claire is expecting her first child with otto in 6-7 months. **tl;dr-** best friend's sister gets raped, rapist is left stranded in a foreign country. once again, this submission is not my own encounter. names and locations have been changed for anonymity's sake. i'm retelling this story to the best of my knowledge and ability and apologize for any important details left out.so for those of you who read my last story, i figured i'd share this one because i had an update. i'll get to that after the story, though. alright, so my friend dave's little brother always had a gang around him which we tended to call "the fiends". there was a line in fear and loathing in las vegas where they're bumbling around, high on ether and the character says something like "you fiend!" when he's referring to the other character. it stuck, and became our little insulting name for the group of habitual drunk 16 year olds. we honestly used to sit around and watch them, because they were amusing. for this i am using the real nicknames we knew them for at the time. seriously, you'll see why i had to ad this disclaimer in a moment. anyway, there are 3 main players in this story. first we'll call rabbit, because it was his nickname (i have no idea why.) he was a sniveling little bastard, who was sure he was smarter than everyone else around him, in spite of great evidence to the contrary. next was a kid we knew as monk, (i have no idea why this was his nickname either,) was was generally a cool guy. always had a skateboard on hand (because 1990s), and was pretty well known as being almost impossible to anger... ok, maybe that was why we called him monk. next was monk's girlfriend, the head monster, (i know exactly why she had this nickname,) who was a pretty nice girl. yes, she did earn the nickname when she was single, but she was totally devoted to, and in love with monk. cute too, really. so, one day the fiends are all out getting something or other, probably cheap beer and pot that's like 40% lawn clippings, and it's just a few people at the house. dave and i are in his room, the head monster and rabbit are in the living room downstairs. dave and i decide to take a break from... probably goldeneye? something for the n64, i can't remember. upon walking down stairs, we look into the living room and see rabbit, laying on top of thm and trying to remove her pants. now, she appears to be unconscious at the time, so he wasn't really having any issues. when he sees us, he instantly gets up, and bolts out of the house as fast as he can. running is what this kid was best at, because getting his ass handed to him was the second best thing he was good at. we would have chased him down, but i've always been a fatass, and dave was checking to make sure thm was ok. she was out cold, and we (being stupid teens) reasoned it was better to zip up her clothing, and not tell her what happened. we figured it was better than waking a drunk and telling her, "hey, someone just tried to rape you," because once again, we was morons. we did however decide to tell monk, in case he wanted our help beating the shit out of rabbit. we told him what we saw, and he frowned slightly at the information. he only did that for a moment or two before smiling at us, and saying, "hey, don't worry about it. i can handle it," and then wandering off. cue ~~4 months~~ an amount of time later. it's safe to assume at this point rabbit somehow thought he had outsmarted us, or ran too fast to be seen, because he started showing up around the house again to hang out with dave's little brother. he acted like nothing had happened, and chatted like he wasn't a gigantic piece of shit. so one day we're sitting around with the fiends, watching something on the tv. rabbit is casually sitting on the edge of the coffee table talking shit about someone who wasn't there at the moment, and dave and i were just kind of wishing we could break his knees. . . . cue monk showing up, and things unfolding like this. monk: "hey dave, hey isst. good to see ya!" *walks directly over to rabbit* monk: "hi rabbit!" *picks up his skateboard, and smacks rabbit so hard in the teeth with the truck that blood splatter somehow ended up around a corner, in another room* monk: "sorry about the mess, dave. take care guys!" *turns and leaves the house without saying another word* . . . the best part of that, is that rabbit was such an asshole that no one in the room questioned why it was done. as soon as we heard the front door close, everyone in the room burst out laughing, while rabbit was on the floor crying. never saw the shit weasel again after that day. update for people that read the last story i posted. i actually found, and got into contact with dave! it literally boiled down to me searching through everyone on facebook with his name, and looking for the weird ass bands we both liked in his interests. he's doing well, family and all that, and is far, far away from that house. edit: shit, left out the my favorite part.this is a throw away account so i don’t link this story to my original account also sorry for the grammar because english isn’t my first language and i’m typing on my phone. a little backstory first: my dad was one of the first geologist to go and work in the gulf in that time dubai was just a desert so we a very well off family, my older brother have quadriplegia and can’t talk caused by complication during birth. every time we get back to our motherland we go back to rural town where my parents were born and raised and away from the city because traffic noises always made my brother jump and his muscles stiffen for few seconds if he heard a loud noise like car horn. it was summer vacation my dad went to the city to do something related to work there and mom left to visit a relative in the hospital so me and my older brother were left to the babysitter don’t know how old i was back then but i was still in elementary school. so the babysitter decided to put my brother in wheel chair and go for walk around the town and visit the park there while i decided to stay and play around in front of the house with a friend. the babysitter came early and red eyed because she was crying, apparently when she was taking my brother to the park some fat little fuck had some fireworks which made my brother jump and stiffens the kid noticed that and found it funny by throwing fireworks toward my brother and making him jump then calling him a retard. the babysitter told him to stop and tried to chase him only to run and come back again throwing fireworks in the end the fucker managed to throw plastic bottle and hit my brother head then my brother broke down crying. the babysitter managed to catch that little fat fuck but his mother who also massive fat fuck told her not to touch her kid, the babysitter told her that her son was bullying my disabled brother, the fat fuck said that she was to blame and she should keep that thing inside the house this was the moment where the babysitter started crying and took my brother home. after finishing telling me the story my brother cried not because of the bullying but because he felt he couldn't defend the baby sitter, i was kid back then and my heart sunk inside. now i mentioned that we were very well off and because my brother liked videogames so we had every console out there from atari to nintendo and sega system with ton of games and big crt tv and my brother loved to watch more than play so we always had kids come to our home to play with us one of them was our neighbor kid who was freshman in high school and very close to my brother so we going to call him “my brother from another mother” mbfam. so i went and told him the whole story and he was furious, he went and called some kids to gather information about this little prick, apparently one of his classmate knew he is sadistic fuck who liked to take puppies and put them in front of stray dogs (if you don’t know stray dogs will attack any dog who come near their territory). so one of the kids went to his house and told him that they found a dog and he should come and see it, the naïve little shit went straight to the trap where we send him to area where there is no houses and people around. me, mbfam and couple of kids get him surrounded mbfam said “ i heard you bullied my brother from another mother” and he pushed him the kid said in tearted up voice “stop”, mbfam said “you want me to stop now ? why are you gonna cry? did you stop when he cried” then another kid pushed him every time he wanted to get up a kid pushed him to the ground then one of the pushed into a puddle of mud then took off the fat kids shorts so to looks like he shat himself and all kids started laughing “dude why did you shit yourself” the fat kid started squealing and ran straight to his house. 30 mins later he got his mom banging the door and screaming like crazy mad screaming, the babysitter was scared shitless and couldn’t dare to open the door that until the sheriff came it must somebody called him because it was a freaking circus in front our house a fat bitch and her spawn and shit ton of kids i felt like all the kids of the town gathered in front our house. the sheriff came to see what the fuck is happening of course the fat whale started to scream incoherent word saying words like “this little twig…this thing…my poor baby” then the babysitter opened the door and told her side of the story how the kid started throwing fireworks and making my brother uncomfortable then the whale interrupted “then the bitch shouldn’t took that retarded outside the house”. in this moment the sheriff said “shut your fucking mouth! he isn’t retarded he is physically disabled and he smarter than you and your son so go back to your fucking home before i arrest you for domestic disturbance”. everybody could see the fear inside the whale eyes she took her spawn back with the cheers of kids all laughing around her. now the kid have been known of kid who shat himself. my parents came back home i don’t know what exactly happened but the father came to apologize and their house was getting vandalized every day for a week or something. years later i came back to our little town for relative funeral, i catched up with mbfam and he told me this: &gt;the father of the little kid was a truck driver who was never home. &gt;the kids was spoiled by his mother and even in high school he was a little shit. &gt;the father died so the kid go his inheritance, ransacked the the house stealing his mother jewelers or anything expensive in the house. &gt;his mom was left with little to no money so the community gathered some cash to help her. &gt;she refused to rent the house or sell it and move to small apartment. &gt;her house is complete dump with no electricity or running water. &gt;nobody know what happened to the kid. tried posting this in petty revenge but it got removed. i guess it might not be very petty since i mindfucked this guy haha. i run a youtube channel called ownage pranks. a viewer sent me the callback number to one of these indian scammers and asked me to prank them. i decided to call them as a fellow indian man pretending to fall for their scam, and see how they'd react. here's the [video.]( i had so much fun messing with this guys head, he gradually gets more and more raged until i get the guy to curse at me at hang up. if you guys get any calls like this and they give you a callback number (or any other obvious scam), please send it my way! it was extremely fun for me to mess with this guy's head and i definitely want to do it more often. got any suggestions for what types of scams i should try to expose next? :) a few years ago i was going through a series of shitty events regarding my girlfriend and her infidelity, turns out she had slept with one of my friends and also blew another one of the people i knew. a few days after finishing things she tells me about all the other times she had cheated, or at least all the times she remembers and even laughs about it to my face i'm with my friends drinking later that night when my ex texts me asking to have her bikini back that she left at my house ... lightbulb. we have my buddies girlfriend drive to pick up the bikini (and more beer) while we stay at the house. now the weather had been below freezing for the past couple of days so everything outside was frozen solid. our night progressed and eventually nature had to take it's course, this is when my revenge began. after half a night of hearty drinking my two friends and i had become quite full of urine so not wanting to waste such a golden resource we decided to save most of our piss that night in a one gallon ziplock bag. with the bikini inside the bag and the three of us peeing at regular intervals by the next morning we woke to find our vessel had become a solid frozen mass off different levels of urine, with a stark contrast between two of the "layers" it was a pretty nasty sight to behold. not only was the night with my friends cathartic but i felt a sort of pride in the piss bag, knowing that my ex would think i'm a fucking lunatic and hopefully won't try to contact me ever again. since i hadn't replied to the text my ex sent on day one, by day two she had sent me another to which i rather lazily responded a few hours later with "it's on your porch". i had been back at my house not ten minutes before i had a call from my ex in a seething tone "your mother will hear about this" which i thought was rather petty and funny since my mom wouldn't care since she didn't like or trust my ex to begin with. once off the phone with my ex, i get a call from my mom having he tell me all about how angry x was and how she didn't do anything to warrant tha. this should probably go to r/pettyrevenge but i felt like i piss is a little too gross...sometimes the easiest way to deal with an asshat is to get accountants and the government involved. it all started out normally enough. through some acquaintances, my so and i met a couple that'd just recently moved close to where we were living. we attended their house warming and spent a few other nights hanging out. it'd really be nothing to write home about if my so hadn't come to me asking me why the guy in this other couple messaged him letting him know that his girlfriend was convinced that i was trying to steal her boyfriend. if that sentence left you confused, i was too. the girlfriend didn't say a word to me, but spun some tale to her boyfriend who also didn't say anything to me, but started messaging my so this nonsense. the boyfriend... unattractive doesn't describe him, but it starts to come close. if he was the last man on earth, i'd become very familiar with my right hand. as you might imagine it's hard to definitely prove that you didn't do something and it wasn't just flirting that i apparently engaged in according to them. i was apparently running my mouth about all sorts of stuff and causing issues for them. i apparently told nameless others that he was cheating on her and that she was cheating on him and that she was only in it for the money and on and on. (i'm saying "nameless" because they were never produced. ...because it never happened. i'm convinced that it was something she made up.) it became a they said - she said with my so in the middle. redditors, i honestly didn't do any of the shit that i got accused of. it was all catching me totally off guard. i told them to piss off and broke all ties. two months later, i get a message asking me why i was sending snail mail letters to the boyfriend's mother implying that the girlfriend was a stripper and a whore. i didn't know the mother or the address and thought that the girlfriend was a dramawhore, but not a streetwalker. this time i'd really had enough. i didn't want them and their drama making regular reappearances in my life. a conversation that i'd overheard between the boyfriend and another guy popped into my head while i was seeing red. the boyfriend owned his own company and had been bragging about how he didn't pay his taxes and neither did his company. i know my way around the internet a little bit, so i started researching him and his company. i took screenshots of what i found which included two different instances of him confessing to the tax evasions on social media sites. (i read far too many comment threads and posts of his and discovered his presence on some eye raising sites in the process.) i took what i had and both mailed hard copies to a few local irs criminal investigator agents as well as emailed it to them. (after i was done looking up the boyfriend and his companies i started looking up the information of people in the local irs office who would be tasked with investigating him). i corresponded with one of the irs agents briefly and then there was a silent pause in which i'd considered it all going nowhere. and then i heard it through the grapevine... irs agents had shown up at his home. they had investigated him and his company. together he owed something close to $2 million in back taxes. (it'd been years since he'd paid both.) he ended up having to downsize his lifestyle a bit to start making the payments. i know he'd started hiding some of his assets by putting them in her name so i know that the girlfriend got dragged into the investigation too. i think that it all freaked his girlfriend out and stressed their relationship because she ended up leaving him shortly after it all started. i still honestly don't understand what the point of all of the accusations was. my so doesn't have any insights either. i know i probably should have directed more of my efforts towards the girlfriend, but he was the one who unknowingly and unintentionally gave me some nice ammunition to extract some revenge against the both of them. he's now working to pay what he owes and she's now living at home and working in retail. they don't talk. i haven't heard a peep from either one of them for the last almost 2 years, so i'm satisfied with how things ended. they don't know that it was me who give the irs much of what they needed.a long time ago (no, just 20 years ago), in a galaxy far, far away (no, just 5 streets over), i rented a nice, big flat in a nice old fixed-up house. house was foreclosed, but the stupid property management company that managed it for the bank did everything wrong. first of all, it didn’t notify me of the change of landlord, so i kept paying the rent to the old landlord who did not cash the cheques. after 6 months, i get sued for not paying the rent. in court, when it’s my turn to speak, i ask “who the fuck you are? my lease says mr so-and-so, and you’re not him”. — er… they could not produce proof that they officially notified of the rent transfer. — case dismissed! said the judge. of course, i received the proprt rent transfer pronto after that… oh well. i was stupid and young at the time, and i did not think it could be that when the registered mail came in and i stupidly took it. it was nice while it lasted… but still, 6 months rent-free… then the stupid property management decided to sell the house for the bank. it’s one of those typical montréal houses with the big stairs outside, and they put the “for sale” sign on “my” stair. at $orkplace, i printed huge “sold” sign on day-glo crack-n-peel™ and when i come home late at night, i stick one on the “for sale” sign. looks totally official! it takes them 4-5 weeks to notice the “sold” sticker, and they scrape it off. of course, 2-3 days later, another “sold” goes up, and stays for another 3-4 weeks. rinse, lather and repeat. it took the bastards 9 months to sell the house…a coworker told me this story today, and i asked if i could post it here for you guys to enjoy. sorry if it's more of a /r/pettyrevenge story, but it seemed a bit more involved. **backstory**: so back in college a few years ago, my coworker lived in an apartment complex. the lady at the front desk was apparently a real piece of work; not friendly, never cutting anyone any slack, extremely unhelpful and unwilling to be polite. mind you, she was the face of the apartment complex; it's kinda in the job description to be polite, even when you're fucking someone over. and she was the only one who worked there. let's call her rachel. the apartment would tape a envelope for the rent check and a "newsletter" to the apartment door every month. according to my coworker, the newsletter never had any actual pertinent information in it (recipes, resident meet-ups, upcoming holidays, etc. waste of paper, literally never anything important, so he would just throw it out without reading it). ---- there were three big things that pissed him off while living there, but he assures me there were many more smaller things that weren't really worth telling me. **first strike**: his girlfriend would visit him quite often, and there was a free parking garage on the property. she would always park there. one day, she came outside and her car had been towed. after visiting the front office, they learned that the apartment had included in the newsletter for the month that they had started using parking passes and that you had to come to the office to pick one up. when he asked why they didn't tape it to the door inside the rent envelopes for the month, rachel looked at him like he was crazy. she did not offer to help with the towing cost, and he tried asking. nope. $200 bucks. **update**: he says that in all past cases when it was actually an important update, they would post an independent flier with large font on everyone's door. except for the parking pass case for some reason. **second strike**: after ten months of paying rent on time, he was one day late. $50 late charge. yes, it was his fault, but a lot of places will let it go if you've been good in the past. when he went in to ask for some leniency, she shut him down real quick. **third strike**: over new years, the hot water in the entire complex was out for nine days. when he went to the front office to ask for an update/ask if they were offering any sort of rebate for the inconvenience, rachel said not only no, but hell no. ---- so at this point apparently, he was fed up. he took one of the newsletters, scanned it in to his computer (to get the logo and the header/footer), and wrote a letter to all of the residents saying they were offering a rebate at the front office for the hot water being out for so long (making sure to emulate the voice and professionalism of the complex's writing), and to be at the office the next day between 8 am and 10 am to pick up a check. printed out 70 copies, recruited a friend, and went out at 3 am with hoodies on. they quickly posted them on all of the doors. i'm sure rachel's life was hell the next day, turning down confused and angry residents in a flurry for two hours. she even posted a facebook update on the apartment complex's wall, saying that she had the police investigating the "fraud" and dusting for fingerprints (this is a fairly large college town; they have better things to be doing). i don't think i need to tell you this, but he was never caught. p.s. he said that right as he was about to move out, rachel got fired and two polite and friendly girls manned the front office from then on. ---- **tl;dr** coworker has many bad interactions with apartment receptionist, then complicates her life by writing and posting a fake apartment announcement saying all residents were getting a rebate.to give you some background, i'm 26 years old. i've been taking care of my family my whole life, while they really never gave anything back in return. especially the last 8 years. when i turned 18/19 years old, my grandparents and my dad passed away. all the expectations were put on me to go get a job, take care of my grandparents, then their place once they passed away until we could sell it. and basically handle all the stresses and responsibilities while my mom coddled my younger brother (23 now) and they sat around watching tv all day cause they "couldn't handle it". even up until recently whenever they needed money for something, or a bill, or whatever i'd be the one to go get a job, a second job, sell some of my shit while they did nothing except say "oh..thanks". anyways, fast forward to today. i'm still living at home, taking care of my mom and brother. my mom finally got a part time job (only because she pissed away all her inheritance money) and has been working for awhile. about a month ago, my brother gets a job. yay, good for him. he tells me he's planning to move out with his girlfriend in about 6-12 months cause he wants to get out on his own. i have no problem with that, so long as we all have plan. the bills being split 3 ways is fine, but if one of us leaves, it's gonna mess everything up for the other two people, unless we have something set up. a week later he moves out. then he denies ever saying any of that. gets pissed at me because even though i'm happy for him, it sucks cause he's kind of fucking things up for us. he calls me an asshole, tells me to fuck off, and cuts me out of his life since "i don't do shit" even though i've been taking care of both their asses the last 8 years while he sits in his room all day eating taquitos and playing maplestory. he also takes his mom's car, because for some dumb reason she put the car in his name, paid it off, and is keeping him on her insurance, even though she doesn't have a car and has to walk to work now. she doesn't even get mad, or try to talk to him, she let's him do whatever cause apparently he's the good kid or whatever. so now we're in a bit of a crisis because we've got to figure out to cover his 1/3rd of everything. at this point i should also mention our bills are way higher than they should be because during one of the times i was living on my own, my mom apparently "forgot" to pay some of her bills for like 8 months. which i should also mention, during the times i lived on my own i was always paid for my costs, plus gave her money to help with her own bills, and then she would still try to mooch extra money out of me by bullshitting me about some bill or whatever and then giving that money to my brother or buying cigarettes. anyways, back to the present. i'm now scrambling for a second job. i stay up about 3 days straight, with barely 2-3 hours of sleep per night, applying for jobs online/in person, going to interviews, etc etc. what's my mom doing? watching tv and smoking e-cigs. i get on her ass to do something and she gives me the same answer she's given me the last 8 years: she'll sell something, or borrow money from a neighbor. which never happens. at this point i should also mention she's kind of a hoarder and has all my grandparents and my dads shit in the garage and backyard. apparently she can't sell the stuff yet (which she's been saying since 2005) because she needs a digital camera. even though both my girlfriend and i have explained to her hundreds of times that we have cameras on our phones, there's ebay apps. it takes two fucking seconds, but regardless, most of that stuff is shit anyways save for a few personal items and some jewelry. and she should just get off her ass and get another damn job. so i'm driving to work last night and i'm fuming. but i'm looking at everything objectively. realistically, we're behind on rent, which again, my mom doesn't care about. "oh, our landlord's nice she doesn't mind." "oh there was problems with this place before we moved in, so it's okay if we're little short." our rent is due on the 1st. we got an extension to the 5th. then the 8th. then the 15th. my mom's planning to pay this month on the 24th! every month i've always had my share, plus more, covered. it's always on her, or my brother's end that the money isn't there. so i'm looking at this and i'm like: "there's no fucking way i can do this. even if i get this month, what about next month? and the month after that?" i mean, yeah, i already work 7 days a week, i could get a 3rd, 4th, 5th job, but then i wouldn't have time to go emt school. i'd be making just enough to cover everything but i wouldn't have any extra money to get myself out and into something better. and it's at this point i say "fuck it". i'm not paying a single penny more. i've got several offers from friends to move in with them for 1/3rd of what i'm paying now, no cost for utilities or anything else. i'm good to go. i'm taking my money and gtfo. but i'm not a complete asshole, not just yet anyways. this is still going to benefit my mom as well because if she's not paying anything either she can save up her money. she's probably got 30-90 days to gtfo, and even then she could milk that by squatting or whatever. that's thousands of dollars to get another place, get a cheap car, whatever, get her shit together. she's never really had to figure things out on her own because me, or someone else would always "fix" everything. here's where my revenge comes in: i'm not on the lease. years ago, when i was living on my own, my mom wanted me to co-sign on a lease with her. and she swore up and down that it wouldn't affect anything, and that she'd handle everything, but i didn't buy it. my brother, however, did. so i'm not liable for anything. i'm leaving, and they can have fun dealing with clearing out all of mom's shit. oh and they're also required to have a professional cleaner come in and clean before they leave as well. which could be a bit costly considering my mom has a few cats that she lets do whatever they want and doesn't care. they piss on something or tear on the carpet and "oh well, the fence was kind of messed up when we got here. i don't think the landlord will care. there are 'wear and tear' laws too so i don't think she expects it to be immaculate or anything." and i'd offer to help buy getting a u-haul truck to get all their shit out, or help pay for a professional cleaning, but i'm not on the lease. oh and my brother just told me to "fuck off" and cut me out of his life a week ago while my mom just sits around not doing anything to fix the situation like she always does. so now they can both "fuck off" and "deal with it". tl;dr: lazy mom and coddled younger brother treat me like shit and only need me when they need money. brother moves out, tells to me fo, and mom puts all the shit on me. i have enough and leave and their left to deal with everything since their name is on the lease and not me. long story short, my (asshole) sister ruined the half-blood prince installment in the harry potter series. at the time, she was obsessed with twilight, and was reaching the end of the last book. she was 16, i was 13, and i was house sitting until she got home (roughly an hour from when i devise my plan). here's the plan which i started: she kept the last twilight book in her room on her shelf. i ripped out all of the necessary pages to read the big finish. i then disconnected out internet from our router (she couldn't figure out the power button on my xbox, i had nothing to worry about). she gets home, leaves her purse in the kitchen and goes to her room. she forgets her cellphone in her purse, i take it and hide it to be given back anonymously later, that way she can't call anyone for an extra book (she can't drive, she got home on her school bus, no permit). best part of all, she can't leave the house without my parents permission, which she can't get because i have hidden her and all the other phones in the house (no safety hazard, i knew where they were and were easily accessible, if you knew where they were). now comes the fun part: she's mad because she finished all of the rest of the book and finds her last necessary pages ripped out. she's searching the house first for her pages, then her cellphone/any phone, and can't find either. she's trapped in our house without her final pages or any way to get a borrowed copy. our parents finally get home from their jobs, and as they are opening the garage door i run past my sister's room and yell in her door the spoiler ending to the last twilight book, which she never read. she immediately goes to our parents and tells them everything i (supposedly) did, giving me time to cleanly (and unnoticeably) tape the pages back together, put her cellphone in her purse (she is standing at their car telling them everything, keeping them in their car), replace the home phones, and get in my room to act like i've been staring at my video games ever since i got home. there is this manager, paul, who is very impatient when it comes to me helping him. he isn't helpful when it comes to asking him questions about his problem. he wants me to just do my job and fix it without any input from him. one day he called me to come over and fix something for someone else. when he hung up, it didn't hang up right and the line was still open. i listened and the other guy was saying it wasn't a big enough deal for me to have to come over, but paul insisted, saying he likes making me work for my pay because i don't do anything. after that i'd keep hearing from my co-worker, terry, stuff like, "dude, paul really doesn't like you." paul started only dealing with terry and generally complaining about me to others. so, after figuring out how and doing lots of testing on my computer, i remotely connected to his computer and set the screen saver to turn on after 1 minute of inactivity. i also set it to lock the computer when he would move the mouse and make the screen saver turn off, so he'd have to put in his username and password each time to unlock it. nothing special there, except i set the permissions on that area of his registry to deny his account access to change the settings. in fact, i set it to deny his account the ability to view certain parts of the settings. his account could view it enough to follow the settings there and turn on the screen saver after 1 minute, but enough was denied so when he went to his screen saver settings, it showed that no screen saver was set. being an inexperienced computer user, he rebooted several times trying to fix it. as i expected and hoped, he only called terry and did so many times throughout the week. even better, terry was busy and started getting annoyed at him as well and would take a while to get around to him. i would remotely connect to his screen and watch the screen saver come on and he would move the mouse and unlock it several times in a short period of time. he started moving the mouse all the time. he got very, very upset. he even called our boss and complained. when our boss asked me about it, i said this was the first time anyone had mentioned it to me, but that i knew that paul had called terry several times over the week and thought he was dealing with whatever it was. i offered to go fix it, but he said he'd get with terry since he was the one working on it. terry would complain to me about paul's issue and say he couldn't figure it out. he wanted me to look into it, but didn't stress it much. i pushed it back on him, saying that paul obviously likes him and that he needs to call me if he wants me to fix it. i offered several suggestions that seemed like really good ideas to fix it, knowing full well that they wouldn't. after a second week of him calling terry, he then called me and i let him explain the problem to me. i asked a bunch of questions and had him try a bunch of things as he got more frustrated because he had already tried these things. he complained that terry only came by a couple times and didn't get it fixed. so, i went right over there and fixed it quickly and gave some bogus procedure that terry had suggested once and didn't get around to trying yet. i then told terry that i fixed it and that his solution was what did it. i also relayed that information to our boss and got a pat on the back for going out of my way and taking on an issue that terry was working on since he was busy with other things. paul treated me a lot better afterward and i got some good laughs to myself for 2 weeks straight.lets set out the players me, david i'm tony brother. tony owns a medical it company lets call them "it docs". well it docs was just starting quite a few years ago when it secured what was to be one of its biggest contracts ever. it was a major milestone for tony and it docs. however tony needed some assistance to properly execute on the contract. tony approached another company called (making this up) "bsob it" ran by a mr. liar tony and mr. liar had several meetings in which tony outlined the contract and his plan of action and where he'd need mr. liar assistance. mr. liar listened and verbally committed that bsob it could help and would be more then happy to help but needed more information. tony gave mr. liar the information and thought everything was just fine. when one day the doctors office called up my brother tony and said they'd no longer be interested in the contract and had just signed a deal with bsob it. tony was pissed, he came to me for advice. i'm not sure if this was good advice but the way i saw it is he was just a light weight in the game and got shafted by a heavy weight. if he went after bsob it and mr. liar today it could massively backfire. i told tony he needs to toss this way in the bin and focus on growth not revenge. he then said to me "you're right, but one day i'll get them" tony went on to grow it docs into a thriving company. when one day he had become so large he decided the most economical way to grow to acquire his competition...and he set his eyes on bsob it. in that time bsob it had lost several key contracts, and was quite a bit smaller then it was since the days of the meetings between mr. liar and my brother tony. however my brother decided to acquire this company. i suspect a lot of it had to do with the righting the injustice of yesterday tomorrow type deal. now tony was very smart in his approach. he put one of his most senior partners to be the face of the acquisition. he even went so far as to accidentally remove his picture from the ceo/founder portion of his companies website. he figured that no way would mr. liar remember it docs, and wouldn't suspect a thing. well he successfully bought out bsob it and mr. liar was still their ceo. however there is no need for two ceos...now is there? tony invited mr. liar to discuss the role that he will play with it docs. i guess mr. liar assumed that he'd retain his position and benefits. but there was no need for two ceos. so as my brother said mr. liar and him went over how the company would be structured and then tony asked mr. liar "where do you see yourself in this organization" now those meetings lasted for awhile (over the course of several days). what struck tony is mr. liar never remembered their first encounters and how mr. liar stole his client until... then in the final meeting something clicked and mr. liar said to my brother "didn't we do business together before?" my brother smirked and said "yes...we have" mr. liar said "i can't seem to recall, do you?" my brother smiled back and said "do you remember when in year xxxx a small start up medical it company came to your company for assistance with a mr. x doctors office?" mr. liar is getting uncomfortable in his chair he said "yea" my brother went onto say "well, we never did much business together because after we discussed being partners that doctors office called me up and said they were no longer doing business with me and have chosen your company over mine even though you didn't even see the opportunity until i asked for your company partnership on the deal" mr. liar was still...pretty sure he already knew what was up. my brother then said "now mr. liar my partners and senior mgt have discussed what role and what skillset you bring to the table. we simply do not see the need for your continued service in our organization and will be ending your employment with us" with that mr. liar left the company for good. and before people bash my brother mr. liar really didn't bring anything to the table besides being a business man with questionable ethics and with extremely outdated it skills.a friend of mine told me of a story from when she was a 10 year old. she was outside her house, playing with her four year old brother on the basketball court. three other boys, about her age, were nearby playing basketball. one of them threw the ball, without warning, aiming at the little boy's head in an effort to knock him to the ground. her brother, being only 4 years old, felt the full force of the ball. his hands and legs were cut and bloodied. he started crying, and the older boys howled with laughter. my friend had seen the ball hit its target, but not who threw it. she sent him straight home (they lived across the street) - he protested, thinking that she was taking the other side and feeling all the more miserable, but she stood firm and sent him to their house. when he was safely in his mother's arms, she whirled around and demanded, "who did it?" her quiet but resolute tone shut the three boys up immediately (they were each one to two years her senior). again, she insisted, "who did it?" they hemmed and hawed and denied, saying it was an accident. she kept pushing. finally, one boy copped to it, "but it was just an accident, i swear!". "yeah. right". minutes later, her little brother looked out of the family window to see his big sister, straddling a splayed-out bully, pounding and pounding his sobbing face - pride completely gone. my friend's dad had to come out and pull her off. afterwards, he didn't reprimand her at all, because she had served up a portion of sweet, delicious, revenge. tl, dr: my friend (a girl) beat the shit out of a larger bully who had it coming.oh man i've been sitting on this story for five years, and i haven't told a soul. i was living in an efficiency apartment by myself for the first time. i was approximately 20 years old and i was working two server job, both of which required a clean and presentable uniform. every three days or so i would have to do a load of work clothes and i didn't have much time to do it, between jobs. the apartment complex that i lived in had 16 apartments in it, and we all shared a washer and dryer. i had the cycle timed to the minute, and i would go to my apartment to watch a tv show or clean or something and would change my clothes from the washer to the dryer without wasting any time. i was considerate. after i had been living there for three months or so, this lady moves in and starts doing her laundry in the washer and dryer, but she had the habit of leaving it in for hours, sometimes all night. i would go to do my laundry, see that her clothes were in the washer, go back to my apartment and wait for about 30 minutes or so, go back and they would still be there. i would set an alarm for balls early in the morning to do my laundry before work and *her clothes would still be in there*. after this happened three times or so (and my uniforms were pretty dirty) i would take her clothes out of the washer and set them on top of the dryer so that i could wash my clothes. i did this a few times, then she wrote a note that said something along the lines of "if you touch my clothes again i will call the police" or something. whatever, i wrote a note back saying that she isn't the only one that has to use the laundry. she seemed to get the message for a little bit. maybe i just wasn't doing my laundry at the same time as her. but one night i was doing laundry at midnight after i had gotten off of work and my clothes were in the dryer. i set an alarm that would go off in 45 minutes, which is about how long the dryer in the complex takes. before the alarm goes off, she shows up at my door with my uniform shirts neatly folded and a shit eating grin on her face and says "you left these over there i figured i would fold them and bring them to you". 1. the shirts weren't even dry, she pulled them out before they were done. 2. i was really wanting to get my laundry done fast so i could go to bed. i just said "thanks" and slammed the door in her face. the next time i went to do my laundry *of course* hers was in there. i did my normal thing of going back to my apartment and waiting for 30 minutes or so, then going back over there to check if she had moved her clothes. to be fair, i did this for three hours. after three hours, i took a gallon of bleach and poured it all over her clothes in the washer. i don't know what got into me, i was just feeling some rage from her writing a nasty note and taking my clothes out of the dryer, folding them and giving them to me while they were wet. the next morning as i was leaving for work i saw her pulling her bleach stained clothes out of the dryer. for some reason, she didn't suspect me because she was fighting with her next door neighbor as well. go figure. she moved out soon after. tldr; lady gets mad at me for doing my laundry, i poured bleach on her trashy clothes.i work in san francisco and take the bart (train) into the city everyday. the trains, like any big city, get very full during peak hours. nothing makes me more angry than when someone thinks they are too good for the line. they think it is acceptable to just cut infront of everyone and get on the train. in the past when i have been cut off i have tried to fart or burp on them. this comes with the downside of making the entire car smell for just one person. not fair if you ask me. but today luck was on my side. this 20 something girl cut right in front of me. she got a seat and seemed very smug about her current situation. that was until her stop came. she did not foresee an irate man with a large backpack standing between her and her exit. difficult to stand up with fat man and a backpack in your way. muhaha. she did not make her exit at the time transfer station. that should give her about 30 minutes to think about the social etiquette of lines. i work for a corporation we had three companies: * company a (think low end) * company b (medium end) * company c (high end) all in the same industry, just at different quality standards/price points. each company was different and each company had similar names but where divided. now if you worked for company b like i did you couldn't sell company a or c products. and the same for everyone else. pretty much if you worked for the company you knew this but our consumers didn't, which was good cause it didn't confuse customers. then one day a bright eye ceo who should of never been a ceo decided he wanted all the company under one name! at first we thought this was a great idea. this obviously meant we could all sell each other products and offer more choices to our consumers right? well...no the sales people in a, b, c and could only sell their respective products...even though all three of them worked for the new company called company d. this pissed a lot of people off. ceo said "fuck it and went through with it" so i created numerous fake emails, and profiles and began inquiring on different products with sales people i knew couldn't sell that product, i would then escalate this compliant up to their supervisors, supervisor, supervisor until i would finally get to the ceo. at which point i would proceed to inquire again...why in the world would he do this. (keep in mind i had inside knowledge on our structure so climbing the ranks was easier) i then cited false advertising and various other laws and told the ceo unless i could work with that particular sales person (same from company b on company a product) i would sue, i did this across maybe 20~ accounts keeping each one fresh (i was a busy man) and then i pulled out my ace card, during this time i had become good drinking buddies with a consumer law lawyer (luck of the draw) and he wrote up a draft and sent it to my ceo outlying the potential law suit. the policy changed, we are still under company d but i now have the rights to sell any product to any consumer under our roof. know what the hardest part of this whole ordeal was? i was in a meeting with the ceo and he posted 8 or 9 complaints, and the lawyer letter and discussed it and explained his reasons for the change in policy. i had the biggest shit eating grin on my face cause every single one of the emails we discussed was in fact me. after the meeting i asked the ceo "so did any of those consumers convert to sales?" he goes "strangely enough no" i shook my head and said "thats a real shame" it's been quite some time since this change occurred, no one besides my wife (who helped me) even knows what i did. not only that our company is stronger then ever. turns out re branding was really smart because we consolidated our marketing resources, cleared up customer confusion, our sales people can make more money, and our consumers have a greater range of selection. so....i work in a paint and body shop, we do a lot of good quality work. we have a lot of mercedes and bmw customers, since their owners generally want the type of work that we reproduce. so does the local mercedes/bmw dealership, since we generally are better at paint and body than their own shop. the owner is a real chisler though, and is always trying to lowball us on work that she resells at a higher price through her own dealership. that alone pisses me off. then she is always at the local gallery/art spaces making her presence known in some fashion as a real patron of the arts, always gushing about some gala or another. but she is just there for the ambiance and be seen value more than any real desire to support the arts. so the other morning i'm watching the morning news. she comes on in an add for her mercedes dealership, talking about the 'song of the summer and we've got the deal of the summer'.....the commercial started with a shot of a stereo and robin thicke's blurred lines playing...her idiot crew/friends dancing....yada yada yada.... i know how cheap this woman is. plus, at the moment it really is the song of the summer. there is no way in hell that a- it's been licensed for commercial use yet, and b- that this cheap cunt would pay the fee. soooo...i get a video of the commercial on my phone. make a phone call to the offices of interscope records and ask to speak with the law department. they connect me with a gentlemen who after a bit of explanation connects me with a nice attorney for mr. thicke. i gave him all of the information, from the tv station that made/ran the commercial (and who should know copyright law inside out) to the dealerships deets. he seemed very appreciative. when informed about the video he also asked me send it to him. since it's a lawyer, i doubt that i'll ever hear anything about it (confidentiality you know), but i would like to think she got a not so nice phone call about her theft of copyright. tl/dr, get woman i don't like in trouble with lawyers for spite....(i was told to post this to /r/prorevenge in the belief that you guys would enjoy it. if it doesn't fit, my apologies, and you can remove it post-haste!) i just remembered this one while drawing in my sketchbook today. apologies for the length. when i was in middle-school, i believe 7th grade because that was a shit year all around, i was constantly bullied by a kid named d. d was just an all around dick. he thought he was hot shit because he was athletic and girls thought he was good looking. he had the snarkiest voice-like dash from the incredibles except not cool. and he had the most *punchable* face-even though this was years ago, thinking of it makes my blood boil. d had it out for me. maybe because i was smarter than him, maybe because i was *infinitely* more handsome than him, or maybe it was because i was a nerdy kid that looked like the type who should get bullied. i don't know. but he was always on my case. he would knock my stuff out of my hands in the halls, whisper about me behind my back, and constantly make attempts to fight me in order to get me in trouble. two events forced my hand. the first was when he pushed me into my locker while i was bent over picking up my stuff. my glasses snapped. i am someone who's prone to avoiding violence as much as he can, but when put into a sudden, shocking situation, i can get upset quickly. that was the case here. i turned around and went in swinging with every bit of emotional force i could muster. i only got him once in the gut before my math teacher pulled us apart. i think she knew what was up, because she left me off with a warning. d denied doing anything, and was believed. and i still had to replace my glasses, spending money that my family couldn't afford to spend. i was aware of this, and devastated. then came the final straw. d made fun of my weight in front of everyone in my art class: including the girl i had a crush on. that was it. it was like a gunshot went through me. like a needle snapping from being pushed down too hard for too long. i felt like an entirely different person. i slowly closed my sketchbook, looked straight into d's eyes with a blank, almost serial killer stare, and simply said: "you're going to get it." d gave me a weird stare, but thought nothing else of it. months passed. d slightly kept his distance from me, only bothering me now and then, probably out of fear i would do something terrible to him. this was my plan. i waited it out, and here's why: in said art class, we have a sketchbook. this sketchbook is comprised of all the work that goes into producing our final projects. when we're done with our sketchbooks, we are meant to put them into cubbies in a cabinet. the sketchbooks are turned in at the end of the trimester for a final grade. i realized, waiting outside my drama class, which was one room down from the art class, that the janitor came to clean out the art class' trashcan about five minutes after we we left the classroom. perfect. i had to time it just right. it's two days before our sketchbook is due. we all put our sketchbooks into our cubbies and leave the classroom. my art teacher starts to walk down the hall, after locking the art room. i chase her down before she turns the corner. "mrs. art!" i say. "i forgot to put *one last thing* into my sketchbook. do you mind if i can get your keys and fix it really quick? i'll turn it in to you right after i'm done, it'll only take a few minutes." after contemplating this, mrs. a decided to give me the key. she had no reason to believe anything sinister. i had been on my best behavior all trimester, *just* for this moment. i had only minutes. i rushed into the art room. then, i ripped open d's cubbie, pulled out his sketchbook, and stuffed into the trashcan. i threw in just enough scratch paper over the book to make it not look suspicious. then, i dipped out. as i left the hallway, i checked back to see that the janitor had arrived. right on time. i grinned, going to mrs. a's office. "thanks, rockblocked!" she says. "no, thank you. and can i say, this was probably the *best* art class i've ever had!" i replied, beaming. to keep a long story from going any longer, d failed the class and had to go to summer school. i knew this by watching the chaos from affair, eavesdropping on his conversations. he was moved out of my middle-school the next year. **tl;dr**: kid bullied me and called me fat in front of my crush, i executed the perfect stealth operation and ruined his art-grade, making him go to summer school and potentially moving him out of my middle-school as well.maybe you can draw a clue from my username, but i worked as an assistant manager for a retail store that sells clothing for plus-sized women. for the most part, i did my job well and the customers loved me. i was a poor performer when it came to getting customers to apply for our store card, however. the store was not in a great neighborhood and it was a recession. i didn't push the card, and my evaluations always reflected that i was a poor performer. the regional manager always made it known that he didn't like me because of this problem i had with getting people to apply. our store was also under scrutiny for having high loss (shoplifting). the store manager and the other assistant store manager were bffs. they always made their quota for credit card applications. i later found out they had a pool of social security numbers and names that they constantly reran applications with. they were cheating the system and basically making me look like crap in the process. just before july 4th, i got a text message from the store manager asking if i had put a blouse in the back to save for a later purchase. she sent a pic of the top. i told her no, it wasn't mine. the store manager then had pics up of her at a 4th of july bbq wearing the top on facebook. the store manager was always super broke. she didn't have a car, she had too many kids, she lived on state assistance. when i got to work i decided to see if the transactions showed that she bought the top. she didn't. i was furious. the company always sent loss specialists to our store to ask us if we were stealing and i hated those interviews. i emailed the head loss guy for the company and gave him screen shots of everything: the text messages, the facebook pics, the inventory screens. she was fired. i also exposed the social security number scam they were running to meet their quotas but it turns out they knew about it and were deciding what to do. in the end, i was made very uncomfortable and i quit. it turns out the regional manager was made to look really dumb and he already didn't like me.first roommate was a girl i met during community college. she was so cool. totally chill and funny. moved in with her and everything changed. she would start screaming at me because i turned the ac on..in august during 90 degree f days..even though i promised to compensate fully for it (and it turned out to just cost $30..). she would also get angry when i woke her cat up. she got so crazy hostile i would lock my door at night out of fear of her stabbing me in my sleep. so i moved out after that month, but i was still obligated to the lease. i tried to find her a new roommate that she liked, but she made the process difficult. i was getting anxious because rent was about to be due and i was not about to pay for two apartments. so i stopped giving a fuck and signed a sublease with a random, foreign 40 year-old man (i made sure he was fully aware of what he was getting into). when i told her she started yelling how i'm stupid, i don't know anything about the law, and she knows a lot more about leasing agreements since she worked at a leasing office. the look of quiet rage/frustration when i laid out everything stated in our leasing agreement and rental laws in our state..was too satisfying. add-on: a year later i was at an intersection, just about to take a right turn.. she was coming the opposite way and sped up real fast to take a left in a dangerous attempt to cut me off. i saw this and stopped. my mom, who never met my ex-roommate, was in the passenger seat and turned to me in utter disbelief, wondering what just happened. certified crazy. sort of satisfying knowing that our battle's conclusion still got this crazy person's feathers ruffled. second story: for my senior year i lucked out with rooming with two very good friends of mine. this was only because their third roommate, squeals, had an internship opportunity for that semester, so i would have to find someplace else for the spring, which was fine. i call her squeals because she doesn't talk, she squeals in a really soft voice so you can't understand a damn thing she's saying. roommates confirmed she adopted this voice to appear cute to guys. incoherent as fuck, but somehow she gets a lot of guys. anyway, i was seriously hoping that she wouldn't be back for spring so i could room with these two awesome girls. so i was really excited when squeals was telling everyone she wasn't coming back for spring!! then rather last minute..she was coming back, so i had to get an apartment fast. i put a hefty deposit on one. then she's not coming back..and begs me to take her place. i do so because the roommates, price, and location are awesome..but i still lose that deposit and i mention it to her. she didn't even say sorry or even acknowledge the suckiness of it, which was what i know i would do if i were in her shoes. she changed her mind three freaking times without thinking about anything. i was outraged, and so were my roommates so we started plotting together. i never had any kind of written lease agreement with this girl, which i knew i could use to my advantage at the end. i convinced her i was going to take over for the summer, even though i was leaving three months beforehand.. i told her the day i was moving out, and that left squeals responsible for three months' rent. tl;dr: two different girls got into rental agreements with me. i made the first one live with a much older stranger. the second one had to pay $1500+ for nobody to live in her room. edit: i get that this isn't as extreme or interesting as one would hope for this subreddit, but it wasn't small enough to go on pettyrevenge. edit 2: i didn't know there would be a couple revenge-based subreddits!! this is because i honestly thought people would be too ashamed to talk about it since i'm ashamed of my own scheming (sheltered, much). up until now i thought pettyrevenge was as hardcore as it got. love all this though. makes my brain jizz. the stage is the local big-box retailer parking lot. i’d parked my ford explorer on the side of the store between two minivans, and as such, my visibility for backing out of my space was impaired. i ease out slowly only to hear a furious horn and a red dodge neon fly by, coming from the backside of the store. damn, lady, excuuuuse me! i finish my backing procedure and see her waiting at the end of the row about even with the front of the store. she’s right in the middle and i have enough room to get around her on the right and turn right to exit the lot. i do so, and as i’m pulling away i see her in my rearview mirror, gassing it hard coming after me. oh, so you want to discuss this further, do you? i hit the brakes, kinda hard, and you can guess the predictable outcome. keep in mind this is a truck. i tow a small camper. it’s got a class iii receiver hitch. these do not give. at all. i hop out and see that she has impaled the nose of her pretty little red car on my hitch. there is coolant. there is transmission fluid. there are words, many of them foul, from both her and her passenger boyfriend. i smile as the language pours forth, until she gets to the part where she exclaims that her father is on the police force and i'm going to be sorry. at that point i inform her that in the case of a rear-end collision, the rearmost vehicle is almost always cited for failure to maintain a safe following distance and her father should be able to explain that to her. police are called and some random patrolman shows up. statements are taken, but no citations are issued as it’s private property. i see her and her friend pull away, trailing fluids, and as a last measure of justice, i see her car doesn’t even have a permanent tag yet, just a paper dealership plate. i pop back into the store to buy a new trailer plug connector. lemme start by saying that i went to a mexican high school. one of the bad ones. it was a technical school, so i chose a course about computers. the place was such a mess it was either that or a food-related course, so it wasn't much of a choice. anyway, my class was divided by nerds and idiots, but like, jocky, buffed idiot bullies. it was a pretty tense class, especially since i was very much a nerd. on the bus ride home one day, i had an argument with my girlfriend, so we ended up not talking to each other. i noticed one guy from our class was staring at us. he was one of the more annoying bullies, and most of my friends had already had to trade blows with him before, so i just glared at him and forgot about him. i soon got to my stop and left the bus, without saying goodbye to my girlfriend. later my girlfriend sends me an im telling me that she doesn't want me to get angry or get in trouble. i ask her what happened. she hesitantly tells me the guy sat with her the moment i left, asked her if she wouldn't rather have him as her man, and since she was too scared and shy to tell him anything else than to go away, she began groping her leg for a while until the bus reached her stop and she left. i'm pretty pissed, at this point. the next day i see the guy at school, but i don't say a word to him. fights were pretty common at that place, but i at least wanted to do it outside, after school, so all i can do is glare at him all day and wait. i almost made it. five minutes left to leave school, and he apparently snaps. he couldn't take me staring daggers at him all day long and got up right to my face, talked trash and shoved me. now, i know that a shove in that context means either a fight or pussying out, and i wasn't going to pussy out. i might be a nerd, but i'm pretty tall and thick, so his shove doesn't even budge me and i punch him right in the face. i aimed for his nose, but he managed to crouch at the last second. i still hit him right on the forehead, and he lands right on his ass. i'm about to kick him in the face, but one of my friends stops me. she's begging me to stop, and i realize the teacher's still in the classroom. i take my stuff and leave with my girlfriend. pretty much the entire class congratulates me. somebody even told me i did something everybody had wanted to do since for a while now. i hear the asshole behind me shouting that my girlfriend is a liar. i turn around just in time to see my teacher drag him by the arm to the principal's office. the little dick tries to explain that i punched him for no reason, and my teacher tells him to shut up and that she's fed up with him. a couple of weeks later he drops out of school. some months later i read in the newspaper that he and his buddies were arrested for driving under the influence, carrying loaded weapons and trying to bribe the cops that arrested them. turns out they were trying to threaten a wealthy ranch owner or something. good riddance, i say. this was a couple of years back, presently i still occasionally see him in the street. i look directly at him every time, not once has he been able to look back. sorry for this being a bit long. dreams do come true, i suppose is the lesson learnt by this.edit: i speak french so excuse my poor english. scroll down to "where the fun starts" to skip the pre-school fight. i had this really close friend, let's call her bsb (backstabbing bitch), who was talking so much shit behind my back without me ever knowing. i always had doubts that something was fishy but i was not able to prove it. one day a random guy who was a closer friend to me sent me all the text bsb sent him. she was saying stuff like i was just a trash not good enough to be friend with her (she was 22) and that i was fired. bsb said all these things without ever telling me that there was a problem between us so i had no idea what was going on. i confronted bsb by showing her the messages. maybe i was a fool, but i was expecting explanations or apologies. it got bad. instead of taking the blame bsb said my life was over because there was rumours that a guy leaked nudes of me. all this was my fault and i should move out of town, dye my hair, because i was just a whore here. i replied saying i would have told her and defended her if something like that happened to her. i ended the friendship there. they have a family business and i used to help them with some work they couldn't do themselves. i was pretty much the only person in the area to do my job so they were not in a good situation. her mother called me a few times saying she needed some help but i was not changing my mind, it was a no for me. i waited for a year. i waited for apologies, but they never came. out of the blue, bsb sent me a facebook link about soap making(cauz i like soaps) like nothing happened between us. maybe it was to remember herself that she never did anything wrong. i lost my shit there. **this is where the fun starts** revenge is a best dish served cold. i used to help them with their family business for the past 8 years. i knew details of how the business worked and i knew pretty much everything on how they hid money from the irs. i called the irs and told them everything. i told them how they hid the money and where they could get all the proof of their real sales. their real sale is around 30 000$ a month, and they probably declare half of that. when someone was paying them cash they would duplicate the invoice, giving two invoices with the same number to different clients. the catch is, each item they sold had to be inspected by a professional. that professional also had to add a piece to the item before it was sent to the client. the irs only has to ask for the invoices at that professional and they have all the proof of bsb's real sale. they were also shipping every item under their care and the buyer had to pay a 100$ fee cash to the shipper. there is even the details of it on their website. what a bunch of idiots.so, i was about 17yrs old at the time. i was in the raf cadets through school and lucky enough to get on the glider training course. this basically involves being on an raf base for a week while being taught how to fly a glider. awesome! there were about 5 of us on the course and one older lad probably 19-20. he was a warrant officer, but not a real one, just in the cadets like us. however, the actual officers had put him in charge and he was on a more advanced course than us. this made him think he was the man. none of us knew each other beforehand but the 5 of us quickly became friends and the dickhead was an outsider from day 1. it didn't seem to bother him as he fucking hated us and didn't want to talk to us anyway. fair enough however, he started trying to impose all sorts of rules on us…for example we had to attend breakfast in uniform. well that was bullshit because we didn't wear uniform during the day - just a tshirt under the flying suit. and wearing uniform meant we had to march around the base rather than walk and salute people….fuck off. he also tried to impose curfews and other dumb rules. initially we just told him we weren't going to do anything he said but the snitch told the actual officers and then we had to…. well, nobody likes snitches. so heres what we did. while he was out we took some wood from the forest and chiselled it into wedges. we then hammered it into place such that the window in his room could not be opened at all from inside. when he came back we very quietly tied some rope to his door handle and then to another door handle so that he couldn't open his door from inside his room. we then got a sheet of paper and lit it on fire to create a load of smoke and then put it out - we didn't want an actual fire. then we hit the smoke alarm. the dickhead literally shat himself when he realised he was trapped in his room and heard the rest of us shouting "get out etc". he started shouting at first and then it turned to screaming. he was pounding and pounding on the door. eventually we let him out - we had to because we had to call the front gate (security) and tell them it was a false alarm - and make sure everything was ok if they came to check it out. anyway, this fat fuck had tears streaming down his face and just ran off saying he was going to get us fucked up. it was great because there were no repercussions for us and he never spoke to any of us and therefore never tried to bully us again. moral of the story: don't be a fat cunt i work for a privately owned, fairly large sales company with $500 million a year in sales. our business model relies on a talented sales force to bring in the revenue. our founder very early on in his days brought on a young man who went on to become our ceo for over 30 years. this ceo was responsible for our massive growth and mergers with other players in the same field. he made this company great, and his motto was this "the sales force always comes first" he understood that in this business environment that was very competitive the only way to succeed was with a properly, well trained sales force. because of him we have the best compensation package in the industry. in 2006 old age struck him down and in 2007 he passed away surrounded by family, and loyal long term co-workers. at first the company decided they would simply use the vps to run the company, kind of like a democracy around them. they let things go and we did alright. however in 2008-2009 we experienced some extreme hardship due largely to the economy. in 2010 it was decided to bring in a ceo to lead the road to recovery. when the new ceo came in 2010 he decided the best course of action was cost cutting and layoffs. he also decided that the sales force had too many products and cut the sales force in two team. one side of the sales force sold product a the other side sold product b. although both options are from the same industry, they provide different benefits and disadvantages and depending on your customer product a might be better or product b might be better. this created a lot of tension among the sales team. never the less he was the ceo and could do as he please at least he left our compensation package alone. just to qualify how frustrating this is imagine you have customer a come in, and you’re on team b however customer a is you’re customer and he wants product a. you have to hand over that customer to team a and lose the deal. before you could just sell him product a and be happy. well it came to our yearly meeting where we celebrate our success and discuss how next year can be better. their was a really dirty rumor going around that the commission agreement was going to be cut significantly. this didn't sit well among the sales force. so the top 20% of the sales force gathered together, by the way the top 20% produced approximately 70% of the sales. we held the majority of the company revenue and profits in our hands. we all agreed prior to the meeting when the new plan was to be unveiled if it would result in a significant cut of more then 8% we'd walk out of the room. this is a company of 250 people, 180 of which are the sales force. the commission plan was unveiled with the new ceo at the top of the stage explaining how this was necessary to protect the company future. a 25% pay cut...what the hell was this man thinking? his justification? its still above industry average. well our costs are below industry average cause we have an excellent sales team who reduces your costs therefore pay us. never the less a heated exchange/debate went on. when finally with the ceo not budging when one of the best sales person stood up and said to the ceo that a large majority of the sales staff had heard we might be getting a pay cut and had agreed that if we did we'd walk out the door. to which the ceo responded "then you will be terminated for insubordination and replaced" btw the guy who he said this to produced $25 million dollar in revenue the year before. all of us at the same time got up and walked out of that conference room. in total the 37 of us who walked out of that conference room were responsible for $350 million dollars of the company revenue. the vps were very worried. if you think 2009 was bad imagine losing a huge chunk of your most talented sales people. very quickly the sales vp pulled me aside and asked me what was going on i explained to him that we hated what this ceo has done to this company and we want him out. the vp also asked other sales people and the opinion among the staff was the same. we were told to take a break and they'd figure something out. 2 hours later myself and 2 others were called into a meeting to represent the sale staff. it was myself and 2 others, along with the vp of marketing, sales, accounting, product mgt, a lawyer or two, and the family was on the phone. we had a an agreement signed by the a large chunk of the sales staff that demanded one of two outcomes 3% pay increase or ceo resign, and the products no longer be divided with the same commission agreement as before however it not be cut. needless to say the ceo was unhappy with the agreement and decided to stand firm. it was obvious to everyone that ceo was the only one that was going stand firm, i guess his ego was blinding him. after we refused to budge on our demands (to be fair the vp team wasn't that inclined to argue with us we were asked to leave. the next morning we were all called into the conference room. the vp of sales got up on the stage and basically said "as you can see mr. dickhead isn't here anymore...he decided to pursue a different career path and resign. we have since decided to make some changes to our business our products again will be all under one team, and the commission agreement will be unchanged" since then we've vowed to not have a ceo, our founders son acts as a silent ceo. so just because your the ceo and your the boss doesn't mean you can do anything you like. by the way since 2010 we've grown significantly even in this challenging environment. x-post from petty revenge i worked for a small company that manufactured and sold things found in small retail stores. i was the customer service manager and had a few sales reps that worked for me. basically we would call stores who carried our products and check to see if they needed to order anything. also we would call stores who didn't carry our products, tell them about our products, send them samples, and then get them to order from us. i had a small staff of 4 sales representatives. this was not an easy job but it paid well. now i was good friends with the owner of the company. he was never there and i ran things for him. i was introduced to him by a former colleague named john. john used to run a small investment group at the same office. he would take investment sales calls and then get a group of people with money to invest. so john was no longer there but he would get sales calls on our main phone line. people trying to sell investment opportunities in oil &amp; gas or some technology start up. all sorts of crazy stuff and the salesmen were top notch professional sales guys. in other words aggressive, so i would have the calls transferred to me. then i would explain that john wasn't here anymore and they would stop calling us. jessica was one of our better reps. she was an aggressive but well mannered woman. in fact she was a bit of a firecracker but in a good way. so one day jessica gets a call from a deep voiced man asking "is john in?" she says he isn't there and is about to ask him to hold for one second so she can transfer the call to me. but the guy hangs up on her mid sentence. she bitches to me in a no big deal kind of way but basically says can you believe the nerve of some people. we move on with our day. the next day she answers the main line and a deep voiced man asks "is john in?" she says no and he hangs up on her before she can utter another word. she tells me in a slightly disturbed manner. i tell her if he calls again to tell him that john doesn't work here anymore. the next day she gets another call from the deep voiced man. he asks "is john in?" and she says "no, he doesn't work here anymore!" but he hung up as soon as he heard the word no. i don't know if you have any experience with sales but you need to have a good attitude. i need jessica to be in good spirits. hanging up on someone is one of the rudest things you can do on the planet. jessica is fuming. this is really getting to her. so i think some revenge is necessary. i tell jessica that when this guy calls tomorrow and asks if john is in to tell him "yes, please hold on for one second while i transfer you." sure enough the guy calls the next day and jessica transfers him to me. i put him on speaker phone and tell jessica to come sit in my office in order to listen to the call. i close the door. i know how to talk the talk when it comes to investments. i ask him his first and last name. his first name was david. then the company he works for and then i say our phone lines are having problems. i asked him "what is your direct phone number in case we get cut off?" so i listen to his sales pitch about investing in real estate development. i ask him some good questions. signs that i am going to invest like "what kind of roi can i expect?" and "is there a limit on how much one person can invest?" at this point the guy thinks i am the whale that is going to put his kids through college. i then begin to share my story. what we do here. that we are in the business of selling also. that i have sales representatives that work for me. then i switch my tone completely. i was raised by a former marine and i know how to chew someone out. so i go all [r. lee ermey]( on his ass. i shout "are you thick in the head?" david says in a stunned and offended voice "excuse me?" i continue "are you slow or something?" david "no!" me "then why have you been calling here everyday and hanging up on my employees while they are mid sentence?" jessica looks at me like i just gave her every xmas present she ever wanted. david "i haven't been doing that, i think there is some kind of misunderstanding." "listen david, you have been set up! we don't get many incoming phone calls. everyday for the last 4 days you have been calling us at about the same time. you have a very distinct voice. we have been waiting for you to call today. there is no doubt that you have been calling my office and hanging up on the person as soon as they say the word no. your calls have been upsetting my peaceful office and we decided to take your sales call today!" david "uhh, (long pause) i didn't mean anything by it" "who is running the business over there?" david says in a meek voice "i am." "am i supposed to believe you are the owner of the company?" david "no" "who do you report to?" david finally gives me his boss's name and phone number. he also tells when he comes into the office next and i tell david he should probably confess to his boss before i call him. david agrees and apologizes. i end the call and jessica says "that was the best thing to ever happen" needless to say we didn't get any more calls from david. i never called his boss either. i thought our conversation was punishment enough and i am willing to bet david never hung up on anyone again.this is a bit of a long one, but i think the payoffs are worth it. there are two payoffs - my revenge, and karma also steps in with one of its own. mine is not a direct tit-for-tat revenge, but one final big payback to a major asshole who has it coming. i posted in /r/pettyrevenge and it was suggested i move it here. many years ago i lived with a real douchebag roomate, a 30-year old scumbag steve personified - doesn't pay bills(but racks them up), doesn't clean(but makes messes), you get the idea. sorry, but some character development is required. he's also really bad with his money - his paycheque goes straight to the vlts, then he's broke for 13 days til the next payday. he spends those 13 days on the computer(that he made zero payments on) in his bedroom, trying to meet women online. of course online, he can be anyone he wants to be, not a pathetic loser, so online he does pretty well. and in creating his phony life online, he uses achievements of people he knows in real life(this matters later). oh, and i need to mention he's a deadbeat dad. has 10 year old twin boys, and brags about how he's never paid a cent in child support. can't have utilities in his name, won't file a tax return, all to hide from child support. owes tens of thousands, if not more. i tried turning him in for it, but faced a wall of bureaucracy and apathy i couldn't penetrate. so let's call him dd for deadbeat dad. anyway, he meets a young woman from colombia online, and over a few months they fall for each other. of course she's falling for a total liar and fraud. and she seems to be a genuinely nice girl. she thinks she's meeting a nice guy who wants to start a family some day(kids are very important to her). dd repeatedly makes clear she's never to know about his kids or child support issues. she really doesn't deserve this guy to happen to her. they decide it's time for him to go to colombia so they can finally meet. she just wants to meet - of course as far as dd the mooch is concerned, he's going to stay for life and mooch off her(apparently her family doing well; not wealthy but mooch-worthy). so he "saves up" (doesn't pay any bills) enough to go, and by enough to go, i mean just enough for the plane ticket - and literally not another dime in the world. he's all in on this trip. now this was around 2000...no smartphones, no tablets, no airport wifi...the second he leaves the house, he's disconnected til he gets to colombia. so the instant his ride pulled out of the driveway, i signed into dd's email, and sent her a simple one sentence email - "ask me about my kids when i get there." apparently it went over about exactly as well as i'd hoped. they were over before they left the airport. now of course, dd has no money and his return flight isn't for a month. and her family doesn't want him at their house anymore, obviously. but there's a saving grace for him - he'd told her during their courtship that he'd studied to teach esl and is fully qualified to do so(in reality it was his boss at his former job who'd done it - dd is barely literate and couldn't teach stink to shit)...well her dad is apparently a higher-up in colombia's department of education(their equivalent) and a very nice guy, and had found dd a job he could have once he arrived, as a surprise. now he only offers the job to save face himself at work, and to get dd to earn money to go home, get his own place, basically get out of their lives. all he has to do is provide proof of his credentials. of which he has none whatsoever. tl;dr - scumbag steve flies halfway around the world to get told off and lose everything.(story contains some obscenities, beware) at one point a couple of years ago i worked for a calling center. basically that's what it was, literally. people would receive different letters from different clients of ours and call in to schedule an appointment if they were interested. pretty harmless stuff, at least i wasn't calling people out of the blue and bugging them. so one day, a couple of months into the job i received a call. i started out with the normal "thank you for calling, am i speaking with (said his name. all of the letters sent out obviously had name and address on them, so saying their name made it a bit more personal and less robotic) he confirmed that yes i was and spent the next 45 seconds calling me every name in the book. he told me he was sick of getting the letters that i was a cunt and that i was a slut and a whore and if "i lived any closer to your office i would come over and beat your brains in with a fucking baseball bat, skank" when i could finally get a word in edgewise i told him we would be more than happy to put him on the do not call list and to have a nice day. right before i was able to hang up he yelled "don't you fucking hang up on me cunt, i will find you and kill you" okay, first of all i was working from home 4 states away from the return address he had received, so i wasn't too worried about that. it just pissed me off that he made the choice to pick up the phone and call the # from a letter that he obviously wasn't interested in. he could have just thrown it away. so later that day, when things slowed down a bit i did a google on his name (it's a pretty rare name) and found out 2 things. 1)he has a facebook with 2 friends (1 of them being his mother, the other being his brother) and loves playing farmville. 2) he is a fucking neo-nazi who makes comments on some pretty extreme websites. this includes (but is not limited to) threats against the dirty whores who live across the street to him (he wanted to rape them until they bled, so they knew what real pain was) threats against minorities annnnnnnnnnnnnd threats against the president. now i am not saying this happened but the fbi may or *cough* not have received an attachment with this guys name, phone # and address along with copies of his threats to the commander in chief. i mean, maybe that happened. who knows? :) be careful who you are a dick too, i guess is the moral of the story. or just don't be a dick. even better!this happened years ago. there was a spike of petty vandalism going on along my road. i live in the rural bit of town and after ~10 at night it's abandoned and easy to flee from, which made it an ideal target. mostly it was teenagers going down the road and hitting mailboxes with a baseball bat. every week. my neighbor decided he was sick of it. under the guise of 'reinforcing' the post, he installed a metal pole between his mailbox and his newspaperbox. it was hard to see during the day, much less detectable at night while doing 60 down a country road. it was also planted well into the ground with a little concrete for good measure. he said he saw it happen from his porch one night. the car was barreling down the road and mailboxes were flying off whenever it passed them. then the car got to his and there was a scream as it kept driving. the next day, you could see the ruined mailboxes up until his. at his, there were two halves of a wooden baseball bat. he said he actually felt kind of bad for the idiot as he thought they would be cruising down the road and it would just give them a jolt, but the kind of people who go down the road smashing mailboxes are not the kind to drive slow with your friend hanging out the window swinging a bat (that would require intelligence). god knows what it did to that asshole's arm.i was the tech support lead working on a government program supporting aeronautical engineers. very smart people. most had doctor or masters degrees in their particular field. all in all nice people but a few had zero people skills and were a pain to deal with. anyways, one of my workers (we'll call him ben) had this beat down look on his face after getting off a call. ben was a super nice kid. always had a smile on his face, so i knew something was up. he said he just got off the phone with the "grump" (not this real name of course.). apparently the grump had forgotten his password twice already and called back cussing poor ben out about the password complexity requirements. (nothing too crazy. password had to be 14 in length with at least one upper/lower case letter and one special character). ben said the grump hung up on him and didn't think he figured out a new password yet. told my team i'd take his call next time. me: techsupport, how can i help you? grump: fu#k you @ssholes! i can't get this #$%@&amp;! new password to work and i've tried 50 $%&amp;@#$%$ times!! me: i'm sorry to hear about that. lets try a different password together. it needs to be 14 in length with at least one upper/lower case letter and one special character. maybe like "everythingisawesome!" grump: how about "i-f*cking-hate-it" (no special character was used) me: well the length is right but you were yelling so it sounded like all up case letters and i didn't hear any special character. grump: @#$#$%@ @#$%@#$% get you're &amp;%@#$% i'm not dealing with this #@$%@#$ !@#$!@#$ f*ck you!!!! click after he hung up, i looked over at ben and saw a smile jump across his face as i told him to disable grump's account. i sent an email to management letting them know what happened and firmly stating my staff will not be treated this way. an hour later, i got a call from my lead apologizing about the grump. hr had spoken to him. then said i needed to enable his account and create a new password for him. i personally delivered the new password to mr. grump, which by the way is about 5 foot nothing and maybe 100 pounds. he didn't speak a word to me as i dropped the note card off. the note card read: (remember passwords need to be 14 characters in length or longer with at least one upper and one lower case letter and one special character) your new password is "itf*ckinghatesyou2" this story is from a female friend i had in college, and took place almost 30 years ago now. she had an apartment that had a school basketball court right behind it. one afternoon she was studying for exams and these dickhead teens in a fancy car showed up, parked with the sunroof and doors open, and began to shoot some hoops while blasting some shitty music loud enough to rattle her windows. she tried to do the right thing at first...she went out and kindly asked them to turn it down a bit. they responded with a long stream of abuse such as "fuck you cunt! stupid whore!" etc and laughed about it. they did not turn down the music. this loud music went on for about another 40 minutes. at one point, she looked out the window and observed that they had left the car there with the doors open, music still blasting, but had moved alllll the way across the field which was about the length of a football field. so she grabbed a bucket and filled it with an entire gallon bottle of liquid bleach, took it outside, and poured it all over the interior of the car. all over the seats and the floor and the dash. they did not even come back to the car for another 20 minutes or so, leaving the bleach more time to do it's magic. she knew they came back when the music stopped and she heard them yelling "what the fuck?????? shit!!!" and a stream of other such stuff. they were super angry and were looking all around. they may have suspected her, but they had no idea where she came from and they did not see her now. she told me they got in an drove away, which means they had to sit in it too, hopefully ruing their clothes and maybe even burning them. i don't know the girl anymore..largely because she was evil and i was afraid of her myself, but i always think of that story whenever someone pisses me off with a parked car.my dad used to be an extremely fit guy back in the day (i.e. before he had teenage sons) and has gained a lot of weight and with it came diabetes. after being in denial for a year, he came to terms with it and started eating right again and bringing his lunch to work instead of hitting the grill for a quick burger and fries to and started exercising again to help lose weight. after a while, he noticed his meals going missing out of the fridge at work and he started asking around to his co-workers and most of then pointed out "ralph" was eating whatever container my dad described his food being in. he approached "ralph" about it and ralph quickly fessed up and said it wouldn't happen again, but he continued anyway. after a while, my dad got aggravated not because he would have to find a replacement for his meal, but because this guy would blatantly eat the food in front of people not giving two cares who saw. so my dad hatched a plan. he decided to make ex-lax brownies and bring a plate to work with him. now most of his co-workers hated "ralph" because he's already eaten their food and ended up in on the joke. so they knew to steer clear. my dad walks in with his "lunch" and sees ralph chilling out. he tells ralph to stay away from his lunch and not to eat it and ralph agrees to do it. needless to say, food went missing and ralph ran between his office and the bathroom so many times, he ended up shitting himself. after cleaning up as much as he could, ralph went to the boss and ratted my dad out saying he was poisoned by him. my dad gets called in, is asked about his "food" and told the boss that he told ralph to stay away from the food. boss looks at ralph and asks if this is true, ralph says "that's not the point." boss responds with sending him home because he smelled like shit and ended up transferring him to another branch a week later. tl;dr my dad got tired of his asshole coworker eating his lunch that he slipped ex lax brownies as revenge i just found this thread and reading some of these inspired to jot down my own. (for the revenge itself just skip down below) so i've always had a ... rough relationship with my father. he's a good man, a good provider, and truly and deeply cares for me and my mom/siblings. i don't want my story to suggest otherwise, i love my father very much and have always treated him with respect and learned to deal with his nature. **back story** that said he can be a cantankerous son of a bitch, an authoritarian regime at home, and short temper when confronted in anyway. by way of example when i went far far away to college, my first trip back home i decide to be nice and buy gifts for my immediate family. i get home give everyone their gift. i bought my dad a great $60 cigar, he's really hard to shop for. after the gifts are handed out he takes me aside and goes "never get me another gift with my own money (he was paying for my school at the time), if i want something i'll buy it - i don't need you to do it." after i graduated college i got a job in the legal field within a week of graduation. at the time i was living at home. after 3 months my work was ramping up like crazy. that month i averaged about 120 hours a week at work. i didn't have a day off the entire month including weekends. so after 5 weeks of this kind of schedule there's a brief lull and i get 1 day off (saturday). this was completely unexpected and because of this my mother was not at home that day. (in light of my dad's temper she had a personal rule to never to allow ~~us~~ edit: my dad and i to be home together without supervision - a wise rule). well that day it was just the two of us and my two kid sisters. long story short he throws me out of the house that night and in 12 hours everything i own is in the back of my car as i report back to work another 120 hours that week. **revenge** i got my own apartment and life moved on. fast forward two years later. we as a family have a big anniversary - 25 years since we moved to america (we're first generation immigrants). leading up to the event i learned from my grandparents that they actually brought all of my dad's vinyl records from when he was a teenager with them to america. the kicker was my dad either forgot or didn't know this at all. so i get a great gift idea. i bought a vinyl to mp3 converter and went through and digitized the exact songs of my dads teenage years as a gift for him. so come the big day, our 25 years in america. i take my dad aside and tell him i have a gift for him if he wants it. his response was along the lines of "eh, fuck that." i look him the eye and say in our native tongue, "no gift, no problem" and throw the thumb drive in the trash and walk away. turns out my grandfather told my dad the next day what the gift was and my dad actually cried (something i've never seen). i would never wish my father ill, but i have no problem saying "no gift, no problem."a few years ago i entered some of my photographs in the amateur section of the county fair. while looking through my competition i notice one is submitted by a professional photographer from the area. just to make sure it was who i thought it was i stuck around at the end and watched them pick their photo up. at the time i was working at the local college as an event manager. i ran concerts, various smaller events, fundraisers, and helped plan graduation. this same professional photograph asked for permission to photograph our larger rock concert. i denied it. the photographer submitted a quote to photograph the fund raiser; i denied it. finally it comes to graduation. as graduation approaches i receive another quote from the photog along with several others wanting the job. the session fee from the offending photographer is reasonable and the package deals that would be offered to the students for purchase were competitive with the other offers, but i denied it. this photographer lost out on about $800 of session fees, the chance to sell prints to 400 students for an hour shoot, and a nice portfolio building opportunity. all they got was a $40 prize from the county fair. edit: the photog in question was operating out of their own studio and had been advertising as a professional photographer for a few years minimum from what records i ran across. greetings, first post on reddit. i work for a direct lending company in loan origination. this job is almost 100% commission and getting paid relies heavily on me guiding potential borrowers through the application process and babysitting their app through the funding stage. the money can be great; the only drawback is long hours and a lot of time wasted on absolute shit leads. the leads come from online sources and are weeded out through our jr. sales (basically low level, low skill selling), who's primary job function is to transfer interested parties to us licensed officers. this can lead to what could be considered a minor conflict of interest. the jr.'s goal is to have as many transfers as possible.... resulting in low quality transfers (people who were either tricked or not that serious and only want market rates and to say bye). needless to say, some of the jr.s send over some junk ass leads on a constant basis. i'm talking mainly about using deception or dishonesty to trick borrowers into speaking with me. this wastes my time and leads to many unpleasant and pointless conversations. time is money. after several attempts to remedy this through their dept. managers, i decided to get even. this is my paycheck you're starting to really fuck with here. i found out their personal phone numbers using my company directory and sent some inquiries to our lending partners stating they wanted information on refinancing. by 'some' i mean 'a lot'. and by 'a lot' i mean every single partner i've ever dealt with in the past. for any reference on how annoying this can turn out to be, go on lowermybills.com and enter in your name and phone #. within seconds the calls will start. and they won't stop until you answer every. single. company that ends up getting your info and asking to have your number taken off the list. lowermybills.com is just one of our partners. we have seven in total. tl;dr - coworkers in another department send me shitty leads to boost their daily numbers, fucking me over, so i get them some numbers of their own. enjoy changing your phone numbers, guys. be a little more ethical in the future. edit: i just noticed i left out a pretty important part, which is the fact that since the leads went through our partners, they were sent to our systems, leading the jr.s to unwittingly autodial their own cellphones a couple of times. they're bothering themselves. i was a rebellious little kid since young, and as far as i could remember, this happened when i was about 11. my mum had a friend from china, and that friend has a daughter. let's call her d in this case. d came to singapore to study, and my mum wanted to help out by letting her to stay in our house while she continue her education. she was about 15 at that time, if i wasn't wrong. i remember there was this once she claimed that she has lost one of her accessories and her bottle of fingernail polish, to which she made a big fuss out of it. being so innocent, i offered to find it for her, which i did. that bitch then went to tell my mother that i was the one that had stolen her items because i found it so fast, and despite my cries and my pleas that i merely helped her to find it, my mother refused to believe me. and because of her, that following night i was canned and sent to bed without dinner, and not to mention all the additional punishment i was made to do the following day. since then, i bore a grudge towards her and i crafted out a plan. she had her own room, and whenever she heads out, she would lock it up. my mother has a pair of spare keys which she had cleverly hidden somewhere in the house. so one day, i happened to find out where the keys were and i used them to gain access to her room. during that day, she didn't bring her phone out and she had also left some electrical devices on her desk. i stumbled upon a clear nail polish remover on her desk as well and i had this brilliant idea of what it seemed like a revenge. i poured the nail polish on all the electrical stuff i could think of, including the insides of her phone. i then locked her door and put back the keys. that following night, i heard screams from her room. followed by my mum's shouting of "i don't think it's my daughter! she doesn't even have access to your room!!" and that following day, i found the room vacant. my mum then explained to me that d had moved out. her room, has now been transformed into my room. and 7 years later, i still think that it's the best revenge prank i've ever had since i was a kid. not me, but my wife and i were in a chinese restaurant in sacramento and enjoying a nice dinner. a few feet away from us is a table with two semi-ghetto high school age girls. they had ordered this special meal (huge combo of a ton of different foods meant for two or more). suddenly we hear this yelling and the two girls have booked into the parking lot with the waitress unable to catch up. after being pretty upset, the waitresses start to clean up the plates and then start laughing. as we were regulars, they came and told us the story. bitch left her brand new iphone. i laughed and told her to call the cops. she said "no, i sell the phone, it's worth more!" we all had a good laugh until this fat lady walks in and discretely says "i think you found my phone" as we were walking out. the waitress gleefully replied: oh yes, we found it! i think you accidentally forgot to pay your bill, though!" awesome dinner. tl;dr king hippo tried to book on a $60 dinner and left her $400 phone. baby huey had to roll her ass back and pay the bill.i went to check my email on our shared computer and discovered it was already logged into an account my wife had made to correspond with her affair partner. when i realized who this other person was, a lot of things made sense in hindsight about how my wife had been acting the past several months. the top email included the hotel, room number, and time they were set to meet. i picked up her elderly (and very traditional) parents and told them i had a surprise. i took them up to the hotel and found the room. i pretended to be room service when i knocked and my wife answered in a state of undress. her parents were really confused and she was extremely embarrassed, then immediately angry. i said something like "have a nice life" and left. from what i heard, my wife had to rely on her affair partner to drive her parents home since my wife didn't have her own car at the hotel. she thrives on her parent's opinion of her. she always felt growing up that she never measured up to their standards, so their approval was very important to her. marriage is a big value to them, and she got caught red-handed cheating. from what i understand, she is still very much on bad terms with her father as a result. edit: this is not my story. i compiled it from comments in another thread. ~~rule 4 states to copy the text instead of providing a link.~~ mod confirmed it's okay to also provide the link. [link to the original thread.]( this story starts out back almost ten or twelve years ago. i had a pretty good job as a land surveyor, made a good living, life was good. the rodman i had at the time, he had to quit due to health reasons, so i got a brand new helper. all was going ok until he decided to be a complete bitch. the job involved covering some pretty rough terrain, lot of swamps, chopping line in the florida summers, crapload of snakes out. great job for me, but for this guy, it was a reason to gripe and tell me just how much money he *should* be getting paid, you know the kind. well, after a particular clusterfuck of a job, we have to set a few property corners and get back to the shop. no....this guy is too good to stay half an hour later to actually finish a job, and proceeds to call his fiancee to come pick him up. by the time she got there to pick him up, i'd went and set the rods by myself. it rather pissed me off. well, the guy, being the pompous asshat he was, had given me his 'business card'...for a window tinting thing he did out of his garage...a few weeks earlier. he had also been complaining that his neighbors were gay. wheels began to turn in my head, and i had a nice little 'fuck you' plan in no time. after work, i went over to lillian alabama, where the porn shops are, and found a nice guy-on-guy mag, and asked the cashier for a subscription form for it. on the way home, i stopped in a circle k and got a money order for one year's worth of the mag. with his address from the card, and a nighttime drive-by i got his neighbor's address. i filled it out in his name to his neighbor's address and mailed it in. about a month later, he come in to work looking like someone had just kicked his puppy. boss asked him what was wrong, and even i was not expecting the reply. "my fiancee called it off. she thinks i'm gay." my plan worked a bit too well. the neighbors got the mags in his name, and went over to give them to him, but she was the one they gave em to. she opened the black plastic, and the shit hit the fan. i was biting the inside of my lips till they bled to keep from laughing, because this big cornfed country boy would have killed me if he knew i was the reason the love of his life walked out and left him. tl:dr sent gay porn to a coworkers neighbor and caused his fiancee to leave him. okay technically this wasn't me and more my brother. little bit of backstory: i graduated high school almost a year ago and of course was going to need a part time job to cover my needs and whatever i'll need for college. my brother, who manages a pizza franchise store and supervises a couple stores owned by his boss, told me he can hook me up with a job, but at a corporate store of the same company (he knew the manager.) but i wanted to work at a retail instead of a restaurant so i turned his offer down. i tried applying to jobs for about 2 months but no place hired me simply because i was 17 at the time. with college going to start in a couple of weeks i was desperate and bit the bullet and asked my brother if he can still get me the job. long story short i got it. i liked working for the store that hired me. i would usually cut and roll the dough that they use for the pizzas. i loved cutting and rolling dough. when i would cut with other crew members we would always tell each other crazy stories and shit, and we would always have a great time. after 2 months of cutting and rolling i was just as fast as the people who taught me. we would always challenge each other, and sometime we would also get the manager involved with our fuckery and he would join us. but the problem was it was a bit far away. it takes around a 15 minute drive to get to the store from my house. (sounds like a terrible excuse when some people drive up to an hour to get the their job, but this is part time people.) although i enjoyed that store i felt like the drive wasn't worth it, because there were 3 different other stores that were closer to my house. so i talked to my manager and asked for a transfer to the closest store and i got it. people were sad i was leaving and i was sad i was leaving. it was a great store. but on the bright side i only had waste 5 minutes worth of gas instead of 15. this is the part that just made me angry. at first the new store i was digging. the people seemed nicer. i was getting the usual same amount of hours as the last store, i came in 3 days a week, and work the 3 hours i was scheduled. (sometimes you would stay more if they needed you, and usually they did.) but i started getting screwed about after a month being there. the schedule was being made by the co-managers. there's 2. one is one of the funniest mother fuckers i've ever met. we cut and rolled dough once together and it was fucking hilarious. he used things that weren't meant to cut dough to cut dough. he got a pizza ring that's used mainly as a template for saucing and cheesing pizza sheet outs and went to fucking town. he then got the blade from the dough mixer then started using that shit as fast as he could. he used so a lot of things to cut dough that he really shouldn't be using to cut dough, it was great. he even used a fucking lid of a bin. but the other co-manager? she's garbage. and she was out to get me. the good co needed time off for unknown reasons and all the duties of the co-managers was left to the co-manager that hated my guts. when we would do dough it was dead silent. i couldn't spark a small conversation no matter how hard i tried. the only time i ever talked to her was when i introduced myself. and as it turns out she's the sister-in-law of the manager who hired me. she would only talk to one crew member, and the managers only. (assistants, co's, and actual manager). she is known to send people home early. like really early. she has sent me home after only 2 hours of working. she would send me home right after i finished the dough, instead of teaching me or training me in something else. if she felt like i was going to take more than 2 hours to finish she would send someone to help me so she can send my ass home right after my 2 hours, so i couldn't just take my time. she was the sole person left in charge of arranging the schedule. and apparently her first decision was to only give me 2 days for the entire week. i didn't mind because i was scheduled for 4 hours those days meaning i was going to only lose 1 hour of work that week. but i remembered who she was. i knew i was only going to work for 4 hours the entire week. and i did. luckily i was only scheduled for 2 days that one week. although every week after that i was getting 3 days a week i was still only getting 6 hours work weekly, while in the other store i was getting up to 17. so i called my brother asking him what i should do concerning my co-manager problem. he just told me to talk to the manager. so i did, and she had a word with the co. and what does she do? she schedules me on tuesday, saturday, and sunday. managers have tuesdays and sundays off. tuesdays i can make, because i don't go to school tuesdays, and saturdays were the only days me and the manager go in on the same day, but i was put in closing crew meaning i would get there an hour after the manager has already left. so my complaint only bought me one more hour of work. i couldn't complain to the manager anymore because i would never see her anymore. so i then call up my brother again with the bullshit i'm going through. my brother again suggested the obvious of me going to the store when the manager is there and talk to her again, even if i don't work that day. i then told him about her and my old manager being brothers-in-law. (my old manager knows my brother in case you forgot) and my brother showed his love for me in the greatest of ways. he calls up the manager who hired me and asks if there's any co-managers that could use a better pay check, and that one of the stores, that's only 2 cities away, he supervises needs a co-manager asap. apparently my brothers boss pays his employees a bit more than the corporate stores. so my old manager talked to his terrible sister-in-law, whom i hate btw, about the offer. and after about 2 weeks of her telling the entire store that she's thinking about going to the franchise store she agrees and leaves my store, and goes to the franchise. that's not it my friends. when you transfer from a corporate to a franchise store, you basically have to quit the corporate job then get rehired at the franchise. so she basically quit her job at my store. but it doesn't end there; apparently my brothers boss was thinking on closing and relocating that store because it wasn't earning enough money, and she had no idea. not even the manager of the franchise store had any idea. she was happily working, and earning more money for about 3 months until the store owner decided to bite the bullet and relocated the store. where was he relocating the store to? detroit michigan. we live in california. she was offered the chance to keep her job, but she would have to relocate half-way cross the country, which she refused and got fired. she tried getting her job back at my store and failed. i'm not sure if it was because i spilled a lot of beans on how badly she did her job (which are a lot btw, but this is long enough already.) or if the manager realized that they can do their the job with just one co-manager. she complained to my old manager, who complained to my brother, and he claimed he didn't know that was gonna happen, knowing dawn well it was. i'm not sure what happened to her after that. but i'd like to imagine her getting a shit job, or having to start all over again at the bottom. i didn't know that any of this was going down until i told my brother that she left the store for another one, then he told me. i love you brother. edit: wording edit 2: forgot to put the first edit. edit 3: i understand that what i wrote in the description doesn't make her seem like she deserves it. but i have replied to a comment with more reasons on how bad she was.throwaway, just in case.... a while back, i worked at a pretty large tech company with several branches across the country. at one point, my team had this manager, player. he was an idiot who did not understand any of the technology we supported. he also sucked at managing, any issue was immediately passed to his supervisor to handle. player's boss had requested weekly updates. his peer in our other location would type up summaries of what his techs were working on, projects and the like. player got cc:ed on them, then directly copy/pasted them and would present the same weekly report to the *same* boss! (i mean *really?!?!* did he really think this would fly? what a maroon...) player also hired his incompetent friends. anyway, player had 2 kids by 2 different baby mamas, wasn't married to either of them (this was over 10 years ago and raised a few eyebrows in a corporate environment). we had three females on our team and he situated them in cubicles directly around his cube. player surrounded himself with the female techs like a harem and would joke about it. one of the female techs, newbie, came over from the customer service department and did not feel very secure in her new position, being new and not very technical. newbie was young and very attractive. she lived with her boyfriend pretty far away so she had a long commute to work. player would instant message her frequently saying really smarmy stuff and constantly asking her to stay the night at his place, since her commute was so bad. newbie felt pressured and told me what was happening, showing me the ims. i advised her to go to hr but she refused to do so, she didn't want to rock the boat. we had gone through sexual harassment training, so i knew that i could complain to hr even if the harassment was happening to someone else, but i did not do so at the time as that isn't what newbie wanted. i suffered under this moron's micromanagement for a long time. complaints to the big boss went nowhere because in a large company it is sometimes difficult to get rid of a manager. one day though, player went too far. a gal in a different department came back from maternity leave and was showing off her baby pictures to coworkers. player made a joke "the baby really looks like me, huh?", implying that he was the baby daddy (he was not). oh boy. you bet your ass i complained to hr. i mean really, it was just a matter of time before someone would sue the company because of his actions. shortly after, the big boss announced that player's position had been eliminated. several months after that, i heard that player had a had time finding a job but was now a store manager in retail (quite a step down from his previous position). i'm pretty sure he never worked in tech again, as he has no linkedin profile. justice is sweet. i hope he learned his lesson but jerks like him usually don't. the end.years ago i worked in the guest services office for a large hotel company. we handled everything from basic reservations to "i sent my kids into the room first and there was a couple in there already, and now i have to explain to my kids what a blow job is!" but that's a story for another time. a little over half of our properties were franchises, which means that in exchange for the prestige of our name and our global booking system, you had to operate according to several strict rules... a whole book of them, in fact. in our office we enforced the rules, and if your franchise didn't meet muster we could refund your guests' costs and bill you for it. goodbye revenue, hello meeting with standards enforcement. because our end of the operation was given a lot of power to resolve guest complaints, our office's practices are also written into the franchise agreement. therefore, we had extensive classroom training, as well as hands on training once the classroom was finished. we required that anyone who contacted us received a letter to confirm the resolution of the letter, and letter writing was therefore a skill we tested for in the interview process. not that it mattered all that much, because we had form letters for most contingencies, and you could edit them to fit the specifics of a given situation. also, most of our busy season hires were college kids working a summer job and to make money for school. of course, every job gets a few rotten apples. one of ours was a special case who i will call deeds. deeds had a classic case of "mine excrement doth not have an odour," coupled with the best example of the dunning-kruger effect i have ever seen firsthand in my life. because i was a senior representative in the department with proven writing skills, i would get to proofread the letters that the newbies were sending out. if approved they could be sent, if not corrections would be written in purple ink, and returned to the employees inbox. deeds never got off the proofreading list, but it was noticed we was closing out his cases with a letter anyway, boy with the added benefit of not faxing the resolution to the hotel gm\owner. one of these made its way to the ceo, and that is when the shit hit the fan for deeds. the letter that had him on the carpet said "dear customer, its you're own fault that you didn't understand how hotels work. sincerely, deeds" this was sent to one of our loyalty program customers, who spent over 300 nights a year in hotels. not your everyday stupid on mr. deeds. after begging for his job with the department manager and hr manager, he was placed on an instant final warning and probation for six months. i got the fortunate job of being his mentor. i had to sign off on everything he did before he could do it. effectively, this had me doing two jobs. the joys of being a responsible employee, am i right? eventually, he seemed to straighten up and his parole ended. immediately, he started to fuck things up, though. at this point he had switched to a night shift, so i never saw him, but i was kept in the loop on his misdeeds, because he was my broken toy for so long. almost every day he would bully a night desk clerk into breaking the rules because he didn't want to explain the rules to a whiny customer, or he would unilaterally decide to refund money for something we didn't cover. like a $100 check because the poor guest had to wait in long lines at disneyland during halloween, or making the front desk pay to order a dozen pizzas because the hotels outdoor pool was closed on christmas. those of us on the day shift would get angry calls from general managers and owners, and we would have to arrange to get billed for these outrageous expenses. needless to say, this ate into our meager budget for non-billable goodwill payments, and management was pissed. the department manager stayed late one night, read him the riot act, and told him he had to stay strictly within guidelines; if it wasn't in the franchise agreement book, and he couldn't get the poor sap at the hotel to read the required action on page xx, then he couldn't do it. last chance, next mistake and you're out, buddy! deeds realized we all hated him, and started looking for greener pastures. he thought we were friends, because of my six months of hell trying to get him to follow the rules, so he came to me for advice on how to interview for a management position at a hotel. hotels loved hiring from our office, because we knew the rule book inside out, and were so jaded by strange customers that nothing fazed us. i saw an opportunity, and have him every to my fevered brain could devise to get him gone, gone, gone. he shortly got a job at a hotel in florida, have his notice, and spent his days bragging about how when he was at the hotel he would be calling us suckers all he time to make us do his work for him. he was so proud that he was going to get to live on site for up to a year so he could save on rent, too. he basically stopped doing the job we were paying him for, but instead of discipline we all decided it was better to let him slack than make someone else fix his mistakes. soon, he was gone, and an exception was made to give him employee discount cards from our stock so he could stay at a couple of hotels on his drive from sally lake city to florida. on his first night as a guest at a hotel, he tried get the desk clerk to upgrade him to a bridal suite, but fucked up two ways. first, he demanded it instead of politely asking for it, and second, it was the gm filling in for his night auditor who was sick. the gm called to verify employment, and one of the night supervisors have him the run down on mr. deeds, then had him hand the phone over to deeds and told him in no uncertain terms to be a good little boy, go to his room, not bother the staff, and check out early. the gm was on board with this, so the rest of the night was uneventful. the next night, deeds pulled the exact same shit at the next hotel, again the gm was filling in, but he wasn't as easy going as the first time. he called, angry as a horny sailor fresh from a tour aboard a submarine who just found out that a vengeful wizard has turned every hooker's vagina in new york during fleet week into a buzzing hornet's nest just when young midshipman sonofabitch snaps the condom into place on his throbbing flesh torpodo. livid, i mean, our good gm was. he demanded deeds be fired for bullying him and his desk clerk, and when told he only had the employee discount card so we could get rid of him, h he demanded we take action. we assured him that the appropriate steps would be taken. we will call the night supervisor steve. steve left a massive email and supporting faxed statements from both hotels' managers for our manager, who i will call jamie. jamie called both hotels early the next morning, having read the email about 3 am when she got up to take some meds for her multiple sclerosis. she was in the office two hours before we opened so she could call both hotels and discuss things with the managers. then, when the rest of us arrived, she has every employee on staff that morning take some time and write up every bad experience we had ever had with dumb ol' deeds. the she faxed it all to the owner of the hotel where he had just got a new job, called the desk to see when the owner would be in, took a nap until said time, then called the owner back to outline the situation, and suggest they call the other two hotels for first hand discussions before making a decision. when deeds rolled up in the u-haul, the owner was waiting with two security guards, a restraining order barring him from the property (her uncle was a judge, and did a favor for family), a pile of documentation about his terrible behavior, and a notified letter rescinding his offer of employment. so, here was deeds, two thousand miles from and friends or family with no job, no home, and no sympathy. tl;dr even caesar didn't have as many people sticking so many knives in his back so you could tell if he was man or porcupine. edit: appellate to appropriate i thought this subreddit might enjoy my tale of long-term revenge, though reading other posts of the past couple of months i feel i may be far out of my league here. nonetheless, may you find some gratification in my revenge... **it started some years ago.** the culprit (culprit) was a middle-aged c-level exec at my company. when i started working there i was informed that culprit had some kind of grudge against the department i worked in; not because he was wronged, but something he carried with him from his previous job. even without the warning, culprit did a fine job of making it clear he was a douchebag. he had no experience either at the executive level or his department's function (a customer-oriented function, ironically, and i found he'd falsified his resume), and his actions made it very clear. he mismanaged his staff to such an extent the company lost $500k in just one instance - and he manipulated this to get a $30k bonus. culprit was also the one-upper - if you told him your spaceship cost $24 billion, he'd say his cost four solar systems and an ocean of kitten blood. this is important. at every turn, culprit blamed my department for his own shortcomings. he turned his staff against my department (and in a sadistic twist of fate, this legacy is directly responsible for much of the company's current failure - but that's another story) and in *every single interaction* with my department, culprit found a way to be condescending, manipulative, irritating, and a roadblock to success. as an example, i scheduled a meeting with culprit, two other c-levels, and knowledgeable guy in culprit's department to discuss how to eliminate a massive problem his staff was creating - massive as in causing the company to miss client appointments and pay out lots 'n' lots of money. culprit agreed to the meeting time, but canceled *literally* two minutes before - leaving the other c-levels and i hanging out in the conference room, which was perhaps 20 feet from culprit's office. when the c-level's confronted him (by walking the 20 feet), he said he was busy with "stuff". my blood is boiling even now. to avoid a heart explosion in front of my computer, please simply trust me on this: culprit is a grade aaa, twice-boiled, rockstar-level, asshole-pounding, shit-eating douchebag. and his main target was my cohorts and me. **fast-forward to quite some time later.** by this point my entire department had left the company, it was starting to tank, and culprit had been laid off with a bunch of other people. i was hanging out with my old boss and coworkers when someone mentioned culprit. talk went from his douchebaggery to his new job to, eventually, how delicious it would be to exact some long-term, subtle vengeance. and, dear reader, this is how the website was born. **the revenge** of idle curiosity, i checked to see if www.culpritsfirstandlastname.com had been registered. good golly, it wasn't. this i interpreted as a sign from on high - and you know what happens when those are ignored (whale intestines, for those who don't). of course i immediately purchased the domain name, paying for the next 10 years in a lump sum. definitely worth it. then i installed a crappy website framework and threw up a basic blog, about page, and forum. all of these were liberally sprinkled with references to "culpritsfirstandlastname &lt;socially-frowned-upon sexual proclivity&gt;" - which was, in fact, both the site's title and the theme of the site itself. i wrote blog posts that mirrored culprit's writing/grammar/punctuation and adhered to his self-professed level of technical skill. i seeded the forums with graphic conversations about socially-frowned-upon sexual proclivity. i set up the home page so it displayed the top 20 explicit pictures from a google image search for socially-frowned-upon sexual proclivity. i littered culpritsfirstandlastname &lt;socially-frowned-upon sexual proclivity&gt; about the site like bird droppings at a seagull festival. **then it went a step further.** after setting up the domain registration to change to a different company every three days, i started searching for culprit's name on the internet. try searching for your own name; you'll probably get a bunch of spammy results from spokeo, whitepages, etc. who knew that **anyone** can claim and edit those listings? so i claimed every listing i could find and set www.culpritsfirstandlastname.com as the home page url using different throwaway email addresses. i even created profiles for culprit on a few of the sites that didn't already have him and linked to culprit's new website. i can only imagine people casually googling culprit's name, clicking the seemingly innocent www.culpritsfirstandlastname.com link, and running, horrified, from the explicit pictures that show up on the home page. it helps me sleep at night. every once in a while i google culprit's first and last name. often www.culpritsfirstandlastname.com comes up as the first or second result. sometimes it's buried on the second page. every time, though, i get warm fuzzies thinking about how permanent online information is, and how hard it is to remove something from the internet. good luck, culprit, getting anyone to take you seriously again. *tl;dr: why did you click?*so back when i was 14 i played ball in an all-star summer league. i play catcher so i called all the pitches by the normal routine of putting fingers down to distinguish which pitch i wanted thrown. anyways were playing a game against a good team and its pretty close. however there was this one big mongoloid on the other team who would always look back at my signs while he was in the batters box to steal what pitch was coming. every time he did it i told him to stop being a pussy and just play the game. he did not adhere. so after he got two base hits i was pretty fed up so i told my teammates. my one teammate kevin came up with the idea to flip him off the next time he looked. i thought this was a great idea. in comes the troll into the batters box and without a doubt he starts to steal my signs again. after the first pitch, i called time and met with the pitcher on the mound and told him that i was going to flip this kid off and to then throw at his head. he was down with the get down. so i assume my position and see the kid peering into my crotch again for the signs. i flip him the ol' bird and start laughing. the kid then exits the box and starts throwing a hissy fit about how i "flipped him off." the umpire is confused and thinks the kid says i was flicking him with my hand, so he tells me to cut that out. i keep laughing but the kid is still aggravated. the ump then tells the kid to get into the box and play ball. he eventually does. the next pitch comes right at his head and he dodges out of the way. at this point my entire team knows whats going on, especially our large first baseman will. the kid is frazzled but continues to try and steal signs and **every time he looks i give him the middle finger.** the balls and strikes count gets to 2-2 and so i call for a curveball, no middle finger, and whisper to the kid that a curveball is coming and that i bet he couldnt hit it. well the curveball comes, hits the dirt and he swings and misses. we were playing regulation and since i didnt catch the ball cleanly, the kid could try to advance to first. he does exactly that, but remember this kid is not the fastest player. i calmly throw the ball to first base and he is out by a mile. our first baseman will catches the ball and stands directly on the bag, pretty much blocking the kids way. the kid, flustered, then tries to bulldoze will. will is huge and stuffs him with ease and the kid gets pummeled to the ground. the umpire comes over and ejects the kid out of the game. the kid starts crying and **im still laughing.** we won the game and i was a homerun away from the cycle. tl:dr fat kid tries to steal my pitching signs during baseball game. i give him the finger, get him aggravated, strike him out, and then get him tossed from the game. i went to a boarding school in rural australia which had a problem with the leading brothers abusing kids, a problem that went on for decades. the older of us would try to protect the younger, but there was only so much we could do. at the time the police were very closely tied with the school and turned a blind eye to all but the worst behaviour, and it took one hell of a lot of effort to even have that exposed. thankfully, through the long work of some of my schoolmates from the time the problems have come to light and reparations are being made. back in the 70s and 80s we were powerless kids, though. after i left school, one of the worst of the brothers was clearly still active. a few of us wanted revenge that'd hurt him. not too long after, we were informed of the dates he took for a choir tour, during the christmas break. at the beginning of that summer, we went and collected meat, milk, dog shit, and all manner of stinky items and broke into his car (he had this 1960s mercedes he was all too proud of), and placed it under the seats to ferment in the heat. a couple of days later we realised roadkill would do a great number on it, and we dropped the better part of a whole kangaroo in the back seat. and so it went on for another six weeks until he returned. foxes, roos, wallabies, possums, rabbits, birds of all kinds and a couple of tortoises, we stacked the inside of his merc with roadkill up to the dash. by the end we needed to mask ourselves to even approach the car, the stench was coming out the vents. our quarry returned, and we heard nothing of the car or the attack until a fortnight later when he disappeared. no information on where he went, where he moved to, what became of him until the 2000s when some of his deeds became public, and so many adults came out of the woodwork with the knowledge of support, and he stood no chance. last i heard he was still in gaol. for a while, i regretted what i helped do. i felt i should have done more, and instead of playing around behind the scenes doing the (somewhat heavy handed) passive aggressive thing, i should have worked hard to bring this man undone, speaking to others affected has made me realise none of us ever had the power to do that alone, and it was only after half a lifetime and a complete swing in the country's culture against respect for institutions like my old school, that it could successfully be exposed. now, i'm proud of the small part i played in making his life hell.my dad went to college at uw madison and would ride his bike between his classes. now as some of you may know in winter it gets very cold in madison, it's not uncommon for it to be 10-15 degrees below zero. on one of these freezing cold days my dad was biking to class wearing his heavy ski mask and mittens to protect him from the weather. as he rode down the street he saw ahead of him a man pulling out of his driveway in his car, this man saw my dad approaching on his bike as he was backing out, made full eye contact with him and then abruptly continued out into the street hitting my dad, knocking him off his bike and bending the frame. at this point my dad collected himself and upon seeing the man driving away hopped back onto his now bent bike and began to chase him. now i should mention my dad grew up in a fairly sketchy neighborhood in chicago and as a side-effect of being held up one to many times carried a folding buck knife in a holster on his side at all times. as he was chasing this man in his car my dad pulled off his mitten with his mouth, grabbed the knife and unfolded it. at this point the man driving the car looked in his rear view mirror and saw my dad in his tarrorist-esque ski mask holding a mitten in his mouth and a large buck knife in his hand rapidly approaching. his reaction was to speed up and run a red light at the next intersection at which point he was promptly t-boned by another car. as if this wasn't enough revenge a police car also happened to be waiting at the intersection and pulled up with their lights flashing to the car, at which point my dad folded his knife, removed his ski mask and rode by slowly smiling and waving. tl;dr my dad was riding his bike a guy in a car looked at him, then hit him, my dad chased him with a knife the dude then crashed his car and got arrested.just an update, i'm still owed my money, but my war isn't totally unsuccessful or over. for those who don't remember, my ex employer took me for about 10k. they converted back salary into shares based by convincing people based on deceitful assumptions and empty promises. i reported them to the cra for tax fraud, because they used sred tax credits incorrectly, essentially using research credits for private profits. i also reported them for every criminal act i could think of and contacted partners to inform them of how deceitful the company is. i have no information on the audit, if it's happening or the progress or outcome. i am not on the loop on that, but the cra did say they would be "randomly" audited shortly. however, given that i don't see the insides of the company i can't say much, i can however say that the big application i wrote for them is no longer in the wild. it appears i've help ensure that the company lost one of it's biggest contracts, and that alone should financially surpass any money they owe me. i ran into the ceo today, and sat down for a informal discussion. he claimed he can't pay me because then he'd have to pay everyone. very much a bullshit claim, and easily worked around. they could partially buy back shares from everyone and work towards being in the clear, but clearly their interest is to horde their money and continue being dishonest scumbags. i will be filing in small claims to reclaim my money, and will try and do another update then, but for now i'd like to at least say that i've done enough damage to the company that paying me would have been the easy solution. everything else is just cake from this point forward. either the audit will fuck them entirely and i'll possibly get my money back, but at least in fucking them i've been successful. the revenge component is done, now i'm just pursuing justice.ok, not sure if this is petty or pro.... i lost my job a couple years ago and had to move out of state. the owner of the apartments i moved to hired me to be the maintenance guy, i was the first repair man she had that wasn't hooked on meth. i agreed to lower than minimum wage, but it was under the table so i was sorta ok with it at the time. i worked my ass off, she would give me one to two days to turn apartments over. i laid carpet, linoleum, paint you name it i did it. i cleaned the grossest places in the world. fast forward 2 years...i was needing some money to renew my id so i asked for a check (most of the time i just applied my wages to the rent) she shut me down and said she didn't have the money, i wasn't able to get my id so i wasn't able to take another job. i was stuck being her slave, that summer i had a apartment that needed to have all new everything, even toilet. the place was a mess. she had another renter help out but his gf went into labor that night so he wasn't able to help....problem was she never adjusted for his absence and called for a inspection for 3 days after i started...i half killed myself to finish in time, the night of the second day i hurt my back trying to lay carpet by myself...my back hurt really bad, so bad it was hard to walk. she was informed that i was injured but didn't seem to believe me, she was only worried about the inspection. i beasted out as much as i could and finished in time to pass. my back was hurt so bad i was laid out for a solid month, crazy pain. i've never felt that type of pain before... two weeks in she bought a bunch of bark dust and plants for the yard. i was doing the best i could but it was hard to even walk but i was getting it done. she noticed i wasn't working as fast as she wanted and decided to give me a lesson on how to use a shovel ( like i don't know) it really started to make my blood boil but i tried to keep my mouth shut, but she wasn't done...she went on to give me a speech about how she needed the "biggest bang" for her buck. wrong thing for her to say considering i'm the first guy to not rob her blind and i wasn't even getting min wage and could even get a check when i needed it most...i lost it, threw the tools down and walked of. fast forward a week, i decided it was time to move. i found a better job and was getting ready to move... i still couldn't forget the "biggest bang" speech, just couldn't let it go....sooooo i took weed killer to all the bushes she just bought and drilled small holes in all 14 metal roofs! tl:dr don't forget to get the biggest bang for your buckso this isn't quite the normal revenge story, as it all happened in a video game, specifically, eve online, a spaceship mmo. now for those that don't know it, eve online is to hardcore gamers what hardcore gamers are to regular people. it's the most insane of the insane. shit happens in eve that doesn't happen anywhere else. ccp, the developers, basically have no rules in playing (some very basic don't abuse bugs - scamming, stealing, etc. is all fair game). it's also slightly complicated: . there is something called "plex", which can be bought for ~$20 real money, and sold in-game. it grants additional playtime, and is a way to estimate in-game money to real money. enter me. bored, depressed, looking for something to do. i decided to try "yet another mmo", and see how it went. i joined one of the newbie organizations, and it was miserable. i learned, but they were very restrictive. so i jumped ship to an alliance in nullsec (high risk, high reward space), and part of one of the larger coalitions at the time. (members -&gt; corporations -&gt; alliances -&gt; coalitions). there were fewer rules, and it was more freeing and fun to play. i quite enjoyed myself for a time, but there was something i couldn't shake off. the other members of the coalition. they were toxic, they belittled and berated everyone for trying to do anything, for trying to help, for trying to make things better. anyone did something, and it was met with a chorus of jeers. i liked the alliance, the coalition, but i couldn't stand the members. they'd go so far as to even occasionally scam each other, and i got hit by this once. most questions i had, or mistakes i made, were met with a torrent of abuse. i quickly grew to hate the individuals. but i couldn't jump ship again. i was a marked man, having been in this alliance. i decided on revenge instead. having a large amount of time on my hands, i discovered something that i could do as a relatively newish player that most players didn't like doing that i enjoyed, and with all my time, i was able to do it a bunch, leading to some minor appreciation of my work among the very few people who tried to keep the whole mess running. (again, to choruses of jeers). i earned a slight reputation, and constant posting on the forums made me a known person. so i started an investment, doing all of the math, showing people how it was a good idea, and asking for a modest but not outrageous amount of money. i managed to get it, and slowly paid it back over months time. (for reference, this tale encompasses almost 9 months). i continued my activities, and slowly got promoted through the ranks. i dipped and dabbled here and there, always polite, always helpful. slowly my access grew, and i was eventually invited to an inner money-making scheme, where we trusted each other with good chunks of our money for all of us to make much more. now, with such a large group, owning large amounts of rich money-making space, with such toxic people, how were we not invaded and kicked out of our space? how did we get it in the first place? we had a "big brother" (bb) who intially helped us get this space, and it was well-known that anyone who messed with us was also messing with bb. this kept us safe except for skirmishes, and people were willing to show up for skirmishes they knew we'd win. time goes by. my activities lead me to being essentially inner circle (but not quite - the inner circle would decide things, then task me and only me to do them), and i became de-facto head of intelligence for this very large (~8000 members) coalition. and i still hated their guts. and i still bided my time. i paid off the investment in full - smaller amounts than this had been scams, and by this point i was fully trusted. around this point bb decided they had enough of us, that we didn't deserve our space, and that they were evicting us. my plan crystallized (i knew i wanted to deal massive amounts of damage, but this gave me the chance to do even more), and i promptly messaged the head of bb, explaining who i was, what my plan was, and would they like some help. i was granted with doubt ("this has never worked before" "everyone who's ever offered to turn coats has been a plant"), and they, suspciously, asked me what i wanted in return for my services. i told them i wanted nothing, i just hated the coalition with a deep, burning passion, and wanted to see them burn. i had been mentioning a plan for a super-large scale investment and money making opportunity for awhile now, and immediately put it into effect. to make it look legitimate i had set the entire thing up as if it would actually happen, giving so many layers to the deception that no amount of investigating would reveal any inconsistencies. i asked for an outrageous amount, and due to my previous activities and reputation, i got it and more. the stage was set. the invasion began, and as head of intelligence, i was in charge of making all of our intelligence spreadsheets (google docs were used, i made them all, handled the access and permissions, and they were the only source of a large amount of our intelligence), and i coordinated scouts during battles. while in the command channels, to better relay the intel. while streaming the command channels to bb's commanders, so they had perfect intel of what we were thinking, and what we were going to do. while gaining war-time access to most of the command forums. i know at least two alliance fleets died without a fight due to the intel streamed. i suspect many more fleets got killed as a result. at last, the moment was ripe. i had gotten the massive investment, i had access to various alliance assets, i was still in the money-making group that gave each other assets, and i was the owner of the intel documents. i stole it all, then proceeded to wipe all access to the intel documents. i got away with so much stuff that i literally couldn't count how much i had managed to get. i copied the command forums. i finished it off with a taunting message to everyone in the coalition. bb shortly won the war, (and the alliance shortly fell apart) and offered me a spot. i happily accepted, and they're a much nicer bunch of people internally. (they're not nice to outsiders) i've been pretty happy ever since, my life's turned around, and all in all, operation successful. be nice to your teammates. you never know what they can do. tl;dr: the people i was playing with were mean. i helped burn their empire to the ground, and stole everything not nailed down. edit: i forgot to mention the final loot tally. it took me a few weeks to sell, scrap or donate (i gave stuff to some of the actually nice people/someone who lost everything and would be quitting otherwise/and literally everyone who asked me for some), and still ended up with ~150 billion isk in loot. a plex at the time sold for ~500m isk. remember, a plex costs almost $20. edit 2: forgot to mention, i got to the point where i had the alliance paying for my membership. edit 3: since i was asked, i realized i didn't post the value of a fleet. fleets in eve for warfare of the type we were engaged in are fought primarily by battleships, with a well-equipped one cost around 300m. then there are a huge number of support ships, usually costing less (capitals cost a ton more, but i won't get into them), to the point where a fleet could well be half-battleships, half-support. for the sake of numbers let's say the average ship cost 200m. fleet cap out at 255 people, but often multiple fleets are created to form one large fleet... confusingly still called a fleet. from here on out i'll just reference the one large fleet. so i got two of them blown up, at around 300-400 people each time, with ships costing something like 200m per person. if anyone who has a higher understanding of fleet comps and costs wants to help edit these numbers, i'd be glad to take it.right, i know backstory is boring so i'll make it brief. i have a fairly serious speech impediment. it's gotten better as i've grown and developed confidence, but it still gets me at really awkward moments. as a result, i am fairly quiet and hang out with a small, tight-knit group of friends. at the time of this incident, i was 14 years old and in reasonable physical shape. i am in the new zealand cadet corps, so i'm an experienced camper and enjoy being in the outdoors. at the end of year 10 (grade 9 in the us), everyone in my year/grade went on a three-day hike. we were meant to travel 15-20km each day, so fairly challenging. now, it is at this point in my story that the antagonist shows his ugly face. i'll call him blimp, because that's what he was shaped like. he was fat, nearly obese. he constantly mocked me and my speech difficulty. as luck would have it, we ended up in the same tramping group. the first day of the tramp began fine. blimp ate two days worth of food, supplementing himself with candy he'd brought from home. because of his weight, he slowed down the group and by the end of the day, we'd only gone 10km. at the end of the day, i lay in my sleeping bag and the beginnings of an idea crept into my mind. on the morning of the second day, i suggested to our instructor that we increase the pace. he was reluctant at first, but i reminded him that we only had two days left, and we had to travel almost 50km, so he consented. we set off at a cracking pace. since everyone in the group was reasonably fit, all of us could easily keep going. all of us, that is, except for blimp. you can probably guess what happens next: blimp was forced to run in order to keep up, and by lunchtime he was sobbing in pain, shame, and fear of being left behind. **edit: realised i need a tl:dr, so here it is: fat bullying shithead is shamed on a forced march.**i'm going to share my story of a girl that changed my life. originally, it was in a good way, but then it got bad. then worse. then kinda good. then really bad and soul-crushing. so, here's how it begins: in the summer after my freshman year of college, i met this girl (25) who was older than me (19), but she and i had a lot of mutual interests, especially the games we played, so we started talking. she always seemed like the hard exterior type, and i assumed that she had no interest in me. but then we started talking more and more, and i realized she was definitely attracted to me. she told me about her divorce, how he beat her and cheated on her, and my heart just melted. she was such a good person, and no one deserves that kind of treatment. even after this whole ordeal, i still would never wish that upon her, because that's fucking demoralizing and awful. we started to get closer as we talked about our pasts, our interests, etc. we connected a lot. it had been ~6 months since the divorce and she was just starting to feel good again, and knowing that i was a part of that made me happy to help her. soon enough, we realized we had true feelings for each other, and wanted to pursue something more than just friendship. so, we did. now, here's one thing that i'm going to be honest about. this was my first serious relationship. in my past, i have been with girls, and only said yes to the bf/gf label because they wanted to. i was just looking for some fun, but i was fine with moving forward if it meant that we could still have fun. ironically, i'd actually start to get feelings, and then the relationship would wind up ending. so, naturally, i had my walls up, and decided to just start playing it safe. and then i met this girl. for once, it didn't start physical, it started emotional. i was getting feelings, and then i started getting physical. it felt like things were going right. hell. fucking. no. let's call this girl bitch. so, bitch and i started off amazingly well. we'd have phone convos at night that ended with us falling asleep together, we'd have skype dates, and we'd game together. it was getting awesome, and i felt so close to her, but now here's where i should mention one thing: we never made our relationship public. she wanted to keep it low-key, since she was "still getting over her divorce." well after the breakup, i realized that she was ashamed of me, and i'm guessing it had to do with the age difference. the funny thing is, she and i talked about meeting each other's parents a lot, and how it would be awesome for each of us, given our personalities. she meant so much to me, and i would talk her through all the panic attacks she'd have, and try to be the best guy to her. i fucked up in my previous relationships, but this time, i refused. i wanted to be the good guy. the sweet guy. the great boyfriend. hell, i remember one time she posted one of those pictures with the quote "a good guy wakes you up at 3am to tell you he loves you" and had the "he loves you" crossed out and above it saying "with cookies and ice cream." so, for our three month anniversary, i sent her a box of oreo cookies and a gift card to cold stone, and she was so happy and whatnot about it. okay, enough of this sappy shit. it's time to get to the bad parts. first of all, around five months into the relationship, she just stopped talking to me. i got really confused, but assumed that she needed her space. i would still reach out every now and then. then, on thanksgiving, she tells me that she was relapsing with memories from her ex-husband, and i understood and told her that we'd take a break. the day after new year's, she called me crying, saying how she wanted me in her life, and how she loves me, so naturally, i felt great again and said yes. 1-2 months into this new relationship, and i started realizing that one of the guys that used to game with us (we played gw, gw2, wow, etc., for proper context) would always be extra raunchy with her. and she would giggle about it and be the same way back. naturally, i wouldn't say "hey, fuck off talking to my girl like that," because we still hadn't made our relationship public yet. i would talk to her about it in private, and she told me that he was just like a brother to her and that's all. i had some apprehension because i've been in fucked up situations in my past with cheating, but i trusted her. so, i'd tolerate everything that happened, and just took it on the chin. another 3 months later, she broke up with me. i was planning on studying abroad at that point, so her breaking up with me definitely set me off on a "fuck this shit" note, and i left for london with a downtrodden state of mind. i hated the world, and didn't give a shit about anyone. once i started deciding to work out, i made friends with other guys who made it their summer goal to help me through this by showing me the proper techniques for the exercises i was doing, and even helped me gain my confidence back through this. i started meeting girls, even had some fun throughout this, and things were going well. i was finally starting to wake up in the mornings in a neutral state, rather than "fuck the world." but then, i found out. turns out that bitch fucked that "brother" friend of hers and less than a week after i left, he actually drove down to where she lived to spend quite a lot of time with her. i hear from him directly how this had been going on for quite some time, and that he was having a great time with her (he saw me as a friend, and had no idea of my relationship with bitch. i hope.). so now, i was back to fuck everything. my friends at the gym still helped me, but this time, i was lost. i was empty. i was worthless. i thought that i was never meant to have a serious relationship. i thought this was all for nothing. and then, i get a call closer to the end of the summer. i had been working while studying abroad, and had been making quite a bit of money doing it. it was helping me to know that while learning a lot, i was saving a lot too. i had talked to her well before our breakup, when we were talking about the possibility of moving in, and i said how i'd wanted to save up during the summer anyways, so at least it's for something meaningful. she was living with a relative, so she was excited at the thought of us living together. so, this call was from her, telling me how her house wound up getting burned down from some electrical issue (i think i loose wire or something?), and she was upset and didn't know what to do. she even told me how her dog died (that dog was adorable and amazing, i actually felt bad for her because she was a good girl). i was just shocked. i wanted to feel terrible for her, but i was just... not. the caring part of me wanted to help her. but after all of this crap, with her cheating and talking to this guy while taking gifts from me, and ignoring me (oh, one thing i should mention. my grandfather died during our relationship, and she didn't really console me. like, all she did was tell me how it was much worse for her when her grandfather died and start crying and get me to console her.) whenever i truly needed her, and oh, she never fucking told any of her friends or family about me, i just couldn't bring myself to care. i wanted to show that i was truly fucking done with her, and that after all that she's done to me, she doesn't deserve any of my love and caring. she asked me if i could help in any way to send money to her in order to help her out. when i told her, i'd think about it, she said that if possible, a check would be best and that she'd really appreciate it. that's when i realized what i could do. i wanted to be slightly subtle, vindictive, and spiteful all at the same time. while i definitely loved her dog, i know that bitch loved her dog so much more. so, i asked her for her address, and told her i'd send a check. she said thank you, and then said she had to go and hung up. yes, exactly like that. she didn't even say bye, she literally said "i have to go now, thank you" and hung the fuck up. so, i sent her a huge package of dog food with an attached note saying "i'm sorry for your loss." i blocked her on my phone, facebook, and steam after that. tl;dr bitch cheated on me for the majority of our relationship, tried to get me to help pay for her burned down home well after breaking up with me and me finding out about the cheating, so i bought her food for the charred remains of her dead dog.so, a few years back my brother-in-law (bil) (young guy in his early 30's) was diagnosed with cancer. our family is (was) pretty close, and everyone took it fairly hard. at the time i also happened to be looking for a new place to live. well, my bil and sister have a few rental properties and were looking at buying another one. they asked if i would be willing to rent it if they did. being a single female in my early 20's i stressed to them i probably couldn't afford it, but if it was in my price range of course i would, but i also asked them if they should really be focusing on that right now (maybe you should take care of bil's cancer and worry about your real estate when he's better...) anyways, you can't tell them what to do at all and they bought a house anyways. well, they told me i could rent the basement suite for less then my max price because they know i'll take care of it. i agree and we go about things. well, as i'm moving in they bring me a lease contract to sign, but the rent is over $200 more than what i had told them my max price was. i question them about it (with my crap half moved in, naturally), and they kind of bullshited me by saying things like 'oh we thought it would be okay' and 'i guess we forgot to factor in a, b and c.'. "okayyyyy" i think to myself, but arguing with your bil that has cancer is extremely difficult, so i reluctantly sign (and accept my lack of social life due to my inflated rent). fast forward to last year; my bil is getting significantly worse and given under 3 months to live. i made the trip to the hospital 1.5 hours away several times (as much as i could afford and often caught rides up there as well), and he looked bad. as in, i didn't think he'd make it another month bad. in canada (where we live), health care only does so much, and basically told him there was nothing left they could do for him. well, i did some research and found a specialized cancer treatment center in the states that gave him a shot at beating it. i asked my sister to make a few calls (knowing more than i did about his specific situation) and see if they pull take him. she told me they would, but it was far to expensive. i asked how much and she said 'about 75 000'. i immediately got together with friends and family about starting to raise some money (i had also found out the they didn't have life insurance with 2 small children and they would lose everything when bil died, essentially they were right fucked). now, i'm not the type of person to hold events, or generally just be social at all. i actually have mild social anxiety and dropped out of college because of it, but i somehow managed to rally together the entire community. a friend started them a go-fund-me page and gave my sister control (my sister also started a second one on youcaring). i found a place that would give us 200 seats (free) in a bar for a fundraiser in which we could sell ticket to. unfortunately it was around christmas time and the only date they had available was a last minute cancellation.... about a week and a half away. now i don't know if any of you have thrown any type of event, but that's not enough time to organize crap like that. somehow (and don't ask me how because it was such a blur and i don't think i slept at all) i managed to organize hundreds of people, find a band, sell all of our tickets, collect auction donations, create games/raffles/etc to bring in more money, get several large corporations to donate money/time/advertising, find decorations, create a slideshow, and get a ton of personal donations (over 5000 dollars) to be presented to the family because they were going through a tough time... all while working a full time job. while planning, i became extremely concerned with the legalities and expressed that in depth to my team. all auction items must be watched at all times, all money must be tracked, all paperwork copied and account for, etc. i also told my sister to not worry about a thing, just worry about taking care of bil. while, she not only 'helped' by completely 'forgetting' to do everything she insisted on doing, but talking down to me and ignoring all of the important things i was trying to express (she was actually a huge bitch the entire time). i tried to shake it off assuming she was just stressed. a few days before the fundraiser i tried to get the treatment center info from my sister for my speech, but she kept blowing me off so i called the center myself. the totals that my sister were asking were completely different than what the girl on the phone told me. at the end of the conversation, the girl says "so you're [bil's] sister? that's so weird! his wife called the other day and didn't seem nearly as interested in the payment options as you are!". around the same time i noticed my sister has changed to fundraising goals from 70 000 to 175 000. i was far too busy to give it much thought at this point though. so the day of the fundraiser my sister walks in and i say (genuinely pleased to see her) "oh awesome! you made it! have you decided if you want to be involved at all?" she scowls and says "i don't even want to fucking be here". i'm a pretty ballsy person, and any other day i would have promptly punched her in the face and walked out, but this was for my bil, so i smiled and said "oh, i'm really sorry to hear that. why don't you have a seat my dad and just relax, put all your food and drink on my bill and i'll take care of it. we've got you a ride home if you want to drink, and i'll take care of everything else for you. i love ya, [sis]". as mc, host and the main organizer of everythjng , i was running around like a chicken either my head cut off the whole night. the only times i saw my sister was sitting on other guys laps, bitching about her husband, bidding on auction items (how fucking innapropriate) or telling her friends i'm a cunt (she also was a bitch to my friends and had i known that at the time i would have called it off right then and there - you do not fuck with my friends who have supported not only me, but you through this!!) about half way through the event, one of my team had approached me telling me a gift card had gone missing. fuck. that's all on me. i quickly rallied everyone to help, but my sister had quickly come over and told everyone it was taken care of. i forgot about it until my friend (that donated that gift certificate) showed up and asked about it. i had no answer and sister was effectively evading me all night. the next day (since the fundraiser ended up running until after 2am) i called around (to everyone except my sister) looking for the gift card. i put about 9 people's stories together to figure out what happened. my sister stole the fucking gift card. for herself. from her dying husbands fundraiser. then she blamed everything on me and made a bunch of wild, false accusations. basically, i got numerous phone calls, texts, e-mails and facebook messages (to the point i had to shut my phone off and deactivate my facebook) telling me what an awful person i am, and how could i steal something from bil's fundraiser and blame it on my poor sister. ummmmmm, what?! what?! that's good for my depression and anxiety. so i called my mom, bawling, telling her i wanted to die and i don't understand. she yelled at me and told me to apologize to my sister. (fuck that - i didn't speak to anyone in my family for over 9 months). i had concrete evidence proving she did it. i could have got her charged. i spent my entire vacation fund on them and didn't even get a fucking thank you. my theory, that i pieced together a few weeks after, is that my sister expected bil to die before we could raise the money to send him for treatment, leaving her with a nice little chuck of money to take care of her stupidly expensive lifestyle (3 very expensive vehicles, 4 houses, property on a lake, a holiday trailer, quad, boat, etc). well shit, i don't do anything half-assed. within a few days we had raised half the money, by the end, he had enough to go (before she changed the total). out of the 70 000 or so raised, i single handedly raised over 50 000. also, who leaves their dying husband as home to look after their 2 small children under 5 to go to mexico?! a week after the fundraiser! i decide to let herself shoot herself in the foot and just move out of the house they owned asap. this happened to coincide with their cross-canada trip, and they tried to sue me! (they had no grounds to do so and i actually ended up with 50 bucks from them - ha!), but now i'm getting a little revenge. i couldn't bring myself to tell the entire world what they did ( though i easily could have), but i did decide to fuck with them. while i lived in the rental, i did a bunch of work on it for them for free, so there was plenty of extra paint, drywall, etc around. i looked up the most common and troubling pests in our area and how to attract them. then i went shopping. the list included fish heads, shrimp, pest attractants, clearance meat, etc. i left the place immaculate. except for the rotting food in the walls. yup. i punched a hole in the wall, filled it up in several places, drywalled, mudded/tapped and painted over it. i hear the place is unrentable now, and going through renovations. tl;dr: i spent an obscene amount of time and money on a fundraiser that my sister stole a gift card from (and blamed on me), so i filled the walls of her rental house with rotting food. edit: a word. edit 2: for those asking, my bil is still alive, though i have heard his health is declining. so far as i know (things change quickly around here and i don't really care enough to keep up), he has not been send to the treatment center that we all fundraised for. they say they can't afford it (which is a lie, i know all the numbers of the fundraiser and how much it was to send him there). they have not sold a single thing they own, but he is supposedly attending treatment a province over. they say that the money is going towards that, but the treatment itself is actually free. i believe they have used some of the money to fly him over for treatment. that's all i really know...hi, prorevenge. i'm posting here on the suggestion of some fine people over at /r/talesfromretail. this story chronicles how someone got what was coming to them, even in the otherwise powerless position of an employee in a "customer is always right" society. **/////warning: wall of text below./////** i'll preface by saying that i've been working in a grocery store for over a year now, and have culminated my own collection of nightmare-inducing run-ins with people hellbent on making everyone around them despise their entire existence. this story starts with my second day out of training on a register as a cashier. it is currently "super doubles" week, where our store will double the value of coupons up to $2 (meaning a $2.00 coupon is worth $4.00, for non-grocery workers). this is obviously very bad for a new employee, because the store gets a very bad case of "the crazies," and 1 in 3 customers will actively try to scam you to get away with invalid or fake coupons. management doesn't seem to mind, however, and i'm thrown on a register, still quite nervous about the job, unsure of what to expect. fast forward 4 hours later: i'm approaching the end of my shift, i'm a little more confident and more proficient, and have already seen a lot of really scummy customers. then **it** comes to my lane. barely 5'2" of shoddily-dyed, blonde, scraggly hair, a gucci purse, a torn, ragged sweater, and bunny slippers. yes, that's right, bunny slippers. it (to be referred to as ms. a) is an infamous customer who is (unbeknownst to me at the time) notorious for picking out new employees and scamming them. she has picked me out because she spent hours at a time in the store for around a week to see who is new, who pays attention to what, and who her best option is. really, if it wasn't pathetic, i'd be impressed. anyway, the transaction goes underway, and she, being a veteran scumbag, [gets away with 3-4 coupons off]( her total. i am told this by the customer service clerk(csc) who reviewed my till. it was at that time i vowed to get her back, and get her back good, because beyond being rude and smelling a little like onions, she had a smug look of "hah, i'm better than you and you work in a low job where you can't even say anything about it." you see, i'm a vindictive sonofabitch, and i really don't like getting taken advantage of. as a preparation for my plan, i took a picture of the coupons she used with my phone and stashed them back in the folder where they are kept. fast forward 5 months: i am now a self-checkout clerk. much better at the job now, the csc who first told me about ms. a scamming me is a good friend of mine at this point. another super doubles week is upon us, and ms. a, sure enough, makes another appearance. same slippers, same purse, same hair. i ask the csc if she can make a copy of the transaction ms. a makes by using the customer service desk computer. the csc agrees, staying that it's probably a good idea if she ever does get caught. ms. a knows not to try going through my line by now, as i am experienced, so she goes to a newer cashier to try to scam. i go to the new cashier's station to help her bag. i don't say anything about the coupons, despite blatant scamming, but i do snap a picture of the coupons and grab a copy of the receipt from the csc at the end of the shift to store away. ms. a came in 2 more times that week and repeated the procedure, i was able to collect evidence at 1 of the instances. fast forward 3 months: i am now a coarse, war-torn veteran of retail, working as a csc, dealing with the worst dregs that society can cough up at me. i have now culminated about 13 fraud-latent transactions that ms. a has pushed through a register at this point, all showing in rather great detail what items were voided, how many coupons were used, and even what the value of the coupons were and when they were scanned. my old csc friend is a co-manager at this point, and has been in on my plan for vengeance for a while now, and is actively trying to help me catch her in the act. during a slow day, my friend calls me from the front desk to her office. she says she has a plan to deal with ms. a for good: she will ask the security guard who watches self-checkout when the tills are pulled at night to contact the police to be on standby during our upcoming super doubles week. i didn't know that it was possible to request that police remain on standby for such issues, but somehow my co-manager friend did it. fast forward 1 month: super doubles. i prepare for a rough week of "but i want this with this coupon, they're the same thing." and "why didn't this coupon that says 'do not double' double???'" then it happens. ms. a fumbles into the store. i hear over my earpiece "ms. a is here, novvacaine, tell the security guard." i hurriedly do, and sit back anxiously waiting for the fireworks. ms. a, blissfully unaware of the world of pain about to be lowered on her, slowly scans the shelves for what she wants for over 2 hours (if you've worked in retail before, you know these types of people. don't they ever get bored of going from store to store? christ, go watch some tv or something!). she goes to a (very) new cashier and proceeds to attempt scam the hell out of the poor girl, asking to void one item, add another, scan one coupon, clear another item, then add another item. a relatively simple confusion technique used to get away with getting extra coupons. **for clarity purposes: i will iterate that this is fraud and theft. don't do it, and if you do, stop it. all the employees know your face, name, and buying habits.** i make a copy of the register's actions up front as i always do with ms. a, but this time was different. as soon as ms. a swipes her card, two police officers, side-by-side, walk up to ms. a, and ask her to step aside and speak for a moment. ms. a, obviously distressed, yells "no! leave me alone i'm doing nothing" and tries to push past the officers. the two officers are not in the business of dealing with her crap and quickly grab her and take her aside, bunny slippers in tow. her gucci purse still on the counter. the purse, precariously perched on the edge, falls over after the commotion. 3 unopened bottles of nyquill and a 16 pack of lithium batteries roll out onto the desk. i couldn't contain my laughter, and i said aloud "fucking score." and then proceed to close off the cashier's lane and guide customers elsewhere. ms. a. didn't return, a police officer came and took the purse, the day's security tapes, my copies of the months of transactions, and took a picture of the attempted stolen goods. nothing else was said about ms. a for quite some time. fast forward to yesterday evening. my co-manager friend and i are at the front desk, she is working in the front office in accounting, and i am counting tills from the day. i hear her on the phone, nothing too unusual. a little laughing, muffled speaking, and so on. she steps out from the office with a grin from ear to ear. "ms. a just got convicted of theft and some drug charges, long jail time from what i understand. your transaction records pretty much sealed the case." apparently the dm of the store personally was at the court to see how it all played out. holy. shit. best day ever. see, i like to think i learned something about the nature of retail and "the customer is always right," at the end of this ordeal: it's just a baiting game to see who is willing to step in shit enough times to eventually start smelling so bad they can't deny it anymore. it may not always work, but when it does, sweet baby jesus, it's like christmas, and when they do catch the people responsible, like ms. a quickly found out, they soon learn that there are no coupons for bail.my mom lives in a college town with her partner and one of her passions is gardening. they like to sit out on the porch on nice nights and were doing just that when a drunk college bro parks in front of their house and starts walking through their front garden. my mom points out that he's walking through her garden and he calls her a dyke cunt and continues on to their neighbors (still through her garden) who are throwing a party. mom #2 who is pretty handy takes a valve stem remover to his tires and within minutes all four of his tires are flat. drunk college bro returns to his car (now even drunker), doesn't notice and drives off on his rims. mom calls the cops.[this]( tale reminded me of the time my boss was having lunch and got blocked in by a ups truck. the parking in front of the restaurant was diagonal and you had to feed a meter for up to 30 minutes of parking, not unreasonable and usually plenty of time to eat lunch or shop. ~~bob~~ john was a good guy and a good boss, but he had his limits. these limits were tested when he found his work van blocked in by a ups truck when he came out. it was one of those big ones - you know the type. this was not the first time, so john lit a cigarette and waited patiently before being joined by another person who had parked there and was now blocked in. surely the ups driver would be back shortly, after all it only takes a few minutes to do a delivery and such double-parkers were usually gone in a short amount of time. this was not one of those times. after about 10 or 15 minutes he began to seek out the offensive driver, peeking into several local restaurants &amp; shops, but no luck. the ups van stayed where it was. john was running out of cigarettes and patience, and he had appointments to keep. he then looked inside the open door of the ups truck, hoping to find a clue as to where the driver might be. clues were not to be found ... but the keys were still in the ignition. *hmmmm!* he looked around again, still no sign of the driver. so he climbed into the driver seat and started the engine, put the massive truck in gear, and moved it forward far enough for both him and the other guy (remember the other guy who was blocked in?) could get out. but now the truck was in the way of other cars. feeling that the rude ups driver had already used up his allotment of double-parking time, he decided to keep going. he smiled at the other driver and drove down the street. he later described the feeling as a heady mix of exhilaration and apprehension, half expecting a shout of indignation from the driver or a police siren demanding he stop stealing the truck, but none came. he proceeded to the end of the block, then drove past the intersection and around a curve. still not good enough. he turned into a residential area, made another turn, and parked the truck next to a fire hydrant and blocking the entrance to an apartment driveway before walking the few blocks back to his truck. along the way he stopped at pay phone (this was before cell phones) and called the local police department and, as a concerned citizen, reported the illegally parked truck ~ which by that time had been illegally parked for about an hour (technically the truth). not sure what happened to the truck or the driver ~ john went on to his appointment and we never heard any more. but we did notice that ups trucks never parked in that area for more than five minutes after that. *edit - speling*[–]stoicassistant 1472 points 5 hours ago (2239|767) it was april 1st, 2012 and i was in cramming mode for exams. i had popped an adderall and was extremely concentrated on my work when all of a sudden my phone buzzed. unknown number: "heyy i saw ur ad on cl and i wanna buy ur phone please" *wrong number* i get back to work and within 2 minutes my phone rings. a different number. "hi i'd like to buy your phone please." "sorry, you've got the wrong number." as soon as i hang up, i realize... *oh fuck, this is a prank.* i get on craig's list and immediately find out that my roommate is "selling my brand new iphone 4 for us$100. call me asap at 555-5555-5555" *that motherfucker.* in the next two hours i got a total of probably 100 calls and texts. i was gonna get him back good. with the adderall still coursing through me, i racked my brain for the best possible prank i could pull. then i remembered i had introduced him to the deep web two days ago. we were surfing it, we had checked out the armory, the silk road, even the assassin's advertisement pages. and at one point, on his computer, we stumbled onto child porn. i knew how i was going to prank him. when he got home, there was an official fbi envelope waiting for him. inside, [**this letter**]( i lifted correct names, signatures, court addresses, court dates and official language (other than misspelling appertaining), but that didn't really matter. as soon as he opened it up, he almost started crying. i had to tell him it was a prank within seconds because he just broke down. i was in an accident that left me unable to work for quite a spell. it was obvious that i wasn’t at fault – it was an open and shut case, but that means nothing until the judge brings his gavel down. the claim exceeded the amount of insurance that the other guys had, so the insurance company had nothing to lose by dragging the case out, which they did. their lawyer managed to get adjournment after adjournment, hoping to starve me out and settle for a pittance. he almost succeeded. in the years following the accident, the bills piled up, my marriage fell apart, and my credit rating was destroyed. i hocked and sold anything i had of value just to put food on the table. i eventually had to get foodstamps to survive. i lived in a small town, and this was humiliating to say the least. the worst part was the little half smile their lawyer would give me at the end of each adjournment. one night, while trying to glue a toy together for one of the kids, a revenge plan presented itself. it was time for him to feel what it was like to have his life interrupted. the courthouse had a several story parking structure that everyone used. it offered a number of good hiding places. this was before there were security cameras everywhere. i took a small pin, cut the head off of it so it was just a small straight shaft with a pointed end, and then super glued it to his door latch. i did stay to watch, and sure enough, he jammed his hand into the pin while opening his car door. the pin fell to the ground – he never saw it. by the way he jumped and screamed, i’m guessing he thought it was a burr on his latch. i then waited a few hours and then used a pay phone (this was years ago) at the court house and dialed his office. when he came to the phone, i asked him how his hand was (i disguised my voice). he immediately made the connection. i then told him that he had pricked himself on a hypodermic needle that came from an aids patient. his scream was most satisfying. the whole call lasted less than a minute. i did see him in court a few months later, and he looked like hell. i wasn’t in a loop to learn how he reacted, but i assume he underwent a lot of aids testing before he was satisfied that he didn’t have the disease. i’m guessing (hoping) that he did have a certain stigma during that time. in 1995-1996, i was a fine and applied arts major in college. basically, i was a guy who loved to paint. as such, i took a job at a major retail art's and craft's chain. we had a great group of people that managed every department. i would work 20-30 hours per week. it was primarily for the discounts i would receive on art supplies. in fact, when old oil colors had "expired", i would receive both the markdown price and the employee discount. life was great. pay was good, and everyone got along. i had worked there for 9 months and everything seemed to being going well until they hired a new person as their assistant store manager. her name was unique (this only matters because of future background checks), but as soon as she was hired, she decided to change things about the store. i am a person who is liberal in many respects, particularly when it comes to fair and equal treatment of all people. but she did not see it in that manner. she was a very militant lesbian. at first we seemed to be friends. she asked me what i thought about her lifestyle and my response is the same as it is today.... everyone deserves the same treatment and opportunities. i don't care what you do... i am neutral in all matters. that was until she started firing people and getting her friends jobs in this store. she had a friend whom wanted a job in the framing dept.... well, she went out of her way to fire a person. she was targeting people so she could hire her friends. she ever fired the 6'3" gay guy from his position in the floral dept so her friend could get a job there. she was just a terrible person with a chip on her shoulder. things came to a head when she made false accusations against both the manager and the other assistant manager for harassment against her gender preference. she had her friends back her claims up. i knew that these 2 individuals made no such claim, as one was a pretty good friend. i knew i was next... and low and behold, that day came. what she failed to acknowledge was that i had been watching and waiting prior to my termination. they became to comfortable in their positions. she and her friends would love to visit this local karaoke bar, after work, and sing. what she failed to understand was that i knew they also loved to go around the back of this bar and smoke pot between their sets. so, i simply called the cops and told them that these people are smoking pot behind this bar. needless to say, she was arrested, as were her cohorts. apparently, as per the grape vine, they were holding. tldr; don't fire people and replace them with your own friends if you are going to do illegal activities and make them know to the staff that hates you!so i’ve been only lurking reddit for a while, but now that i’ve discovered this subreddit, i’m surfacing because i have a story for you. this is, by far, the worst i’ve ever done to someone else, but i don’t actually regret it. heads up, this story is long. it happened when i was in my third and last year in a religious high school. the boy in question was in my class and even though he was friend of my friends i’d never actually interacted with him. semester started and he’s nice and friendly with me, so i was too. then he stepped it up, acting the gentleman, offering to carry my things from my locker to our classroom, even if those things were just a couple of notebooks. this is when it actually started. i’ve always been a private, self-sufficient girl. i dislike it when people offer to do things for me that i’m perfectly capable of doing myself. so after a whole day of offering to carry my books at the start of every class, i told him something like how i appreciated his wanting to help, but that i was most comfortable carrying my things myself and if i ever needed help i would ask him. i was raised polite and i will die polite. so he backed off… one day. the next he kept at it, and the next, and the next. every. single. class. for almost the whole semester. it didn’t matter how many times i said no, thanks. or how many times i asked him to stop. or how by mid-semester i resorted to outright ignore his offers. he would sit close to me and take my things without my permission. sometimes he would forcefully take my books from my hands to carry them himself. he would poke me to find my ticklish spots and, when he found out i don’t have them, he’d poke me harder, like he thought the tickling spots were deeper and he’d find them if he kept digging, and that was actually painful. he would ambush me everywhere and he would loudly imply i was lesbian with my bff (this was a very religious school, with textbooks on how homosexuality was a big sin, so you can imagine how well it would have gone if direction got wind of that). he was vulgar and seriously nasty. i’m sure he stalked me at least once. some people thought he liked me. now, i’m also very non-confrontational. and i have very high levels of patience and tolerance that one professional told me aren’t exactly healthy. so didn’t tell him to fuck off, just kept politely asking to stop but he just didn’t (the school wasn’t helpful at all, he was 18 and i was about to be as well, so we’re adults who should had been able to talk this out with civility). when that semester ended and the very last one of high school started, i was dreading my first encounter with him. it went on like usual, but, to my own surprise, i was starting to discover i may actually had a finite supply of patience. i asked again for him to stop and still he refused to listen. i can’t remember if it was by the start of the semester or halfway, but i do remember we were changing classrooms to take a class called values (it was like ethics and religion rolled into one, it “taught” you how to be a better person, which, given what happened, i find hilarious). it was very early so the teacher and most of my classmates hadn’t arrived yet. the seats were arranged in a huge circle and he sat next to me (seats were those chair/desk hybrids, fyi). he immediately took my mechanical pencil and i snapped it back. he took my notebook and held it out my reach, then he fucking poked my side like he wanted to stab me with his fingers and that’s it. that’s the moment when my patience ran out and complete, outrageous fury overtook me. i saw black, like my vision just went tunnel on him and all i could see was the damn smug smirk he gave me every time i asked him to stop. over six fucking months of having to stand his creepy, bully self. i’d had enough of that motherfucker. he lowered my notebook when he poked me and his hand was splayed on top of it, over his desk. i still had my mechanical pencil in my hand, grabbed so tightly it was almost shaking. i was so angry, i didn’t care about consequences. i stabbed his hand with my pencil. he was in shock, didn’t scream, didn’t move, just stared at me face blanched, open mouthed, eyes big and fearful, like he was seeing me for the first time, and i was something too scary to comprehend. i leaned forwards and just whispered: “leave. me. alone.” then i took my pencil, my notebook and sat back in my seat, all while watching how blood trickled down his hand. mind you, the force with which i stabbed him wasn’t that great, just enough for the lead sleeve of the pencil to break skin and lodge the lead between two knuckles. nevertheless, it was strong (and painful) enough to send the message i wanted. he never again approached me. now, i’m not sure why he didn’t tell on me. be it shame, guilt or whatever else, i was never called for it, even when i’m pretty sure we weren’t alone in the classroom, so he could have had witnesses. this was ten years ago and i last saw him about six or seven, when a common friend hosted a generation party. he came up to me and as greeting he showed me his hand. the skin had healed around the lead, which he never took out, because i could see a tiny black dot between two knuckles.this story takes place in scotland (united kingdom) and is looooong so apologies in advance. i've had some dumb luck the past 5 years of my work history. i am an administrator/office type. so i applied for a job (i had been out of work for 3 years prior due to a hormone condition and depression) at company a and got a job as a call handler in a telephone answering service. over a few years i kept that same shitty job title and pay but was actually more the office manager due to the workload and how much of a distance there was between what my daily work was compared to anyone else. so, long story short i lost a baby, the company owner made a comment in front of me to a client "should have kept a hand on her ha'penny" (meaning i should have kept a hand on my vag and not had sex/conceived) so i walked out without notice and because i was the only one running admin in the place, it all stopped and she lost her biggest client. :-d i landed another job at company b as an admin assistant. it should have been easy, something low key to keep me financially until i could recover from losing the baby. also at this time i had moved house and was saving for my wedding which was made known to the owner of the company. that is why i applied for the lower ranked and paid position. within the year i was running an entire central production unit for a chain of cafe's and deli's. still on low pay and shitty admin assistant job title. you see a reoccurring theme here? as i was about to demand a pay rise and proper job title for the work i did, the owner puts the whole company into administration and cuts everyone's hours. i sucked it up to keep the place going. i worked hard and got the cpu into profit. owner says everyone needs to slash their hours more because other depts are losing money. i refuse to cut mine. im already down to the bone financially. he agrees to have a meeting about it but instead jets off on holiday. i hear back from company c re a role i applied for as an admin, learn i have a new job to go to so walk out the very next day. the place is still in administration many years later with massive job losses and they closed half their locations. turns out my work was the only thing keeping the cpu open and when i left, they had to close it down because no one else knew how to run it and they failed a hygiene inspection too! company c takes us to the true prorevenge. at first, things are amazing. great hours, pay and im treated really well. i start to put the past behind me thinking the way things went at the last two companies must be a fluke. company c rewards my hard work with a pay rise and better job title after 3 months! but then they start to take me for granted... after 4 months of being there, i am moved to the sister company which is the installation branch (fitting insulation under government grants to residential homes). i am to run the installation and warehouse operations with a small admin team and it will be temporary with my reward being a move to office manager when the current manager angela goes on maternity leave. on this basis, i accept. (the idea was when angela comes back, she will be moved to oversee another dept) so while i am running installations, i have a nervous angela to accomodate as she is still my manager in theory and wants me to use her crappy basic spreadsheets so she can feel like she is still in control but i also have 3 director/owners (swishy, stupid and sly) constantly coming in and contradicting each other over what they want and targets etc. i juggle making everyone happy, meet the targets and get processes and procedures in place - oh and i am still doing tasks from my old role as they don't have anyone else to take care of that! i have issues with the team they hired to do admin under me. lazy, slutty and shy. lazy plays on facebook all day, slutty flirts and chats all day and shy is quietly handling way too much but too afraid to speak up. so i report the team issues and they get pulled into a meeting. remember, i am a senior administrator not a manager. i get brought in afterwards and director stupid decideds that they are all perfectly fine and competent and its my fault they aren't doing their jobs. i suck it up, thinking he may be right and try to work on my management style. nothing changes. in fact, it takes director sly coming in on a day when all 3 are off and i am doing all of their jobs by myself for the bosses to notice how little my team actually have to do. but again, why do anything about it when mora582 can take it on and cover it all as well? nothing is done about the 3 stooges and my workload continues as is. shortly thereafter it is announced the new office manager will be claire... i am livid but think maybe i am going to be made the official installations manager as this is hinted at by other managers. i have at this point only been in the new role 2 months. then the stress got to me and i was off ill for a week. while i was off, everything fell apart, my admin staff stopped doing any work at all and some installs were reported as complete when they hadn't been. so director swishy swoops in and orders the whole place be audited. he suspends me and warns me to look for another job. he tasks the audit to claire. (claire is 24 years old and this is her second job ever.) claire looks and acts much older than she actually is so you get fooled into thinking she is better than she is. she is also the type to blame others for her mistakes or great at hiding them. she gets to the root of those installs being declared complete when they weren't as one installer presigning his paperwork. he would have brought that in and given it to slutty who should have then rebooked the job and put the paperwork back out. but of course she didn't because she wasn't doing any work while i was off. so the bosses can't pin the blame on me (before i went off sick, i was supposed to be off for 1 day and had left a detailed list of everyone's daily job and tasks so other managers would know who does what) and decide to pull me back into my old role and put lazy, slutty and shy into lesser admin roles. this means no promotion for me. they then hire a new admin team and make one of them the fucking manager (she has no experience and sleeps with the installers). but wait, it gets better! 2-3 months later i am now working directly under director sly and the operations manager; lizard king. in fact, i am doing all of lizard king's work and taking abuse and bullying from him as no one else can stand working near him. i am doing jobs well outwith my remit like tendering for work and running the entire qms. i am in effect, the assistant ops manager. no pay rise or job title though. now we get to the end. i effectively hold the keys to the kingdom. there is no part of the business i don't know and haven't run or had a part in getting up and runnng. i am relied upon for almost everything. they call me the cornerstone of the office. at this point i've been with company c less than 2 years. claire is still called the office manager but all she does is oversee a small team who submit completed installs to the funder for payment. she doesn't know anything actually office manager related. i have a run in with director stupid. he allowed lizard king to bully his assistant so she quit. i am forced, despite protesting, to also take on her work which is wiping his dumb ass. he calls me after hours with stupid comments like did you photocopy x and call y (after i emailed him to say i had before i left work and verbally told him i had emailed him). i arrange a really important compliance audit to allow time to get it done right and he calls them behind my back and rearranges cutting the time i have to do the work in half. this compliance audit costs us thousands and is really important to get more work. its all too much and i get sicker and sicker. finally i decide i will quit. i tell the office yap i am thinking of quitting knowing word will spread and it does. director swishy takes me aside and begs me not to leave, he gives me a paid week off and says to come in the monday after for a talk. i think things are finally changing so agree. except that i notice on the sunday that director swishy posts on facebook that he is hungover and taking monday off. so i don't go back. i get a phone call late on tuesday and director swishy is literally begging me to come in. i tell him everything and that he doesn't even pay me enough for what i do. he starts to cry. his tears are like fucking bliss to me! cry fucker! i tell him no way, i am done and he won't see me again. i then call up company d - who is their biggest rival and most hated nemesis. company d is owned by two former staff of company c who were treated like shit, walked out and started up their own version of company c. they give me a job. i then remember i never signed a non compete so i call up company c's best sales staff and offer them jobs. i get their top man to come join us and he brings a handful of install leads with him (customers he was screwed out of commission on). company c panic when they realise and try to set the lawyers on us. there is no case. they then call us and harrass us, visit the office etc. we don't back down. they actually think we have their entire lead database (we don't) and are shitting bricks. finally i get a phone call from director swishy. again, he is crying. "please don't ruin us! i know you are behind this. please just destroy the database and this will all be over." bla bla i let him think i am thinking about it. eventually company c is forced to buy a new database and only then do i call him back and tell him that we only ever had 5 or 6 leads he could describe as being on his database but those leads came to us through a third party and we hadn't gotten any sales so scapped them. company c have since closed the sister installations company down (most of the staff were made redundant for unrelated reasons not my doing) and are now a company of 3 directors, 3 managers and 1 admin from 80+ staff. claire has been given all of my work and complains constantly as well as a demotion. angela got fired for being useless, lizard king has had his hours and pay cut and claire is going to be forced out soon as the owners are talking about selling up. i get all the updates from the company accountant whom they bullied so bad, she lost her hair and is now working for me part time. &gt;;) revenge: making your former bosses pay thousands for something they don't need, lose another £10k on compliance audits they failed when you walked out and make at least one of them cry. twice. company d so far are treating me like a queen. if shit turns sour here, it won't matter. i have the keys to the kingdom again... tl;dr 3 diff companies i worked for treated me badly and took me for granted. i walk out and leave them in shit. last company took a hit for over £25k and made the owner cry. twice. so as a quick background for those who don't know mtg (magic the gathering) is a competitive card game with cards ranging from $00.01 to $30000 in price. at our local game store there's a guy who's known for being pretty dodgy with trades, he always has the latest cards but if you want to get them you kind of have to throw a few extra dollars worth of cards towards them, regardless of whether or not your cards are worth more/ harder to find or such. so my partner sees that said person has 4 "scublands", very powerful cards that essentially give you 2 colours of mana (what you use to cast cards) without any downside (i.e pretty much better than every other land out there to date.) they are worth at the time $100 in mint condition and are pretty hard to find, so of course she calls me excitedly asking if we can get them or not, to which i say sure. a week goes by and we begin to notice that the cards seem pretty different to the average card, visibly no difference but after some testing it becomes apparant that they are fake. after parting with $400 for the cards you can understand why the both of us were upset that we'd paid $400 for something worthless, unusable and reputation damaging if we continued in trading them off. after confronting said player about these cards they inform us that "they didn't know they were fake." so he's not going to refund us the money, even if we gave him back the cards. our shop owner says that he can't do much to stop this and suggest we come to a deal between ourselves, which the guy is 100 percent opposed to. this made me angry. when he goes to the bathroom i check his folder and notice he has many high value trade cards that seem to have also been faked, and he has been trying to trade for cash, real cards or various other things from people in the shop. so i picked the folder up, passed it to the store owner who knows magic like the back of his hand, who determines that they are fake indeed but he has to witness the guy trying to sell them. the guy comes out the toilet and we pass the folder to him stating we thought someone had left it there and we were just worried as he almost caught us, he pays himself into a high level tournament that cost $40 to enter in the lgs and proceeds to get to the final round, with almost $1000 in prizes this is a big deal. so the owner and i come over to the table and request to "deck check" the deck he's playing with, making sure his deck is within the rules, standard practice in the tournament. he passes the deck over and the owner pulls out each fake card in his office in front of myself, stamps them with a large stamp with the word "proxy" (aka not a real card.) in giant red ink, hands the deck back, disqualifies the asshat from the tournament as well as requesting that he does not trade here until he trades non "proxy"/fake cards. the guy flips his shit, demands his money back, demands proof (which the store owner then gives.) followed by general swearing and name calling and the like. the store owner looks him in the face, tells him bluntly that he is calling the cops for fraudulent trading (or something like that.) and unless he hands his folder over with the fake cards he will see him in court and make sure he doesn't play in any of the other stores around the state. the guy red faces starts screaming to which the store owner plain and simply picks him up and moves him outside (he's a 6"8' fairly built guy surprisingly) he bans the person from coming to his store and says that if he doesn't leave immediately he will end up with a night in a prison cell. i go up, take the guys trade folder and sell the very few real and good cards in his folder for about $500 and leave the fakes in a bin with the folder in question, with the guy not to be seen again. i got my money back, and after hearing a bit of news from a store owner close by i found out that the guy had tried the same crap in another store and was immediately caught out due to our store owner spreading word of him. hasn't been seen since. owner also offered a free tournament with same prize for all participants in the tournament scumbag got to finals in so everybody won :) tldr: magic card trader scams $400 of cards, gets caught due to my self and good store owner, gets kicked out and banned without being able to grab his folder, get about $500 from the remains and his expensive fake collection binned. also kicked out from an expensive tournament final round very publicly and embarrassingly.**originally posted this in pettyrevenge, was told to post this here, so here we go:** this is a story from when i was in 8th grade. to provide a little background, i was a nerdy kid of less than 100 pounds with no muscle whatsoever. i was frequently bullied because of this, usually just verbal but sometimes more. this kid named a realized that he could take my lunch and i couldn't do anything about it, so that went on for a few days. he had a particular taste for packaged meat products- this is important. after the second time he stole my lunch (and i went hungry as a result), i was fed up. i went home, took a piece of beef jerky, and soaked it in dave's insanity sauce for 36 hours. after sampling the meat (holy shit was it spicy, and i have a high tolerance for heat), i brought it in to school. i told my friends and classmates what was about to go down so that they could watch it happen. well, what do you know, a came around and snatched the beef jerky out of my hands at lunch. i hardly complained, just told him it was a special recipe of mine. he took a giant bite and started to talk about how spicy it was, me telling him that was how i like it (and with a big shit-eating grin on my face). fast forward to 10 minutes later and a was visibly sweating, face red, swearing loudly about the beef jerky he was still nibbling on so he didn't look like a bitch in front of his friends. he snatched my fruit snacks and applesauce, ate them in front of me, and then i knew i had to end this once and for all, so i tried to think of a plan. meanwhile, a spent the rest of lunch blocking anyone else from using the water fountain in order to wash the heat from his mouth. on the way back from lunch, a still swearing at me, i told him i knew a little trick to get the heat out. i told him to just massage the corners of his eyes, right near the tear ducts... ...a spent an entire period crying into the water fountain to wash the spice out of his eyes. he never stole my lunch again. and neither did anyone else.long time lurker, 2nd time poster. my (former) 'best friend' who i will call tim had a crush on me. i was in a relationship already with 'andy'. being the naive teenager i was, i did not realise tim had feelings for me we go a house party (myself, tim, andy + friends). tim drinks for the first time. he creates a scene and starts telling my friends that andy abuses me... andy has to be taken outside to ensure he doesn't go ham on tim. i calm andy down and then i take tim into the room, we sit on the bed and talk it out. he professes his love, i get a bottle of wine (needed it coz shit got real). i got tipsy... he started sexually harassing me. i sober up, freak out and tell andy that tim hit on me. tim starts telling everyone that i'm a lying whore who cheats on her boyfriend (if you call being sexually harassed whilst unable to defend yourself cheating, then i'm guilty). i lost friends over this. tim is extremely manipulative and emotionally abusive so i really don't blame them for falling for his silver tongue. i was humiliated, cried and left the party with andy (who believed me, as he was told by a mutual friend that tim intended to ruin our relationship). after the party, i stop speaking to tim and most of my friends. fast forward a year... ok, so now i explain my revenge: i basically emotionally manipulated my former friend (tim's now best friend). this is pretty much a story unto it's own. i found out where tim lived and currently worked. i waited for a job opening at tim's workplace. i applied for a role i was over-qualified for and was successful. i had to leave my job that i was at for over 4 years and also i had to defer college in order to take this full time sales job. when i saw tim, i acted elated. i took him to lunch and expressed my guilt over what happened that night at the party. this is one of the hardest things i've ever done. denying that i was harassed and acting though i was asking for it... made me sick to my stomach. after this, i had this fucker right in the palm of my hand. we were 'best friends' all over again, he trusted me entirely. i was out for blood and felt hatred toward him the entire time. this is important later: over my break i would fake interest in his job, and got him to teach me all he knew. i got him to train me over my break for a period of over 6 months. in the meantime he had bitched about every single one of my co-workers and their dogs... i wait for him to go on leave just before christmas (i convinced him to go then lol) and proceed to tell every single co-worker in that department what he had said about them the first day he was gone. boss received endless complaints the same day, but expressed that he couldn't 'fire' him due to not being able to hire anyone else before christmas, so this is where my 6 month administration and contract training kicks in. i demonstrate my skills to my boss, and by the days end, i take that fuckers job. (my job was easy to replace, as it was entry level sales, his was not). to avoid a possible shit storm, i advised my employer to retrench tim, and to also slightly change the title of my new job so he couldn't go to the union and sue (etc...). tim calls me up and tells me everything. we even met up and i consoled him. he was a mess. i told him that i could not believe i was given his position. i told him about the slight change of title on the job position too. about a week and a half later, i stopped showing up to work. i told tim i no longer needed the job as i was going to work with a friend. i told him i didn't even give my 2 weeks notice and left just before the busy christmas period. i acted as though the job was beneath me. i acted as though i hated/didn't need the job just to rub salt in his wounds. and oh boy... did my callous attitude work. he started drinking heavily, stopped showering and was pretty much disowned from his family. here this dude is un-employed, and i carelessly quit. just like that. naturally he was pissed, and so we arranged a meeting at a park with our friends to make up. i was going to let him off easy but no... he hit my friend (girl). i grabbed him by the scruff of his shirt, threw him down and dumped a large cola with ice on his head. i then asked him if he thought it was a coincidence that i started working at the same company. i saw him connect the dots, dazed, shocked, betrayed... i then burned some rubber in the car park and drove away. also, don't feel sorry for the company, every last one of them was a piece of crap (probably why i fit in so well with them :p). tldr; got harassed, took the fuckers job. until recently i had a small it consulting business, a domain i have had since 1996, and a google apps account using my domain. today i use google apps to keep the family together under a common email suffix, and to keep track of all the accounts and subscriptions i accumulated over the years. i have a catch-all email definition, so all email coming to an undefined address ends in my mailbox. there was always some abuse - a couple of times spammers used a fake address on my domain as the "send from" address, and i ended up with thousands of bounced mail and a few angry complaints. i learned to live with the occasional trouble, dealing with it when it comes. spf also helps a lot, and this is not a real issue any longer. however, during the past year or so, a bunch of people started using fake emails on my domain for various services and social platforms. for some people this is the ideal way: they can open an (unverified) account, use it, but not be on the mass email lists and ubiquitous notifications coming from the vendors. well, in the beginning it was a single albanian guy, and i just filtered him out. my inaction turned out to be a mistake. today there are 3 groups that abuse my domain: the ukrainians (all young women), the albanians who all seem to come from a single clan, and the malay guys. approximately 30 people. thanks to them i get dozens of daily mails from facebook, microsoft, skype and apple, as well as hundreds of mails from the dating services, ecommerce sites, gaming sites and whatever they bought. i was getting really pissed off and decided to fight back. my first action was 6 months ago, against m, a albanian guy whose name was getting 30-40 daily invitations to play silly games on facebook. all coming into my mailbox. i searched my mailbox and found out that he is also registered to dropbox. i reset his password, and peeked at his files. mostly boring stuff, birthdays with candles and cakes, some travels. except for one folder where he keeps his smut collection. bingo!!! the guy loves girls with big tits and i am ok with that. one picture in particular caught my fancy, he took a selfie of himself during anal intercourse with a girl whose face i saw in the family pictures. step 2 was to hijack his facebook password and post the shared link. the facebook account was closed after less than 48 hours. i placed m on a google delete filter. action #2 was a couple of days later: o is a nice ukrainian gal in her twenties, with a penchant for online dating services. she had subscriptions to at least 10 such sites, plus paid subscriptions to several horoscope and psychic readings. needless to say, dating sites generate zillions of marketing emails, or at least so it seemed to me. and i really don't think highly of people who manage their lives according to the horoscope. i am a one trick pony - what worked for m will work for o. i reset her password on 2 dating sites and changed her description to read: "i like anal sex with older men, preferably hairy and bald. i also like dogs. big dogs." for a couple of weeks i would log into her dating accounts just to see urgent messages the drooling perverts sent her. to be honest, after the initial hysterical laughter, i felt sorry for these guys (not the perverts, the email abusers). maybe they just got bad advice from someone, so i did not pursue additional revenge for a while. i am not a natural jerk. my domain name is similar enough to that of a hotel reservations web site, and when people mistype and send to me by mistake i usually respond to them and tell them to fix their addres. fast forward to may this year. a newcomer starts to stand out in the crowd. m, this time a malay guy, is a real jerk. he is trying to con some people in what looks like a pyramid scheme, thank you google translate for letting me understand the email content. he made the fatal mistake of mixing business with pleasure, and has a facebook account using his fake email. well, i don't have sympathy to jerks and to really stupid people who think they are really clever. thank you google translate for writing obscenities in malay, and thank you facebook for having low default account security measures. m posted on his timeline the following text: saya mempunyai pengakuan untuk membuat: saya suka menghisap zakar. i didn't have that much luck with a, s, s, and r: their facebook accounts are secured and require some security questions, but i did change their passwords and locked them out. t is another ukrainian girl living in hallifax, and she uses her fake email as an apple id to buy stuff in itunes. this is really stupid of her, and this is the highlight of my revenge: last week i erased her iphone via icloud. i am getting 10 daily requests to reset her apple id password :) looks like she has stuff in itunes. t, if you are reading this, tell your friends that stealing email accounts is immoral and wrong. tl;dr; people whom i don't know abuse email accounts in my domain, causing me to receive hundreds of unwanted and spam emails. i retaliated by hijacking social media accounts, posting on their behalf and locking them out. in one case i remotely erased an iphone belonging to an abuser. a few years ago, in my mid 20s, i was engaged to a guy. obviously i thought he was worth it at the time, but it turned out i was very wrong. my fiance was living with me, though he still maintained a studio apartment across town due to his super old-fashioned parents. they were footing the bill for some of the wedding and we decided to keep them placated by keeping up the illusion of living separately. one day, i came home and heard the telltale sounds of people screwing. my heart jumped up into my throat, then plummeted into my stomach. i thought there was no way it could be what i thought, that it must be some porn he was watching. it didn't sound like it was coming from a speaker, though. i crept to the bedroom and found him balls-deep in the woman who was going to be my maid of honor in a few months. i wanted to react right then, but didn't trust myself in my potential reaction. so i left, and started to think. here's where the revenge comes in. i purchased a camera to hide in the bedroom and record when i was gone. if he was dumb enough to have another woman in the bed in my home, he'd done it before and would do it again. it was a matter of waiting. eventually, i caught them and saved the recording to multiple places - physically and virtually. one long weekend, we were supposed to go visit his family, who lived a few hours away. i claimed i was sick, but insisted he go. while he was gone, i boxed up everything of his that was at my place (which was most of what he owned) and brought it to a storage unit about an hour from where we lived, in an area that had a couple dozen storage facilities. i then put the key for the storage locker in a lockbox in *another* storage unit. in a town an hour in the opposite direction from the starting point, or two hours from where his stuff was stored. i paid four months in advance for each, in cash. i used different names and each location. i also ground off any identifying marks on the keys that would let him know what brand locks were used. that done, i changed the locks on my place and printed a photo of him screwing my former friend in the box with it; in case that wasn't enough i included a cheap usb drive with the video on it. i also put a note, saying "good luck finding your things! finding the lock that this key fits is the first step." as a final burn, i sent a copy of the video to everyone we knew. including his family. after reading this subreddit for three straight hours, it's time. my mother is a cunt. she defines the term gold-digger. she got child support from my dad for four kids for a grand total of fourteen years and half his 401k. i was the youngest kid and got to experience the end of her first and second marriage and all of it's wonders. the second husband made 100k a year while she did temp jobs throughout their ten year marriage and spent every dime of the child support from my dad on herself and "bills" that she had to take care of. she expected my older brother and sister to pay her back for college tuition even though my stepdad paid for them both and all her personal bills. i turn 16 and i get my license. i am allowed to use one of her three cars since she can't afford to get one for me. a year goes by and the car's transmission (acura) goes out. so she promises me that she'll give me half of whatever i can sell the car for in order to buy myself one, thinking i'll barely make $1500. i end up selling the car for $3500 and so i expect her to pay at least $1500. doesn't happen. my dad hates her just as much as i do so he tells me that i can decide how i want things to plan out. we tell her that there's a car for $1200 being sold where he lives and that if she pays for it, he'll pay for maintenance. she can't bare to part with that much and says she'll do $1000. so we agree and she gives my dad the money and we part ways. my dad turns around and hands me the cash saying he already payed for the car which he got for $800 and i can keep the money and the car. it was well spent on school since she refuses to help pay for college even though i have a job, pay my own bills and live on my own with serious health problems. fuck the bitch. even though it was only $1000, it was the best money i've ever spent.there is a bit of long background, but it's all pertinent. my boss was the usual middle management guy (let's call him mmg) in an old contracting job. tightly wound, entirely focused on his subordinates' mistakes while trying to flatter upper management. i was under him and while most of the office feared him, i was less than enthused with his leadership. mmg would often make us complete several versions of the same product just in case management did not like the original product. no one ever saw these ghost product versions, except once when he took a part of one and passed it off as his own work. added to the fact that he provided zero encouragement and had the humor of a block of wood. yet when upper management was around, he was a completely different person. fawning and gregarious, he would assume a false rapport with the staff. when upper management left, he couldn't care less. while we didn't hate him, we did greatly dislike him. one instance made me want revenge. i strongly argued against a untenable product feature that mmg just "dreamed up." mmg argued equally strongly for it. it was more heated than i usually get. when upper management deep-sixed the feature, mmg blamed the team for it and actually called me in to say that "i should have been more clear in my objections." and he was a bit of a screamer. i was angry, but...i'm not a gotta get revenge guy. so i bided my time and hoped an opportunity would arise. one day the entire company has a retreat. everyone is meeting with different departments and the atmosphere is chill. over coronas and hacky sak, i meet boss dude (bd). bd is a family member of the owner, but perfectly competent in his own right as upper management. bd headed a different department than mine, so there was no office pressure. we both had similar interests and became fast friends. one characteristic that bd and myself shared was our affinity of pranks. i told him old office pranks i used to pull (before mmg) and he loved it. but we never talked shop and i never raised the subject of mmg (nor would i have even if given the opportunity). it was purely a friend-friend relationship. fast forward to several months later. in the interim, bd asked me to assist in some pranks in his department since i was an unknown there. harmless stuff mostly, like pretending i was accounting and footing someone with a fake bill on their company card. or helping to post-it someone's desk. it was a nice diversion from my office of gloom and was building my prank cred at the same time. i was tempted to use my influence to prank mmg, but it never felt right and i thought it would end up being a mistake, backfiring on me. but i know there is opportunity somewhere. then one day i receive an email titled *"significant issue"* from some senior guy i don't know. my mouth drops when i see the photo attached in the email. it's a actual picture of one of our product that our team works on with a close up of the instructions that i personally write and check. it reads normally until the end that says: --- *there are additional important steps for proper operation of this product. however, i am too drunk to write anymore, so just agree to be careful ok?* --- my heart stops as the email says, "this went out as-is in the final production, despite your check!! we will now have to recall all the affected units. care to explain??" i scramble to locate the file for the this product to check all its typography before i try to calculate the cost of this f'up. as the instructions are usually copperplate, i could imagine someone adding this into the product and it missing all subsequent checks. the weight of the world falls off my shoulders to see that our office put out the correct instructions without that addition. i have to take a moment to catch my breath before realizing the issue. i chuckle and start looking around. sure enough, bd is outside the plate glass looking in and laughing his ass off. we go have coffee and bd explains how he co-opted the design department to make a mock-up of a fake instruction label to prank me with. i'm a good sport (though admittedly slightly miffed) and compliment him on a solid, heart-attack inducing prank. bd is clearly proud of his efforts. a lightbulb goes on. i say, "wow, i almost died when i saw that. i bet my boss, mmg, would have the same reaction." i wheedle and flatter, saying how it would be nice to reuse the prank. eventually, bd is supportive of trying it out on mmg even though bd doesn't personally know mmg. it's revenge time. so....while bd stands outside the office, i write an email to mmg that is a foward of bd's prank email to me: --- *sir, let me first state that i am committed to solving this issue and you have my complete attention, as well as my apologies, in regards to this [attached picture]. while i acknowledge this reprinting might cost our department (insert large $$$$ figure), i think we can ameliorate these costs. for the sake of our team, in the near term i ask you to keep between you, me, senior guy who sent the first email, until the team can devise a way forward.* --- i went to an air show as a boy. loved it, especially as those jets would scream as they flew past. well, a few minutes after i hit send on the email and and mmg *screams* in his office and that scream increases as it flies toward my cube. the whole office freezes. mmg's face is purplish-maroon and for a second i wonder if he is going to pass out while screaming, "are you a f'ing idiot?". mmg leans on my desk and starts puffing. i am suddenly afraid for mmg's health and start telling him to calm down. this seems to infuriate him more as he says, "calm down? are you f***ing serious you (add horrible insults)." he starts just going off about how we can do this to him. finally, he takes the first thing on my desk (some instant coffee packet) and throws it against the wall. this galvanizes bd to come rushing in the room to ask mmg to calm down. mmg apparently knows bd and starts gushing about how i started a crisis -- basically trying to put distance between me and him -- and (gaining some sense) asked me and bd to come to his office. well, the meeting was short (for me) as bd explained how the email was not only a joke but bd's joke. after mmg calmed down, mmg tried to laugh off his behavior. i apologized, commiserating with mmg that the email "shocked me too." however, i knew the damage was done. at this point, bd asked me to leave and bd and mmg had a short, unknown discussion. after a few weeks, mmg was transferred and i think he eventually quit (not fired). bd cooled it on the pranks, but afterwards seemed to be surprised/pleased how the prank magically revealed a management problem. i was a pretty fucked up kid and to be blunt, it showed. had a rich boy pick on me in high school on a regular basis. a bit of violence, lots of intimidation, the whole dance of doing everything out of view of teachers, and a school system that tacitly sanctioned targeting of weird kids and me naive enough to believe that the system gave a shit about me. standard high school bullshit i suppose. i figured out where he lived and dumped a bottle of stupidly hot sauce (da bomb final solution?) into his pool. as expected, even diluted significantly, the mucous membranes of him and his family were not terribly happy. found out they drained the pool without washing the walls, spent a few hundred on refilling it - and enough remained on the walls to force them to drain it again, wash and refill :) i expected retaliation and kind of even hoped that i'd get the shit kicked out of me but but columbine happened and all the bullies across the country decided to examine their priorities for a few months. not mine, but my brother's story. he was driving across the city to a friend's place. he was in a lane that was ending soon, so flips on his turn signal, checks over the shoulder and in the mirror, sees a fellow a good distance back with plenty of room to spare and moves over. well, the other fellow didn't much care for that, as he'd been speeding (probably 30km/h over) like a typical bmw "my car is teh fastest" owner and, as a result, had to slow down to match my brother's 10 over. now, it wasn't close or anything, guy had plenty of time and room, but he got right up on my brother's tail and was flashing his lights and honking his horn. so there's a red light up ahead, couple cars stopped in front of my brother but the other lane is open. asshole jumps into the other lane, but instead of pulling up to the stop line, he stops next to my brother and does the "roll down your window" cranking motion. my brother does, guy starts yelling and cussing about how my brother nearly caused a massive pileup. he just starts laughing at the asshole and says, "you had plenty of room, sorry you had to slow down to only ten over." super polite and all. guy gets pissed, rolls forward, and peels out when the light turns green. a bit further down, the road turns a bit, then climbs a hill. now the cars in front of my brother had exited off, so it's just him and the asshole, who's a good bit ahead. my brother drives this road regularly and knows the police like to hide just over the hill, and our city was in the middle of what they call a "big ticket event," where cops all put in extra-special effort to set up speed traps and catch speeders. so the asshole slows significantly for the turn and my brother, having a good idea of his and his vehicle's limits, as well as familiarity with the road, doesn't slow at all and blows past the asshole partway through, making sure to smile and wave as he goes by. asshole is bound and determined to show him up and prove how fast his car is, so he lays into the throttle and, by my brother's estimation, is doing more than double the 50 km/h speed limit when he crests the hill. sure enough, there are about six cop cars parked, along with a couple flatdecks, and my brother sees the cop standing with the radar gun walk out, point at the asshole, and point to the roadside. last thing he sees in the rearview is guy on the side of the road. just some idle speculation, but around here, i'm told that the penalty for going double the limit is automatic license suspension, court date, and vehicle is impounded. i'd bet dollars to doughnuts his oh-so-badass base 318i was languishing in the impound lot for at least a day or two and he's probably taking the bus to work.tl;dr: got violent drug dealers arrested after shooting my tv via gas bombs. somebody at /r/pettyrevenge told me to post this here, so here you go. after my second year in college, a friend and i moved in with another friend. he was renting a 3 bedroom house in a lower income area, so it was pretty cheap. it was fairly close to the university campus, and as all three of us were attending, we were able to work it out where it would be a whole lot cheaper living there than on campus. the neighborhood itself wasn't bad at all. it was mostly other kids, elderly folks, and a few others here and there. everyone in the neighborhood was pretty relax and chill except for our fucking neighbors. we'll call them walter and jesse. now walter and jesse were brothers, and entrepreneurs of sorts. they ran a small, in-home business selling product in niche market that required very little advertisement. they were meth cooks and dealers. obnoxious, loud, violent, drug dealers. everyone hated them, but nobody would say anything about it due to the constant threats they would make while, strung out, from there front yard. we pretty much fell in line (at first). they would blast music and porn from there house from 7am until 7am. we'd hear screaming matches at there house that became full blown fights on their lawn. huge fucking parties that would go on for days. and to our chagrin, we ignored it all. well up arrives march, and my income tax comes in, i only get about $500, but goddammit, that's my $500 dollars and i'm gonna fucking buy something for me. everything has gone to college and bills and i want to splurge. i go out and buy a 42" lcd tv. it's a vizio, but it's the first hdtv i've ever had. my friends and i set it up, and oh boy did we have fun that week. and only that week, for that's as long as i had it. the meth bros decide they're gonna shoot their bb gun at whatever the fuck they can see. at birds, bushes, fences, and especially windows. well one little bb decided to go straight through my window and hit my tv, cracking it while i was playing some mw2. my face dropped and i heard laughing. which then immediately turned to death threats if i called the cops. now i know they had real guns. they had no issue showing them to anyone who looked at them. my friends and i were all disappointed at the turn of events. and both of them had submitted to not doing anything about it. but nay, not i. the one time i purchased me a bit of joy in my life (i grew up fairly poor), it was taken away from me. so i plotted. and i plotted. and i plotted some more. and an evil plot i did accomplish. i saved up every gatorade bottle i purchased for about 3 weeks. and every other day i would go to a different store and purchase pool cleaning tablets and rubbing alcohol at a different one, all with cash of course. now some of you might see what's going. and you'd be right. i had about 15 bottles saved up. and i made some spectacular chlorine gas bombs. i waited for a night when both of them were gone. it was about three in the morning so virtually everyone was asleep. i had prepared the gatorade bottles with the alcohol prior, so i started loading the tablets into the bottles and throwing them over the fence. since i didn't break down the tablets, it took a while for them to go off. i was able to get them all over the fence before the first one went boom. and boom they went. i go back inside and into my room. i hear them going off. boom. boom. one of my roommates wakes up and goes "what the fuck!?" boom. he wakes my other roommate (his room was closer) and there both freaking out. boom. time to put my game face on. i scramble on out of there and react visibly scared. boom. i look at them and tell them to call the cops. boom. boom. he calls 911 and tells the cops he hears explosions. i go outside and pretend to look like i'm trying to find out what's going on. boom. i tell my friend that it's coming from next door. boom. he tells me that the cops have already been sent to the area by a previous caller. boom. boom. i tell him there's a bunch of smoke coming from outside. boom. they tell us to stay inside. boom. the last one goes off. we close the doors and watch the mayhem unfold. right before the cops come, the heisenbros show up freaking out. right as they go inside about 3 cop cars show up and go through the front door. the officers haul them away and we go outside. they question us we tell them what we know. as far as the chlorine gas is concerned. it has already wafted into the atmosphere. they came back a couple days later and asked us questions specifically about the brothers. we told them what we heard about them and how they acted what they did. the officer left and that was the last time i talked about it. nobody knows about what i did but me. and it was the happiest we've been in a long time. the last i heard about them, they were doing hard time for their drug ring, being in possession of illegal firearms, and human trafficking suprisingly. edit: spelling**warning, long and written by a potato with shitty grammar** so this happened during the later stages of the 90's. 1998 to be exact, but i will not disclose the location, or names of the people involved so i can stay compliant with sub rules, as well as a non-disclosure clause i was made to sign after i successfully sued, and won, but more on that later. i was working for a business run by what appeared to be a normal, mom and pop type. after about a month or two of working there it became apparent these mom and pop owner, were in fact, real, shitty assholes. constant belittlement, ranting raving sessions for the slightest mistake, and absolutely cheap to bone when it came to wages. at the same time i was working two job (due to shitty wages) and at my other job there was a union drive happening. i was just out of high school back then, and did not know anything about unions, and the people who were organizing this did not educate anyone. they just threw a card in your face, told you to sign it, then left. i was not actually there for the card signing, i was hired just after the cards had been signed, and this was still a mystery to management. i literally was hired just before the shit hit the fan there. where i live, and at the time, labor laws were set up so 51% of the employees working at a business was all that was required to get a hearing before the labor board regarding certification. when 51% of the signed cards were received at the ministry, an application for certification was faxed to the senior management at the location, detailing all sorts of legal information, i am not sure of all the details. i do know that at that precise moment, no one could be fired, demoted, or have their wages changed, until after the hearing at the labor board where a decision would be made to accept, or reject the application for certification. by this point it turned into a lawyer show, with lawyers from the union and business slugging it out. this happens, the place goes ape shit, literally with middle management and union drivers in screaming matches, it was fucking chaos. but i was not there, i was at my other job, dealing with bullshit i usually dealt with, with the mom and pop operation. a month or two goes by, and the newly organized business settle downs, but there is anger, resentment, and hate bubbling under the surface. lines are being drawn, and you did not want to find yourself on the wrong side. but me, being a fresh faced 18 year old out of high school, and not knowing what the fuck was going on, chose to side with the friendly "manager" who hired me. after all, it was him who gave me my shot, not the organizers of union drive, and the union organizers did nothing to educate me, just threatened me with not wanting to be on the wrong side of the line when the everything was finalized. if i haven't lost you yet, i want to take a moment to say, for the record, i am not anti-union. i am much older now, and time has given me perspective, and i don't always agree with labor, but i know a strong labor movement is healthy as well, another debate, for another time... well the day comes when the pickets go up, and this being a smaller town, the fucking media is there as well. i left my other mom and pop shitty job, and came to work at the newly unionized business i was recently hired at. not knowing what to do, i chose to cross the picket line and go to work. the results of that were to be placed in a group of socially undesirable after the pickets were down, and business resumed. meanwhile, i continue working, both jobs, the mom and pop job getting more and more insufferable each day. most of the workers at the union job won't talk to me, and all this bullshit, from both sides is really beginning to take its toll on a sensitive, dumb as shit, 18 year old kid that just wanted to work, smoke pot, and get laid. then i have an idea! i am done with the mom and pop job, and their fucking bullshit. if a union drive can happen at the one place, why not here? also, and i am littering giggling like a little asian girl at this idea. why don't i get the same union that i crossed at my other job, to unionize this place, and get back in their good graces again? so i call up the guy who lead the original organizing drive, and after a three hour session of coffee and note pads. he agrees to help me out, and the next day i started to hand out cards at the mom and pop business. the union business agents i dealt with could not be involved at this point. legally, the signing of the cards had to be done of everyone's free will, and it had to been brought forth by an employee, not a union rep. they supported me, coached me daily on how i should tackle the problems that were arising, but they would not show up at the business until after the application for certification was officially registered at the ministry. they were adamant about this, but assured me, they would be there, guns ready the moment it happened. well, i got my revenge on these petty, power mad mom and pop losers. the union drive took its toll on all of us, but in the end i could not get enough people to sign, and i was fired. i called the union business agents, and they told me not to worry. the drive was dead, but they were going to sue my former employer on my behalf. what i never told the union was, i always knew the union would fail. it was a smaller business compared to the place where i had crossed the line. the dynamics were way different, and i knew the people at this business, the mom and pop business, really didn't give two shits either way. but this was a way to legally get back at the owners of the mom and pop, and clean my reputation with the union at the same time. this was a small town, and even know i was a dumb 18 year old, i knew this was the kind of thing that would follow me around for ever. i wanted to be on the right side of the union, if i ever needed them in the future. so the union sued them, and won. i got a small settlement out of it, not much money,more satisfaction, and i regained by rep with the union which helped me out many later. tldr got treated like shit, and cross a picket line, figured out a way to get back at the people who treated me like shit, and regain my rep with the union who's line crossed. *edit* for spelling on to the story, i'll try and keep it short. around 2pmedt today i received a call from a collections agency, i'd been seeing this number pop up random times everyday. so, i decided to answer the phone. collections asshole(ca from here on) got short with me when i requested detailed information and then hung up on me when i asked for his full name. cue the *you don't call me wanting money with no explanation and then hang up on me when i start questioning your claims to my money. so i called back, took 4 calls before i got a hold of a supervisor. i finally managed to pry the info out of the supervisor and find out this collection is for a hospital bill i don't even owe. argument ensues with me telling him i'm refusing to lay $675 for a hospital visit i never even had been to. he keeps threatening me with small claims and yada yada, but i managed to get the company address(a po box in buffalo, ny) and the number they were calling from was routed through nc. i looked around and couldn't find an actual company listed under the po box or anything related to the phone number. nothing, no company name, no physical address for the office they're calling from(i know they aren't all working from a po box, obviously. so i get suspicious and call up my attorney with the info i've found. he informs me he's going to have a look and call me back. around 3pm he calls to inform me that this "collections" agency buy outdated alright. small midwestern "hick town" bar. a couple of friends and i stopped in to have a drink and watch some live music. one of my friends, who we call fat paul (in the most affectionate way ever, you'd just have to be there) sits down on a wrought iron bench outside the place, in front of a big glass window. well, "fat paul" sat down a little too hard in the seat and it taps the window behind it a little too hard...... causing the window, which is about, oh, 6 feet tall and 3 feet wide, to shatter and drop out of the frame all over the patio. on the other side of this window was a large liquor cabinet, and the music was loud inside, so nobody noticed. while we were sitting there, staring wide-eyed at each other going "what the fuck do we do?", this....... extremely drunk, corn fed midwest bar fly comes staggering out, cigarette in hand. the woman is the total stereotype that you're imagining - too much makeup and hairspray, old, saggy, faded tattooed, etc. sounded like freakin tom waits when she talked. and she had an incredibly nasty (maybe even psychotic) attitude, to boot. she comes over and asks for a lighter (never noticing the window) and starts making passes at us all and trying to get us to buy her a drink. after a few more cigarettes the shtick started getting old, and after about the fifth time of her grabbing ahold of my arm and trying to pull me into the bar, i say "look, dude. stop fucking pulling on me, jesus christ i'm out here trying to smoke!" this causes a white trash nuclear meltdown. this drunken dolly parton caricature starts screaming and calling us all "motherfuckers" and yelling at us to "get the fuck out of my bar". something about this shrill, slurring ranting must have pierced the din better than the shattered window, because the bouncer comes outside pretty quickly. when he asks us what is going on, the woman starts to say something and my buddy fat paul cuts her off and tells the bouncer: "i dunno, man, she came out here drunk as fuck and screaming and yelling, and then she bashed out that window right there!" dude totally believed us, called the cops and everything. we went ahead and split at that point, but he was pretty intent on keeping the woman there. i always like to imagine she was arrested. bitch. haha.so back in the early days of high school i used to play a lot of xbox live, and i'd usually play together with my friends whom i knew in real life, and one guy who we only knew through the internet but were pretty good friends with anyways. at first i had no problem with any of these people but after a while i couldn't help but notice how much more often that a couple of them would generally just single me out and act dickish towards me, always trying to make me look stupid or an asshole, and always trying to turn the group against me. they mostly did this because they wanted to look cool in front of the rest of the group, and thought of me as an easy target for some reason. one was this kid i knew in real life but wasn't really friends with (andy), and the other was the kid who we only knew online (dave). for some reason these two were really good friends though, probably because they were too insecure for real life friends. after a while of silently taking their bullshit one day i finally decided i'd had enough and it was time to strike back. the thing about andy was that he was a compulsive liar. like seriously lied about the most mundane shit and would never, ever, admit that he was lying, despite how blatantly obvious it was. i think part of the reason why he didn't like me is because i would always call him out on his pathetic lies. now, andy had a particular lie that he always clung to, which was that he had a girlfriend, but that the reason we never met her was because she lived in new zealand, and they we're in a long distance relationship, although she didn't have a phone and that they only talked through the internet. it was obvious that he was lying because he could never keep his story straight and the excuses he would make when you really had him backed into a corner were just straight up laughable. he even went as far as to make a fake facebook account for her with a picture he took from the internet and only had literally two facebook friends; andy and dave. eventually i pressured him enough about it that one day he claimed that he and his alleged girlfriend had "broken up" and that i could stop harassing him about it. now keep in mind that andy would never admit his lies, not even to his best friend dave who for some inexplicable reason was too dumb to realize he was a compulsive liar. one of the reasons dave was convinced that she existed was because he "talked to her" on facebook a few times and hit it off pretty well. when i learned this i immediately realized my opportunity and from another friend of ours i happened to get my hands on dave's phone number and this is where the fun really began. i sent him a text message letting him know that it was zoey (the name of andy's supposed ex-girlfriend), and that her father had finally let her get a cell phone. after a bit of back of forth flirtatious texting and "hitting it off" we developed a romantic relationship and we'd text message all the time and tell each other our secrets (mine were made up of course) and he'd tell me all sorts of shit fully believing that we had a serious thing going on. and of course, andy was "totally cool with it" because even though he had no clue who the fuck dave was really talking to, he simply could not admit that she didn't exist, so he just had no choice but to go along with it too, which was hilarious. after a while i knew so much intimate shit about this kid and he really opened up and trusted me. i even sent him "dirty pics", which was really just forearm by my elbow folded to look like a pussy which he really *really* enjoyed if you know what i mean. i almost requested something from him to blackmail him with, but realized that would open up a whole other can of legal trouble and i left it alone. so after about a month of this, while quietly taking their abuse over xbox, i finally decided i had enough. one day they particularly got on my nerves so in the xbox party chat in front of every one of our friends i just began reading off our intimate text messages and all the shit he told me, as he slowly began to piece together what was happening. dave went dead silent and turned off his xbox. i then proceeded to undoubtedly prove once and for all to the rest of my friends that this girl was 100% fake because andy was going along with it the whole time, acting like she was real, yet it was me, therefore it was clear he was lying the whole time. the best part was that it really destroyed andy and dave's friendship in a way that never really healed because they couldn't trust each after andy had knowingly let dave have relations with a complete stranger. i also found out from one of our mutual friends that david was so upset about it that it made him depressed and at times he couldn't even eat food it fucked with him so bad. needless to say i never really had a problem with either of them trying to fuck with me after that. in fact, they both hated me so much that they refused to even be in the same xbox party with me ever again. they could no longer truly fit in our group of friends because as long as i was playing they wouldn't and at last the problem was solved. when i had to make up a credit in summer school i sat beside a skinny little weed dealer, harmless spaceman. this kid arrived at school very day with a new bruise or bump and it turned out he was being beaten by a giant and very stupid goon until he turned over his weed. half way through the course i contracted a wicked case of poison ivy and the skinny spaceman asked me where i had contracted it. after i told him he smiled and got this dreamy, far away look in his eyes. the following monday the spaceman came to school undamaged and un-mussed. giant, stupid, goon did not come at all. spaceman had rolled some poison ivy into a few joints and let goon take them from him. goon never came back to class and did not write the exam. stone cold spaceman. edit: i had no idea what spaceman was planning to do and i doubt he really thought it through. i never saw the goon again or spaceman after the exam. this all happened in the mid 70's.right, felt like sharing this with you guys as it's kind of your forte. anyway, few years back, i was working as a hotel receptionist. we were a hotel of about 75 rooms so roughly 150-190 capacity and we just so happened to have the bulk of 2 weddings guests staying with us. needless to say, we were busy and seeing as it was just us two on, we manned the bar and reception (they were joint). one wedding had a lot of these rich, smarmy, silver spoon in mouths type of people. they weren't all dicks in their party, some of them were genuinely nice interesting people who were behaving politely and well behaved. it was for this reason that we kept the bar open for them. anyway, as the night starts to wind down, people are going to bed, we shut the bar, people are fine with this...except one. this one smarmy prick who wanted everyone to know his upper class status, his wealth, what car he drove. ergh. so, we tell him that we will not be serving any more alcohol and that the bar is closed. nope, he didn't like that. demands that it be left open, and that he has spent loads of money to demand this (the guy spent £75 on a room, and about £30-40 on beer, not earth shattering amounts seeing as people had spent far more than that). we politely tell him to retire to his room. nope again. this time he squares up to my friend. at this point, i should note that my friend is a licensed doorman and ex military, so he can handle himself. my friend proceeds to tell mr. high society that he will need to return to his room or vacate the hotel. nope. he pushes my friend. i call the police as we couldn't kick the guy out of the hotel and let him wander around as the hotel was on a roundabout which was in between 2 busy roads and it would be irresponsible. the guy knowing he's fucked up just sits there all quiet whilst we wait for the police. the police arrive and arrest the guy for being drunk and disorderly. here's the juicy part. they put the guy in the back of police car and talk to myself and my friend. whilst we're talking, we here this strange noise over the policemans shoulder radio. that noise turns into some screaming to be let out. yup, scared the crap out of all of us. so we all turn around and posh boy is holding the in car radio, screaming at the top of his voice. yup, police weren't impressed. so they cuff him and station the other officer with him. they finish with us and they're about to leave, when they find the dirty bastard is laughing his head off at pissing himself on the back seat of the police car. so. much. win. because of this guy not wanting to go to bed, he landing himself with an £80 drunk and disorderly charge, unsolicited use of police coms, criminal damage, and the cost to clean. and to add icing on the cake, when his friends come down the next morning to check out and ask where he is and if we checked him out already, we tell them all what happened. and they laughed their arses off. oh, and we found £20 on the floor where he was sitting. fin. tl;dr bar shuts, guy gets abusive to staff, police called, makes more trouble for himself by fucking with their radios, pisses himself, permanent criminal record, public humiliation by his friends when i was in middle school (mainly 6th-7th grade) things called paper wasps were insanely popular among everybody. basically, all you had to do to make one was take a piece of paper and shape it in an arrow, then you flung it at someone else with a rubber band. they hurt like hell. unfortunately, since i was quite unpopular, i would get attacked by these on a regular basis, especially on the bus when no teacher was around (the bus driver didn't do shit). most of them came from a kid we'll call seth. he sat at the back of the bus (where all the popular kids sat) and would always shoot them at the back of my head when i wasn't looking. when i would try to confront him about it, he would blame the many kids sitting in the area and continue once my head was turned. starting in the middle of sixth grade, this went on until my seventh grade year was nearly finished. i tried everything to stop it. the principal came on the bus one day to try to deter anyone from shooting them, telling us that the bus driver would report anyone who shot them. this helped for a few months, but after a while the attacks would begin again. shooting these things at me was a favorite past time among everybody, and soon seth wasn't the only kid who would be doing it. even though i didn't like it, i had barely any friends and i sort of made myself believe that this was their way of accepting me into their circle. then this happened in art class one day in seventh grade, which made me believe otherwise. i was minding my own business while at the same time looking at seth and his group who were huddled in one corner of the room. this made me anxious, because it didn't look like they were doing their project. i spotted a few of them (of a group of 12 or so) looking at me and laughing. i figured they were planning something, so i was planning on excusing myself from the class once i finished the project (we weren't allowed to leave the room long-term otherwise). but just as i was about to turn my work in, seth casually gets up (which gets me more anxious) and before i can react he takes out a rubber band and shoots a wasp in the worst place a guy can be hit in. yup. i obviously don't react lightly to this, and crumple to the floor while the whole class bursts out in laughter. the teacher tries to calm everyone down, but even when she does this the damage is done. seth and the rest of his buddies get sent out of the room, and while on the floor i realize that what he hit me with wasn't paper. this was a completely different material, later dubbed "metal wasps". i forget what they actually made it from, but they stung so hard that i had to keep myself from crying, which would make the whole ordeal even worst. because of the embarrassment, i got my parents to take me home, where i planned my much-needed revenge on seth, who made my school life a living hell. on the way home, i made my mom stop at the store where i would get the supplies for my revenge. i bought dozens of rubber bands and paper, along with the material that was used for the metal wasps (i don't think it was actually metal, though). i spent the rest of the day practicing my aim, and before the days end, i had it. unfortunately, i couldn't take out my plan the very next day, because seth and his cronies got suspended for three days. but that meant i had plenty more time to practice. when the day finally came for seth's return, i stuffed my bag with dozens of rubber bands, and paper/metal wasps--all of which were intended for seth. the day went on as usual, but every time i would be picked on (mostly by seth) i would just imagine the satisfaction i would get once i had pulled this off. then it finally came. i admit, i was nervous. i never did anything this malicious before, and i feared i would get in trouble. but i decided it didn't matter, and readied the rubber band and paper wasp, turning around. seth was talking to a popular eighth grade girl who we'll call kelly. no one really noticed me--they were doing their own thing, but i focused on seth, who was really enjoying his conversation with kelly. then i fired. and i got it in his eye. i stared at him dumbstruck. i didn't mean to get it in his eye--i was actually aiming for the side of his face. and then he started balling, crying really hard. i didn't move at all, still stayed in the same position, so someone eventually figured out that it was me that did it. i eventually got out of my stupor and carried out my original plan, firing dozens of paper and metal wasps, and all of them hit seth. not one of his friends stopped me, laughing as he cowered from my wasps. as this was going on, kelly laughed along with them for a short while before going back to her friends, who were all popular, and paid us no attention. the laughter and weeping seth was enough to annoy the bus driver, and eventually i was kicked off the buss a few blocks from my stop. before i walked off, the bus driver said in seth's defense, "you shouldn't pick on people who are weaker than you," which made me and everyone else laugh even harder. literally the whole buss cheered as i walked off. the best part? after the fact, seth tried to get me in trouble with the school, but he was ignored because they know very well that seth picked on me. and i'm a good kid. i wouldn't do a thing like that (i have no idea if they tried to contact the bus driver or not, but the school sided with me). they thought that seth asked one of his friends (who didn't side with him, thankfully) to do that to him. he got detention for trying to get me in trouble. tl;dr: bully terrorizes me for over a year. i give him a taste of his own medicine and humiliate him in front of all his friends.on a fine summer's day in sleepy old melbourne, i drove off from the lights at a reasonable rate. fuckwit driving next to me then decides that he must be in front of me when the road turns into a single lane, and cuts me off, forcing me to brake sharply. i did not take kindly to this. i flash my lights, he flips me off. well played, fuckwit. however, i also flipped him off in a spectacular display of both maturity and creativity. the road then becomes two lanes at the next set of traffic lights. i am in left lane, fuckwit in the right. the lights turn green, and i floor it. unsurprisingly, fuckwit and his v8 ute take this as a direct insult to his manhood - he must be faster. so he goes past me, but i do not give up. quickly, we are 20km/h over the speed limit of 60km/h. approaching another intersection, i quickly brake down to 60km/h. victorious, fuckwit shoots through the intersection. the intersection that i knew had a fixed speed camera. suck it. tl;dr shitcunt dangerously cuts me off, i get him to speed through a speed camera.i figured after my more heavy and dramatic revenge story, i would post a much more lighthearted one where i actually do more than just walk away. tl;dr down the bottom this happened a while ago, but a post on the front page of reddit reminded me of it. back in august 2012 i started doing my certificate iii in networking at uni. the classroom was always noisy because of this particular group of classmates. it happened with every teacher except the ones that wouldn't take their crap (the big teacher who straight out kicked them out, and well, the head teacher) during other classes they were really loud and annoying and this is when i'm trying to do my weekly tests (and sometimes resitting, and studying for resits since i failed the first times). it was very very frustrating and difficult to concentrate. anyone who has done networking will understand it's a lot to take in. it would happen every week. every time i would mention it to the other two teachers, ones response was *"oh, but its nice to have some noise, the other classes are so quiet"*, and the other teacher was this socially awkward teacher with a lisp who didn't really do anything about it. so every time toward the last quarter of these classes, these annoying students would fuck around and browse whatever they want, laughing about all the stuff they're seeing and what they're going to do after class, and since i'm a slow learner i generally would still be doing my work and asking the teacher for assistance. i had previously spoken to these annoying students, but they never really listened. now it pays to mention these pushover teachers are in their late 40s early 50s. their hearing isn't that great, and to be honest, neither is mine. i had discovered this application that allowed me to play really high pitch noises. i even showed it to my classmates during one of my classes where everyone was discussing work. so they knew i had it. in reality i wasn't just showing it to them, i was gauging what levels they could hear it where i couldn't. i think this was around... 14000hz-16000hz. at levels they could hear it, it was piercing, it was playing with their heads and they **really** wanted me to turn it off. i'm not *as* bothered by it when i hear it, so i don't quite understand, but i oblige. an intense feeling of happiness washed over me. justice was going to get served. i was ready, i had my nifty little gadget to get my revenge in my pocket. i felt like batman. skip forward a few days and we're in **[socially awkward teacher's]** class. of course, the douchebag classmates start being rowdy toward the end of the class when i'm still studying and getting work done while i'm at the class computer. this is when i take out my secret weapon. i turn my phone speakers up, and blast the tone at 15000hz. occasionally making it go up and down by a bit, to produce different pitches. i then call the teacher over for help with a subject. the teacher **cannot** hear it. it was a success, the most subtle type of revenge and i was doing it right in front of the teacher. as the teacher is helping me i can hear the comments of the the douche classmates on the other side of the room. douchebag 1: **ahh i fuckin hate that noise thing aye** douchebag 2: **its so annoying!** douchebag 3: **fuck lets go** they then left the classroom and i was left in peace to study. for a few weeks i did this until i think they finally got the hint. it didn't matter though, once the term was over i switched classes into a class where i had people i actually liked. **tl;dr** classmates are annoying to me in class when im trying to study, i don't have the best hearing, i find a high frequency tone generator and blast it at a tone that me and my teacher cannot hear. they get angry and leave. i get to study in peace. end.i went to a friend's house to set up his surprise going away party and a man i had only ever heard of in passing opened the door. we shake hands and introduce ourselves. let's call him richard. upon hearing my name, richard says, "oh, right, elephant, you're the epileptic! so you have seizures when i go like this?" and proceeded to flip the lights on and off. now, it wasn't yet dark enough and he wasn't doing it fast enough for it to actually set off a seizure, but the thing about seizures is that people can literally die from them, so as soon as the first moment of panic passed and i remember that, i was *pissed.* so i punched him in the face hard enough to break his nose in full view of everyone else. somebody called the police, but no one else there was an asshole and some of them had seen me seizing before (mostly absence seizures, but i've been told that those can be more terrifying to witness than tonic-clonic seizures). so when the police came and i made up a story about how i had had a seizure because of something richard did to try to set off a seizure, they backed me up and said that i wouldn't have known what i was doing. so they lectured richard and escorted both of us to the hospital. edit: formattingi posted this on /r/pettyrevenge a long time ago from my old account. at that time i don't think /r/prorevenge existed. here is the story: this happened almost 15 years ago. the year was 2001 and i was in my junior year of college. there was a hate site called dalitstan.org. it was an anti-india/anti-hindu site that contained lots of literature and posts against hindus and indians. i don't remember how i came across the site, but originally i just thought it was a regular discussion forum and i joined it. soon i realized that the people on there were pretty much insane, and so full of hatred that there was no way to convince them. once they found out i was indian *and* hindu, i started getting hate messages. eventually they just banned me. i then decided to harass them by creating troll accounts and spamming the board. they reacted by blocking my accounts. so i'd create a new one and restart the cycle. this was getting tiring so being a cs major i decided to automate the process. since this was in 2001, there was very little by way of cross-site-scripting protection, or captchas, or any of that. you could copy the code for their submission form, and submit a post from a local file! the first thing i did was to create a simple script that would spam the board from a single account. they would ban that user and then i would create a new one. they knew it was me and one of them even threatened to "send a letter to my university", which i laughed off because they had no idea where i was. i lay low for a few days to give them false comfort and then i decided to spam them right. the board's user-registration form didn't have any protection either. so i wrote a script that did the following: - register a random username. - spam the message board for a random amount of time. - repeat. this way if they blocked the user, another user would start up in a little while. i finished the script at around 10 or 11 at night, so i started it up and went to bed. next morning i checked their site... and i found over **10,000 to 20,000** spam messages on their message board! they were freaking out and talking about being "hacked". they had also blocked all posts to the forum except for a few users, and had started cleaning up the spam. after they cleaned it up, they cautiously opened up posting to all users again. i didn't bother them for a week and they thought they were in the clear. then bam! i started up the script again. this time i had multiple instances of the script running, so up to 4-5 bots were posting at the same time. the next morning there were around 50,000-60,000 posts in *all* of their sub forums. the forum was pretty much unusable. they couldn't even post because every legitimate new post would be drowned out by the spam posts. they then made the forum invite-only, but there was still a shit ton of spam to clean up. i checked in on the site from time to time to find it pretty much dead. they were still trying to clean up the spam and there were no new users or posters since it was invite-only. they never quite recovered and after a week or two the site went down. i like to think that i had something to do with that. :) tl;dr; i stumble across a forum. i start posting only to discover that they are racist fucktards. i get banned. i use my l33t hax0r skills to spam them into oblivion. site never recovers and goes dark.years ago i worked as a truck driver, even owned my own trucks for a while. one of the companies i used to trip lease to had several different divisions. called them up one day to see if they had freight. was told they couldn't load me till i talked to joe (not his real name) joe was in charge of safety, which includes driver records. little background on joe, is an asshole. he played favorites to the guys who worked out of the same terminal as he did. he and i went round and round a few times. back story. i called him up and he won't tell me anything on the phone. says i have to come see him in person and they can't load me till i do. i blew him off since i had about 15 other companies i was trip leasing to at the time. fast forward a week. i happen to be in the area on personal business and i stop in to see him. he is especially nice, which should have tipped me off that something was up. he keeps me waiting about 20 minutes, finally get to talk to him. tells me he can't load me because my license was under suspension. tell him i'll take care of it. go out get in the car and just as i leave the property i get pulled over. the bastard set me up, that was why he kept me waiting 20 minutes. gave the state police time to get there. they arrested me and took me to jail, on a friday evening. didn't get to see the magistrate till monday. payed my fines, payed my reinstatement fees and went on my way. now i realize that it was my fault for not paying the fine. to be honest, i got three tickets that day, when i mailed them in 2 weeks later i missed one of them. at that time i was working pretty much 7 days a week. all my mail not that there was much of it, was going to my brothers house. my brother failed to let me know he had mail there from the state. joe could have simply told me about it so i could have taken care of it. but no the fucker got me arrested. i sat on this for 8 or 9 years. one day i'm out in the truck and see one of their trucks from joe's terminal. i get on the cb radio and call out to him. me : hey abc trucking, you got your radio on? abc: go ahead. me: does joe still work there? abc: yeah he does, why? me: that asshole fucked me a while back, tell him i haven't forgotten about him. abc: no shit? what did he do now? me: can't tell you, it could possibly reveal my identity. but you tell that bastard i know where he lives, i know where his wife shops, i know where his daughters go to collage, i even know where they sleep at night. tell him he fucked with the wrong person. abc: i'll pass it on. i kept this routine up every time i saw one of their trucks. about the 4th one i ran into told me joe was shitting his pants. had pulled his girls out of collage. wouldn't let them or his wife go anywhere without an escort. was driving different vehicles to work. made his wife change her shopping habits all the time. i pretty much completely disrupted their lives. next truck i saw i told him to tell joe that having his wife and daughters escorted around wasn't going to help him. pretty much i kept him running scared on and off for 2 years or so. i always took information one driver would give me and use it in my next conversation with another driver. so joe thought some one was always watching him. even though i hadn't seen him since the day he got me arrested. i did find out that he became less of an asshole after that. amazing story a good friend just posted about bonding with her father: my father is a shy and quiet man. growing up, he and i weren’t close. he didn’t quite understand my overly dramatic responses to everything. we didn’t “connect” on any level. the only time he generally spoke to me was when he was angry with me because i was arguing with my mom. however, when i was 11, i was able to form a special secret bond with my father. we did a very bad thing, and then kept the secret from my mother, and in my mind, the authorities. this secret (which will now no longer be a secret) has bonded us together ever since. to this day, we still talk about the time when we practically broke the law. my dad still beams with pride, as if it was his crowning moment. it’s a story i treasure because it’s ours. sunday was obligatory church day in our house. my mother taught sunday school, my brother attended sunday school, i sang in the children’s choir and my dad was a deacon or some such ranking official. after church, my mother would stay in town and pick up greeting cards at the hallmark store or refill prescriptions. on this particular sunday, my parents had driven separately to church so my father wouldn’t have to partake in card shopping. my brother was going with my mom. i weighed my options and decided to forego shopping and hopped in my father’s pickup truck. “we have to stop off at the shop.” my father said. my father was the owner and operator of the town’s only garbage removal company, waste-away disposal service (“a refuse you can’t offer”). we didn’t have city-funded garbage service in our tiny village, and my father had trucks, employees, a shop/garage, offices, and he also managed the city dump. as a child, i was always embarrassed of his work. kids would pick on me about being a garbage picker or “always having enough to eat.” later in life, i would come to appreciate the financial benefits to being the daughter of a “garbage picker” and have since been quite proud of my father’s business. as we pulled up to the shop, i noticed two garbage trucks parked in front of the garage. my dad immediately started swearing. “that fucking son of a bitch! i’m god damned tired of his bullshit! he’s stealing from me. seven fucking dollars a month and he’s stealing from me! god damned son of a bitch!. emily, get in the god damned garbage truck!” this was probably more words than my father had ever spoken to me, and the first time i’d heard him say the “f” word. i was alarmed. as i climbed in the garbage truck, my father explained. an angry guy who lived around the corner refused to pay his garbage bill, and had gotten upset with my father about the fee of $7.00 a month for garbage service. after some yelling, he promptly cancelled his service with my father. then, the guy started sneaking his garbage over to the shop at night and throwing it in the back of the garbage trucks that weren’t parked inside. he was, in fact, stealing from my father. my father continued on to say the guy wasn’t terribly smart as he always threw away his mail with his name and address and was easily identified. as we pulled up, he had noticed new garbage thrown in the back of the truck (not compressed) including letters and magazines. “i’ve had 6 conversations with that guy about throwing his garbage in here. i told him i was going to take him to court if he didn’t quit.” i didn’t know what was going on, but i was quite afraid of how angry my dad was. i’d never seen that part of him before. i thought maybe we were going to drive over to the guy’s house and fight him. i was truly scared of what might happen because i didn’t consider my dad a good fighter; he was too shy and nice. my dad backed the full garbage truck onto the street and turned the corner. we soon pulled up to a ranch style home with a sizeable front yard. i could only assume this was angry guy’s house, but i was still completely unsure what my dad had in mind. instead of pulling into the driveway, my father swore a few more times and backed the garbage truck through the front yard, stopping precisely at the moment the back of the truck touched the cement set of porch stairs. there were deep tire tracks in the grass and mud troughs had formed where grass once grew. crime 1: destruction of property. i was only able to observe what was going on outside through the side mirror, but from inside the truck, i noticed my father pushing buttons and pulling levers. then i realized what was happening. my father was dumping the entire garbage truck filled with trash onto the man’s front steps and porch. this was all the trash that truck had picked up and compacted in a day. this was much much more than angry man’s trash. it was half the town’s trash! as we pulled away, my father exclaimed, “i bet he doesn’t dump his garbage in my trucks again!” i looked back as we drove off to see a mountain and a half of garbage propped perfectly in front of the house, piled high on the cement patio. the wrought iron railing held it all neatly in place and the front door was no longer visible behind the wall of refuse. crime 2: littering , crime 3: front yard invasion i kept imagining angry guy walking out his front door in his bathrobe, bleary-eyed and searching for his sunday paper, only to find a mountain of trash he would have no way of removing. i imagined him taking a few seconds to realize who had done the deed and then calling the police to have us arrested. my dad just smiled. i think he was imagining the man in his bathrobe standing in a pile of garbage too. then, in typical father-form, my father said, “don’t tell your mother. that was probably illegal.” in that instant, i knew i was special. my dad trusted me with his illegal activities, and now i had something in common with him, a connection i’d never had before. although i was somewhat horrified of the whole incident, i was excited to have something to talk about with my dad when i visited him in jail. i also was secretly proud that my dad was such a badass. we quickly drove back to the shop and got into my dad’s pickup and headed home. i was speechless and my father was too busy beaming to say a word. when we arrived 4 minutes later, i didn’t look my mother in the eye. i feared she would see the crimes written in my pupils. i knew the police would soon be taking me away. based on what i had learned about jail from tv, i determined i was an accomplice. i’d most likely be going to jail for 10-15 years and my father would certainly get life. i tried not to cry as i sat on the couch searching out the window, waiting for the police to come. i was afraid for weeks, always fearful when a car pulled down our street. the police never came and my father and i kept our secret. one day, years later he told me the guy started coming to the dump religiously after that and paid to dump his trash there instead. he never said a word to my dad about the mountain of trash and apparently no witnesses ever put me at the scene of the crime. now, every time i bring up that story, my dad laughs so hard he cries. he’s still so proud of the day he took down the man who stole from him. he always finishes the story with, “he never did dump his trash in my trucks again.” then, he always says, between tears, ”i guess we really did have a refuse he couldn’t offer.” i never did understand that slogan, but i too laugh until i cry just the same. i think this deserves to be here because this revenge took an epic 7 years to exact. for context, i moved across the world when i was 11. in my country of original citizenship, i started a year early and skipped a grade, so if i had continued along this path, i would be graduating high school at the age of 16. i moved to australia, and because i had almost finished 7th grade but i was young, i was told i needed to be evaluated to check my competency. fair enough, i guess - my family expected as much. what we didn't expect, however, was the school counselor. he 'evaluated' me, asked some questions, and then spoke to my mother afterwards. he decided that i should be put into 6th grade (which was just starting, due to start date of the school year) even though i was about halfway through 7th grade. i believe his exact words were "spaghetti is very eloquent, which makes him appear more intelligent than he actually is." pretty crushing thing for a 10 year old to hear. you aren't actually that smart, you just sound smart. so here goes mate, i'm going to prove you as wrong as i possibly can. i'm going to be the best damn 6th grader you've ever seen in yo life. fast forward to senior year of high school, and it's college application time. i've been invited into several extended programs, and as a result, i've finished two semesters of university mathematics, and one of physics. this counselor meets with all students individually to discuss college plans (or lack thereof), so he knew i was looking into international programs - specifically, cambridge, yale and harvard. several weeks after our initial meeting, he approaches me about a program that's being established in the middle east; american campuses expanding into international waters. the school had been invited to nominate a student, and he had chosen me because of my stellar grades, tenacity, and motivation to explore different options. my mother and i were invited in to discuss this possibility after i realized i was going to apply. i had already written my essays and needed to discuss some logistics as a nominated student (him signing off as the nominator, references from faculty etc.) i will never forget the expression on his face when my mum asked him if he remembered the last time they had met. "i remember you!" she said. "we met about 7 years ago. do you recall what you said about spaghetti?" he shakes his head. "oh, you told me he was eloquent and appeared smart, but wasn't actually that smart. isn't it funny that you're nominating him for this now?" ringing dead silence, and he goes bright red. for the record, i was accepted to the program (a liberal arts college with a sub 2% acceptance rate) and i'm lucky enough to study and live all over the world. spaghetti: 1. counselor: 0. “the best revenge is massive success.” - frank sinatrathis story happened a while back when i was in uni. back then i was studying overseas and lived with my brother who had a driver's license and a car. we both went to the same school so i regularly hitched rides from him. the uni has a whole car park dedicated for students, however as we both attend the largest faculty, we usually had to arrive early for a spot or you would just end up circling for an eternity trying to find one. one morning we arrived fairly close to our lecture time and were desperately trying to find a park. we eventually spotted someone pulling out of a lot, and we signalled our parking intentions, and waited behind the lot. as the car pulled out and engaged the drive gear, this fucking prick takes advantage of the fact the driver was heading in our direction, and zips into the lot as we had to wait for the original driver to driver off. incensed, we let rip with the horn and told him exactly what we thought of his behaviour. this prick then proceeds to exit his car grinning at us, before flipping the bird and dashing off to class. extremely pissed and running late, we had no choice but to circle the carpark again and pray we got lucky. and you know what? we did get lucky! we found a spot within a minute and decided that this fucking prick was going to pay. so my brother and i headed back to the pricks car, with revenge on our minds. now the pricks car was an old bomb, which probably meant that he didn't have a lot of money. this is important because we figured that if we let out all the air in his tyres, he wouldn't have the means to tow it somewhere to get the air pumped back in. thus with my brother acting as a look out, i slowly deflated all the air in all four tyres. rendering me late for class but grinning like a fool as a entered. my lecturer was not impressed. i left uni that day, and forgot about the incident until the end of the week, when i next had class. as me and my brother arrived, we saw that the pricks car was still there in the same lot! this made me burst out laughing and i gave my brother a quick fist bump, creating an impromptu tradition each time we saw his car. this carried on for the entire month, as the pricks car started to collect parking tickets and was eventually presumably towed away. it was the most satisfying revenge i ever had.hey prorevenge, it's been a minute. but i'm back with a new story that happened last night. okay, so i am a bouncer. proof: username. tl;dr terrorist supporters come into the bar. i throw them out. they wanna fight. good ole boy from alabama starts his wwe debut. titties and freedom. so a little background. i work at a bar in a college town. the dancefloor is outside, and the entrance leads to an inside part. the university is famous because it has a large percentage of foreign students. i've backpacked through europe and i have a lot of foreign friends, so i think it's fantastic. mostly because a lot of them are 6 foot 8 swiss volleyball girls that like to get drunk and dance promiscuously on the stage, but i digress. well recently at the bar we have been having a large group of fellas who happen to dislike america coming in. from what i have gathered watching them for several weeks throughout the night, these guys like to flex their wealth and so called superiority more than anyone. they spend hundreds at the bar every night and tend to get pretty rowdy near the end of the night. that happens with a lot of people, so it doesn't bother me usually. but these assholes like to run their mouths about how much they hate america and how isis will win after they get drunk and they end up starting shit. i'm not looking to get stabbed in a bar, so i don't appreciate that. i'm not gonna throw them out for that though, freedom of speech is the definition of america no matter how much i disagree with what they are saying. they can write their own death warrant in front of all these rednecks if they want to. i usually have to throw a few of them out when they come while they scream unintelligibly at me and tell me how they will whoop my ass and kill me. normal family fun. they never resist me when i am kicking them out though, i usually just have to push them with one hand and they leave. pussies. not last night. well this weekend, everyone from my town is celebrating mardi gras in new orleans, so the bar was not nearly as packed as it usually is. these aformentioned group of guys came in in about a group of 10. there were no football players, or fraternity guys there that night, so they were the big ballers even more than they usually think they are. at about 1:15 two of these dudes start pushing each other and yelling at each other pretty violently. i jump off of the stage and rip them apart from each other. well the taller of the pair(who will be known as af for ass face) wore his big boy pants that night because he yelled "fuck you you american fuck!" and took a swing at me. he was pretty drunk and all i had to do was lean back a little to make him miss. i immediately put him in a headlock, as i usually do. well. his posse doesn't like this. they don't like this at all, and they're all really drunk. so they start to circle up around me. this doesn't pose a huge problem because i'm a big dude, and they are not. i push through them as i'm getting yelled at in what i was told was urdu, and get af inside. well working the door inside is my coworker d-wreck. d-wreck is a good ole boy from alabama. d-wreck is very pro-violence. well i get af inside and the bar starts clapping. "you outta here mother fucker!" "you fucked up now!" my boss sees me coming and throws open the double doors so i can throw this dude outside. leading up to the bar we have a ramp with guardrails on it. this will become relevant soon. well as soon as i push af out the doors he turns on me 0 to 100 nigga real quick. now it would be no problem for me to handle this asshole, but d-wreck had different plans. i heard him before i saw him. there was a bald eagle screech in the distance, and i could hear skynyrd playing in the air. d-wreck comes barreling out of the crowd and clotheslines af over the ramp railing like the wwe royal rumble. af did a flip and landed straight on his back, knocking the breath out of him. d-wreck, not satisfied with his wrestlemania performance so far, jumps over the railing with a flying knee into af's sternum. if it gives you any insight into the type of guy that d-wreck is, he started barking at af. this scared the fuck outta the rest of his friends, and they got their friend and hightailed it the fuck outta there. d-wreck howled into the night, looked at me, and yelled "thank you! i've been looking to fuck someone up all night!" the best part was that we looked at them on camera, and the dude that i headlocked tried to fight his friends and ended up busting ass in the parking lot, and fucking up his face. they've all been permanently banned from the bar. i guess if you support terrorism, you shouldn't be so much of a pussy. then i went home and railed my beauty queen girlfriend in the name of freedom. because america.i was a few years older then tony growing up. i was also the more adventurous type. at the time of this story i was in 8th grade and he was in 6th. i was having an awfully hard time in my english class (surprise surprise) and i was set to fail for the year if i didn't improve my grades. i however had more important things to do such as chasing this girl i was after. well that monday night tony let out that we had gotten our report cards for the semester. my parents asked how i was doing and tony advised them that i was pretty much guaranteed to flunk my 8th grade year (which i did by the way) cause of english. my father was not happy that i had 1. hidden my report card from him 2. we about to fail english and have to repeat 8th grade he knew my activities i was into sports, hanging out, and finding parties. well my dad confirmed tony reports of my failure and grounded me that tuesday. i found out tony was the one who told them about the report card and i proceeded to dish out the pain to him in the form of a classical sibling beating. i thought i was free and clear as tony took it without saying anything, even apologized for telling our parents about the report cards. well that friday night i had a party and the girl i was chasing at the time was going be there. now of course i was on restriction. however i knew my dad he'd be passed out by 9 pm and my mom would be watching her tv and pass out around 10 pm and not check on me. now before i go further we lived in the country at a time where crime wasn't much of a concern, we never locked our doors or windows. did i mention it was cold as could be as well? this was the winter after all. well i began climbing out the window when my brother tony saw me, he told me i shouldn't do it cause i was on restriction. i said "shut up, and don't tell them or i'll beat you again" he promised he wouldn't say a word to them. off i went, found the party and had an amazing time. even got in an awesome make out session! i also got very drunk, it was an awesome time. it was well after the street lights where turned off. it was bitterly cold but i had such an awesome time i felt immune to the cold. off i went home i went to the very same window i climbed out of...it wouldn't open. what the hell? it was locked! i tried several other windows...all locked. i thought i'd try the door, that was locked as well both of them the back and the front. what the hell! first time in my life all the windows and doors where locked in our house. i even thought of my parents window, which surprise surprise was unlocked. then i thought about it, my old man was sleeping and no way would be my drunken self be able to climb through his window without waking him up and he'd be furious. so i thought i'd wait it out, did i mention it was bitterly cold? not snowing or anything but i was dressed for a party not an out door adventure! i must have waited about an hr before i decided i should just man up and ring the doorbell maybe my brother tony would open the door instead. so i rang the doorbell, and at last! my brother tony was sleeping in the living room. he turned on the light looked at me through the window...and smiled as he turned and walked away. that motherfucker it took several more minutes of my drunken ass ringing the doorbell for my old man to wake up in the middle of the night and find his shivering son at the door, drunk as could be when he was supposed to be on restriction. my old man was pissed and he proceeded for the first time in several years to pull out his belt and whip me. boy did he whip me, and that was just the tip of the iceberg. i was further more restricted and had a terrible next 5 months. the next day i of course i went to find out tony to dish out an even greater ass kicking...when he met me and said "before you throw the first punch just remember what happened to you last time...next time could be worse" i thought for a moment, tony had screwed me over good. he also never told my parents i was out partying. he just locked all the windows and doors in our house. that was creative thinking right there, i decided at that point to call it even. i never fucked with tony again.my uncle always likes to tell this story. hopefully i have the details down well enough from hearing it over the years. about 20 years ago he and my aunt used to live outside of cleveland in a nice little suburb. they had quite a few weird neighbors though. one of them was what i gathered as your typical scumbag stacy. she lived across the street, and was as hot as they came but batshit insane. her scumbag boyfriend lived across the neighborhood, but close enough to be at her house frequently. behind them was walt. i don't know his actual name, but we'll go with walt because that's a good old man name. walt, as they told me, was a very nice man (unless you were black, but that's a different story). he had some health problems--typical old man stuff, a bad back, a failing kidney, uncomfortable stuff. overall, he was a friendly neighbor. once the scumbag boyfriend got settled in his precious relationship, you could hear the sound of his shitty 20-year old chevy rattling down the street from a mile away. it was definitely him. what made it worse is that he often rattled down the street at the wee hours of the night. now walt was an old man who couldn't sleep with his bad back, and my aunt and uncle were busy raising my then-1-year-old cousin. their collective patiences frayed quickly. so, you ask, how do you get revenge on a guy with a loud truck. they didn't. they waited it out, gritted their teeth, and lived their lives. but, you see, scumbags find a way to bring you to the frayed ends of sanity. at 2am, he woke the neighborhood up with a loud bang! you could hear the shitty chevy speeding away down the bumpy cleveland roads. walt woke up and painstakingly rolled out of bed to discover that scumbag drove up to his mailbox, tossed an m80 firecracker inside, and drove away while it made its loud boom inside the metal mailbox. this continued intermittently for a few weeks. aw hell no. one night, my uncle rigged a device to grab it and chuck it back out of the mailbox. he described it as a rat trap with a paper flapper on it. they waited. and waited. scumbag didn't do this every night. he'd separate his attacks far apart enough so that right when you'd forget about him, bang! you'd hear it once again in the loud metal mailbox at 2am. and you'd hear the shitty chevy speed off. some dark tuesday night, walt was still laboring to sleep with his bad back and my uncle and aunt were trying to get in a tiny bit of sleep before my little cousin would rise and shine. by coincidence, my uncle was awake when he heard a shitty chevy pull out from across the street. he heard it slow down and stop real quick, with its shitty diesel engine disrupting the peaceful night. *here comes scumbag, with another m80!* then, a brief silence. then, **thud.** the mailbox contraption flung the m80 back **into the truck**, where scumbag had just enough time to cover his eyes before it went boom in the passenger seat. the shitty chevy rattled down the street once more, this time a bit more urgently. they didn't hear anymore shitty diesel engines at 2am for a long time afterwards.was told this should go here so here it is: i accidently cut this guy off. i waved at him and yelled i was sorry. he followed me, stopped at stop light and threatened to beat me up. tried to get me out of my car. i took pictures of his car, he told me he’d shoot me. so i drove off. i'm a guy who is very afraid of confrontation. i subscribe to a lot of research sites and i reverse looked him up based on his license plate number. i got everything i could. his car had a college license plate and a marine corps sticker. so with his full name, his address, and the school he went to, he was easy to find on facebook. i created a fake facebook account, with pictures of a girl i found on the net. and i friended him. he accepted and started chatting me up a bit. just in messages though. i could see everything about him, saw who is wife was and that he had kids. one day he asked if i’d call him. so i bought one of those cell phones from a grocery store and texted him. told him i couldn’t call, that my boyfriend was the jealous type but i wanted out. our texting went on and on and i eventually started sending him selfie shots of a girl i found. she had a full album and i’d save each image for different days. he started texting me images of his dick, and him jerking off. even a picture of him ejaculating onto one of the pictures i sent. i started sending “thinking of you” cards to his home addressed to him, no return address. he flipped and asked me via text if it was me. he insisted that we meet to talk about it. so i pretended to be my “boyfriend” and told him i was going to blow his fucking brains out. then, i took pictures of everything, the entire exchange, and mailed this entire book to his wife. she ended up leaving and they got a divorce. the idiot never defriended me from facebook. he lost his house, had to pay alimony and child support. he whined about being taken to the cleaners by his “bitch wife”. don’t know what to think about this one. i have this thing where if people really cross me on the road i’ll do background searches on them and then will mess with them. most stuff is i find out someone had a criminal record and i anonymously ask their employer if they know. or i subscribe to barely legal porn mags (gay or straight) and have it mailed to their home or work. but this one i went farther than i ever had. something about the way that guy kept trying to get me out of my car so he could hurt me scared me and made me really angry. but i’m really bothered by the impact this had on his kids. this guy was the last time i did the “search and destroy” thing. i think i may have taken it too far. this is my mom's story. my ocd dad would often argue over stupid petty things that drove my mom crazy. dishes weren't washed to his army specifications, she parked the car wrong in the driveway, you get the picture. she held it in the best she could but finally found a way to get back at him in the most petty but evilly consistent way. he loved raisin bran. it was his pick-me-up bowl of happiness every morning. little by little, the raisins started diminishing in the box. the hell?!?!?! sure enough, each new box of kellogg's raisin bran had only a dozen or less raisin's in each bowl he poured. he bitched, complained and even called up to complain to kellogg's once. some days he'd get lucky as he opened the box. a complete proper bowl of raisins... yet the next day, only a few. he came up with theories that the raisins would only come to the top of the box because of shipping, even bring up this conspiracy at dinner parties and try to get a discussion going. my parents eventually separated when my sister and i were in high school and we lived with our mom. nearly a decade later we are having a massive family christmas gathering and everyone including my dad is present (they were on speaking terms). we are playing this truth or confessions game (family friendly version of truth or dare) and it gets to my mom's turn. confession it is! "*papa, we all know you love your raisin bran.*" massive laughter and cheers as its a well known within the family. "*well remember how they skimped out on the raisins for those 10 or so years? i used the sifter that was out in the garage and sifted whole box every time we got a new one. i only put a half a scoop back in and put the rest on the coffee table for guests*" you could hear a pin drop in that room as my dad just shook his head (he took his cereal seriously). he just chuckled a laugh and the room burst out laughing. 12 years of doing this to him. (an old story of mine) i used to go to a public high school where the majority of students were low to middle class italian origin kids of immigrants (90% +). tough going to say the least. when i was in high school i used to get bullied by a guy called renaldo. we had a few scraps, either verbally or fisticuffs over the years. i was always the type of guy who wouldn’t take other people’s shit and while others balked at giving me a hard time particularly when i went through puberty and became one of the tallest, largest guys in school he somehow always managed to give me a hard time. it was a tough time but in a way, i paid my dues early and learnt from a stern father that if people punched you, you punch back and you punch harder and you'll know if they are men or not. as luck would have me, renaldo ended up in the same college i went to and he always managed to somehow, someway be a little shit to me. what made things worse is that we fell for the same girl, andrea who eventually became my girlfriend of over 4 years. everyone knew he had feelings for her and that it killed him she was with me and not him. he always tried to “seduce” her with random calls and emails, being the son of a wealthy father who owned his own construction company, that he had nice cars, lots of money, a bunch of shit that i didn’t have and over the years worked hard to earn coming from a low income family that was having problems making ends meet. he was a constant issue the first year of my relationship and we had several conflicts, years later, after college and shortly after i broke up with andrea, i received an e-mail from him out of the blue. i never corresponded with him (facebook didn’t exist back then) and he went out and told me in an epic letter which went far too long, swore at me in excess and used terrible english (no wonder he never finished college and dropped out to work with daddy). basically it was a "no one liked me in college and to f off". i haven’t seen him in well over 2 years, nor did we have any real friends in common. as a way of keeping my cool, nor did i want him to have the satisfaction to get me mad, i never responded to his emails (he sent several). however, i couldn't let his taunting go without consequences. so i went online and googled his name. after searching around a bit i easily found a complete profile of him regarding his career, where he worked and what type of work it was. his father passed away recently and he now owned his father's business and had a team of employees working for him. i spied a bit more and hung onto the address of his place of employment for several weeks while i plotted. one day, i proceeded to go into a local sex shop and i purchased the largest, fattest, floppiest black dildo that i could find along with some ky and i went home, wrote a special note for him and put it along with the big fat black dildo and ky and boxed it in a standard box that couldn’t be traced back to me and sent it priority mail that required for him specifically to sign. the note read, "since you have so much time to search out people that never gave a shit about you to begin with, i figured you'd have enough time to go fuck yourself with this!" one of our mutual acquaintances dropped me an email a few days later. this acquaintance worked for renaldo during his "internship" and apparently the package arrived while they were preparing to head out for a team lunch on a friday and he was very excited to get the box opened since renaldo thought it was something he ordered online that he was expecting and would "make it a good weekend" and he opened it in front of a number of co-workers and instead of whatever he ordered he pulls out....a giant black floppy dildo. priceless…possible nsfw living with a guy from the age of 19, i was besotted. he was a little older than me, and a drummer. as a teenager i was bowled over and besotted, and it was only a couple of months after we met that i moved in with him. we'll call him pbb for ponytailed brummy bastard. i really, really loved him. even when he told me he was still in love with his ex (who had cheated on him) and would insist i should do the housework and shopping and cooking even though we both worked full time, because it was his house, he earned more than me, and i didn't pay any rent (all of my wages went into his bank account in his name). in case you missed it, i loved him, i really did, even when he'd started to go out and *gasp* happen to iron his own shirt. wearing aftershave. even when he went out "for a couple with the lads" then stumble in the bedroom at 3am, hardly able to stand ... his excuse? "someone had spiked his drink". i even still loved him when he came in at 3am, with his ironed shirt all creased, aftershave on, and with a shag tag glowing from his neck ... his excuse? "my mate steve did it to me for a laugh". i moved into the spare room in protest, surely he would come in, apologise, change his ways, promise not to go out as often, not come back as drunk? nope. this stalemate went on for 2 months, i still loved him, but moved out to my parent's house at the age of 25. i just moved a few things out with me, just my cassette stereo (lol, a couple of decades old this story) and my clothes. i even left my beloved cat behind, on the agreement when i get my own place i can come back and reclaim him. for some reason he let me keep a key. i realised only a couple of days later i had forgotten the lead for my boom box. i knew he was going to be out with the lads at the time i was driving back from work, so deliberately timed it when he wasn't at home. pre mobile phones, i'm not having the pain of speaking to him, too much, i love him. in and out, job done. i walk in, something is wrong. the house is clean. not clean, but **clean**. wait, what's this on the mantlepiece? a generic love card, no occasion but you know the kind a la roger the rabbit "how much do i love you? let me count the ways!" inside was neat flowery writing "dear pbb, i love you so much, from &lt;insert cheating witch's name, cb&gt;. slowly, i see the cassette answerphone machine is flashing with a message. my curiosity turbo charges me over there, o little red flashing light, what can you tell me? the female voice purrs "oh, pbb, i had such a luuuurvely night last night, i can't wait to do it again soon!" looking around the room, two wine glasses. by this time my head is like a volcano. i run upstairs to the room and there's a fucking wedding ring next to his side of the bed! wtf!! i am shuddering, crying, drive back to my parent's house in bits. i walk in the door, sobbing so hard and loud my mum asked if i had been abused .. i couldn't talk for the snot bubbles of anguish. why doesn't he love me? we talk, and i want revenge, but more than petty. i plot. i plan. i think of sewing prawns into the hems of his curtains. too much hassle. cutting his clothes up? not my style. i am too subtle for that. i want long-range passive revenge. dad got a van. we went the next day (saturday) with the cat basket. everything that i had bought and left behind i was going to take. only things that were mine. that was the only rule. side note: pbb used to half-work every saturday at a music store in town, talking drums and shit. he was screwing the owner's sister. i recognised her voice and name from the love card. so, i took the washing machine i had bought 3 months earlier - did i mention he was a drummer - i replaced it with a washboard and thimbles he used for percussion. i took the tin of christmas ham that was out of date in the cupboard. i took the cutlery as it was eternal beau and i bought it from argos. i took the teabags, as i had bought the last lot. i took the double bed and mattress, and i took my cat. just before we left, i told dad to sit in the van, i had my own special goodbye to say. the previous night i had found every single printed photo of his face. this took an hour, before camera phones etc, i cut them all up and ripped them into quarters. i hid handfuls under carpets, inside vases with dried flowers, behind picture frames, under ornaments, back of cupboards, inside the freezer ice cube tray and behind the bath panel. nothing obvious to the eye. whilst i was in the bathroom, i opened the cabinet and saw his precious joop aftershave. i crouched over the toilet, pissed in it and put the top back on. finally, i took the cassette recording from the answer machine, stopped off on the way home at a phone box, rang the music store where he always hung out on a saturday, asked to speak to him and said in a calm, controlled voice: **"you have one week to tell her husband. or i do"** and hung up. i sold the bed the same day to a bloke down the pub, sold the washing machine cut price to an elderly neighbour, and resettled my cat into my parent's home (he loved it there). i had a phone call at 3am when he got home to see he had no bed or washing machine and spat down the phone that i was an "evil vitreous bitch". when i got up in the morning i had to get the dictionary out as it was pre google and i had no idea what vitreous meant. 3 months later part 2 came into play. i started to call his friends, pretend i was drunk, giggle and confess i had pissed in his aftershave, so eventually word got out what i had done, but it was too late by then. tl;dr cheating ex-boyfriend gets my piss kissed off his neck for months by cheating witch edit: clarificationearly winter 2013, dallas texas, 9:30am my senior year of high school i had a free period in the morning, allowing me to arrive at school a full class period later than everyone else. this particular day it was pouring rain, the streets were backed up, and i was running late. i got to school around the time i needed to be in attendance at my first class. being late i knew that most of the choice parking spots would be occupied and i would have to walk a little way further than usual. this wouldn't normally be a problem, my teacher was cool and didn't mind if people showed up a few minutes late, except that it was pouring rain and i had important paper assignments to carry inside. i pull into the lot and there it was: the holy grail. there is an open spot right up against the school. i could park there and run under the lip of the roof and get to the front door with nothing wet but my shoes. as i neared the parking space i saw the car. a late model audi(the lowest echelon of german auto making) occupying not one, but two parking spaces. this was no accident. he was not parked a few inches over the line, he was parked directly on top of it. normally i would deal with this in a sensible, passive-aggressive manner by squeezing myself into the space to the left of him leaving only inches between my car and his driver-side door, but the school parking spaces were narrow, and i drove a large american sedan. instead i was forced to circle the lot until i found the *only* unoccupied space, a good 200 yards from the building. i tucked my papers under my shirt but the downpour was too intense and they were soaked, along with my clothes, hair, shoes, socks, and pride. as i passed the douchemobile on my way towards the building i was overcome with rage. his windshield wipers were of the variety that slide easily on and off the hinges, so i pulled them off and dropped them down a nearby storm drain. if i had to walk to class in the rain, he would have to drive home blinded by it.background: this was a snobby high class apartment community in the southern california orange curtain filled with residents and managers who think every problem is balanced by money and anyone else (contractor, service employee, or other) was below them and expendable. as the security contractor we were expendable, and they made it clear because we were hired to replace the previous contractor that we found out were set up to fail by the same managers that hired us. we weren't hired to provide security so much as for the company to have someone to blame as their liability shield if something went wrong. the conflict: among the many residents thinking that their high rent entitled them to the right to complain about anything they wanted was one that we will refer to as 4323. he would call in and complain at any hour he wanted, most commonly 15+/- minutes from 10 pm when the pools closed to complain about people in the pool or to tell us how to do our job (the pools close at 10 pm and most of the time he called before that just to say we needed to close them). he would complain we weren't doing out job, didn't do out job, he couldn't sleep because a neighbor was screwing too loudly, all sorts of ridiculous things. he also left his window open which was probably why he supposedly could hear everything and later became his achilles heel. the property managers offered to move him to a different apartment but he refused because of his view of the pools on the top floor and the managers would always settle because he paid a really high rent anyways. after over a year of this we retaliated. conflict resolution/revenge: the previous month 4323 had called in 3 times a day every day so i told the other security guards to pee in a bucket or contribute something virile and liquefied to the "gag bag" every time he called and it would be put to good use after 3 days we had enough. i was still in college as an engineering major at the time and after enough fluid mechanics and hydraulic lab work, i had designed a prototype revenge machine: basically a giant super-soaker with a .5" nozzle powered by compressed gas (i used a propane tank because it was convenient). as security guards we had access to the roof and i already had a vantage point in mind for. i had a previously calculated set of tables to make the perfect shot, a little bit of trigonometry and a partner to help set up the shot and with the pull of the trigger we sent over a gallon of piss, fish guts, yellow dye, and left over indian food through the window and onto their rug without even grazing the window edges all while under the cover of night. 4323 apparently didn't have any idea what had happened the following morning, complaining got them nowhere but they got pegged with the cleaning fine because 4323 couldn't prove they didn't make the mess themselves and they were at home at the time (which was even more surprising they did not hear a splash after all the noise complaints they made that year). tl;dr: -guy #4323 complains too much too long to security guard -security guard uses 'engineering': makes giant putrid filled super-soaker -guy #4323 gets fined for cleaning mysterious stinky yellowish stain on rug edit 11/25/13: for those asking more about the "bad baby" super soaker device: -the closest existing commercially available water gun i can think of to what i used would be the "stream machine" if you can imagine a preassurized gas chamber behind the plunger ( it also had a main spring in the gas chamber connected to the media divider behind the fluid reservoir but it didn't actually contribute force but assisted the assemble of the device. -this actually wasn't the first time i fired this contraption before, just the first time i used the equipment off campus off record and using a fluid that wasn't entirely water. the first time i tried it on a grass lawn on campus i didn't take into account the recoil (impulse momentum principle: sum of forces = pqv) and the "bad baby" ended up recoiling backwards and shot some of us in the back of the knee with the stream of water. this problem was solved by standing on the mounting plate. also this contraption was originally part of a lab experiment and occasionally used to encourage prospective students to enroll in engineering. -thankfully the jet nozzle at the end of the tube was enough to keep the flow laminar but there was a system of about 40 parallel straws each 2" long at the end of the chamber just before the shut off valve before the nozzle similar but not the same as a fireman's hose. these straws also had the double feature of stopping the plunger before it hit the end of the chamber like a shock absorber if the shut off valve was left on before the chamber emptied. it also means that there was about 1/4 liter of fluid left in the straw and nozzle. for those asking why we felt #4323 deserved the wrath of the bad baby: -it wasn't just his calling in and complaining, he was telling us how to do our job and how to solve problems before they were even a problem on a neurotic scale. he often did make phony calls to us about a trespasser in the pool area while we were already watching it, this is one of the most selfish things you can do to call security attention to a knowingly false problem and forcing us to leave other areas vulnerable. if we were law enforcement he would've been cited for harassment or false reporting. and we weren't the only people troubled by 4323, the management and other residents had growing problems as well. management would not act because of money, and his making enemies made it harder for him to think of a suspect. he also had a bad habit of smoking off the balcony and raining ashes onto the cabana area below, which we witnesses and did eventually cause comparable level of property damage, but 4323 money meant more to the management. also last i checked, 2 years after this incident and he was still making the same bs calls and complaints and still refused to move to another apartment, clearly bitching was his hobby. -and for the people asking about the distance we used a 3-4-5 triangle to measure the 30' shot. (30' hypotenus) -props for the literal revenge machine!tldr: ex roommate posts craigslist ad for a prostitute with my number and it soon backfires. my roommate (we’ll call him sleazebag) was engaged to his girlfriend of 3 months. since we shared a room whenever we wanted private time we had to make sure the other wasn’t going to be around. it was all fine for the first few months but then it got excessive. they would text me once a day around 3pm usually when i would finish my last class asking if i could give them “alone time.” for a few hours. for a while i dealt with it and would go to the gym for a while. one day he asked if he could have the room for about 30 minutes, which i replied “fine but i do have to study for an exam and need my stuff at some point today.” well an hour goes by and i decide that it’s been enough time so i go into my room. they both yell that they had just started. i grabbed my books that were near the door and left. that night i get a hate filled text about how “i am the worse roommate ever” and how i was “ruining their relationship.” i just ignored the text and came back to the room when i was done studying. he then started doing petty things such as trashing my plastic and foam plates and bowls, putting his trash on my table/bed, drawing penis’ on my work. well one day i was in my room on my laptop and i hear the two start cracking up. sleazebag goes “hey take a look at this.” he shows me an ad of craigslist with my phone number posted as a male gay prostitute. i tell him to remove the ad and that it wasn’t funny, which he insisted was just a prank and that no one would call. soon i get a text from some random number. so at that point i decide to get some revenge. well they had a particular schedule, sex every afternoon at 3pm. i had remembered there was a way to have two numbers to call each other. the number of the rando still in my phone because i never delete texts, and i decided to have the two call each other. well my roommate answered and tried to find out how this guy got his number. apparently the man was lonely and had called and texted him multiple times a day usually around 3pm every day. well fast forward a year and i run into sleazebag on the bus and he told me how he got a house with his fiancé. seeing me reminded him of the ad which i had to report to get it deleted and he sent me a picture of the ad he had reposted. this time though we didn’t share a room so i made an identical ad placed his address and the two numbers that called me i had call him, and referred them to the new ad. let just say he didn’t find it funny anymore and deleted his ad. this happened about 10 years ago when i was still in high school. i used to work at a restaurant as a bus boy. one particular night, a man came in by himself and ordered a pizza, and appetizer, and a few beers. nothing weird about him, but it was a slow night, and i distinctly remember him because i'm fairly certain he had come in to dine before. he ate his food and left. i cleaned the table after he left, and as soon as i was finished, the waitress who had his table asked me if i accidentally threw his bill and money away. now at this point i had been working at the restaurant for 2 years, and i always check to make sure there isn't any money or credit card receipt on the table before i throw anything away. well the guy had left without paying. yeah it sucks, and yes the waitress got stiffed on a mediocre tip, but it sucks knowing that we probably would never catch the guy because who is dumb enough to come back to a restaurant in which you previously dined and dashed? well fast forward 3 weeks. it's another slow night, and i notice a familiar face walk in the door. he's by himself, and one of the waitresses sits him at a booth. now i know for sure that this is the same guy that was in the restaurant 3 weeks prior that left without paying. i asked the waitress what he ordered, and it was an appetizer and a pizza. i told the owner that this guy was the same guy that stiffed the restaurant 3 weeks ago. the owner pulled up that old receipt and it was identical to what the guy had just ordered. one of the pizza cooks was pretty ghetto looking. he had lots of tattoos up and down his arms, and had a general mean look on his face most of the time (he was actually a very nice guy). so the owner told him to go stand by the door in case the guy tried to leave without paying. the pizza cook also made a point to not break eye contact with the customer. at this point, everyone working knew what was going on, so occasionally other employees would come to the dining room floor and take a peek at the guy. the guy started noticing that the employees were looking at him, and he became obviously uncomfortable. the manager went to his table and explained that his food was ready, but he would have to pay his bill before he received his food (she didn't mention his other unpaid bill yet). he then requested that his order be "to go." the manager went back and packed up his food. meanwhile, the guy got up to use the bathroom. once he walked toward the bathroom, the pizza cook watching the door left his post to go talk to the manager about what was going on. the guy saw his opportunity and booked it out of the restaurant. the manager and i both saw him leave, so she ran out after the guy. she caught up to him pretty quick and asked why he left and that he didn't pay his bill. he tried to play dumb and said "really? i thought i left money at the table." the manager told him "no, you didn't pay, and you also didn't pay for your meal last time you were here." he then said "well i only live a few blocks away, i was just running home to go get money to pay for my food." the manager brought the guy back in and sat him down at the bar then proceeded to call the police. the cops showed up a few minutes later and asked the guy why he didn't pay this time or last time. the guy exercised his right to remain silent and was put in hand cuffs and walked out of the restaurant into the back seat of the police car all while the employees and the few customers that were present were all clapping loudly. the guy never came back after that. tl;dr: guy leaves restaurant without paying, comes back 3 weeks later and tries to do the same thing. gets caught and arrested.at an old apartment complex i used to live in, i was in a unit on the top floor. the walls are rather soundproof, but the ceilings and floors dampened most sound, unless you accidentally drop something really listen. honestly, if you really strain, you could hear the television show the people downstairs were watching, but floors/ceilings were never as soundproof as walls in this complex. most downstairs neighbors i had in the 5 years i lived there never complained.... until i had one that did. first complaint i had was in the form of a letter from my front office, claiming 'loud video game noises' and that i had a dog(i had neither a console or a dog at this time), and that i had to remove the dog and stop playing the console or be evicted, and this was my first of two warnings or strikes on my lease. i walked right over to the office. pointed out, since the notice was inside my unit, if they saw a console or evidence of a dog. woman at the front office conceded i was right, and removed the warning from my file. a week later, i had a note on my door from downstairs complaining about noise. i went down and knocked on the door. neighbor didnt' bother to answer. later on that same week, as i was in bed, reading, no radio or television on, i had a cop knocking on my door for a noise complaint. i invited the officer in. he looked around, agreed with me that there was no way any noise was coming from my unit. same cop came back twice. his last visit, he said that he was fed up. he agreed that i was doing nothing wrong, and that the police will no longer be entertaining any noise complaint reports from my downstairs neighbor. he also said the complex told him the same thing. next day, i found my shoes suddenly felt very very heavy. get home, gotta make sure there's no dirt... stomp stomp stomp. cooking? need to mince garlic? why mince? let's pulverize with a hammer. wham wham wham! hmm, ya know, this television show could use more bass. i heard beating on my floor. screaming, shouting. police never came, office never bothered me about it. i just discovered this sub-reddit today and am thoroughly enjoying reading all the pro-revenge story's and thought id share mine. anyway getting on with my story this all happened the summer of my sophomore year of high school and the end of my junior year. so im walking with my girlfriend at the time and a few of our friends back to my house from our local park in the middle of summer vacation. the neighborhood the park is in doesn't have sidewalks so were walking in the street casually moving out the way as cars need to get past until this k5 blazer (in-case your unfamiliar with them k5 blazers are basically suvs where u can take the top off and be left with what i consider a pick up truck with seats in the bed) with this obnoxious custom paint job is behind us we move to the side thinking nothing of it until they slowly pull up besides us and 4 guys with squirt guns spray us with god knows what.....me and friends decided we would be better of just not pondering that,they then speed off while some of my friends throw rocks and yell and i try to calm down my now crying girlfriend. fast forward a couple months after school has started again,i realize the d-bags that sprayed us goes to the same school as us after see the obnoxious blazer in the student parking lot and decide to start to hatch a plan for revenge. i wait out the rest of the school year till 2 weeks before our last day of school and its now sufficiently warm for my plan,i go to the grocery store buy 2 dozen eggs and 2 gallons of milk and let them sit outside and ferment in the heat so everything was nice and rancid and disgusting perfect to use for revenge for what they had done last year. last day of school i skipped my 1st class of the day and what i had thought would be the hardest part of this was actually fairly simple because the d-bags left there window down allowing for easy access to the blazer so i artfully plaster the insides of the truck with the rotten eggs and then poured the milk all over the seats and floor making sure to get some on the steering wheel walked down the street to ditch the evidence at a nearby convenience store trashcan and went to my 2nd class to let my revenge ferment some more till the end of the day when i gathered all of friends so we can see there reactions and they were indeed priceless well worth waiting the entire school year to act on my plan. the owner of the truck opened the door stared inside and then flipped out while everyone coming out of the school stared and the owners friends trying to help scoop out the chunks of milk and egg in disgust so satisfying. morel of the story revenge is best served after fermenting in the sun for 2 weeks. also sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes its like 4 am and i have not slept yet.i was not especially mean when i was younger but, when called upon to chime in, i could be a little bitch. i went to highschool in a small town in the midwest and my sophmore history teacher, mrs. smythe, had a son who was a senior and stood behind me in choir. i'm incredibly ashamed to admit what i said about her because this woman was one of the kindest, most intelligent, and supportive teachers i ever had and she was close to 350lbs on a very petite frame. this lady had to use a scooter and elevators meant for injured students to traverse the campus just to give you an idea of how the weight impacted her life. so, i was just bitch-assing with some friends in the cafeteria and they started in on just how incredibly fat mrs. smythe was and many, many sophomoric comments were thrown about. i wasn't really engaged in what they were saying for the first part but then someone said something about how many people could be fed if she were cut up for meat on a deserted island. i made some pithy remark about how one of her thighs was the perfect shape and weight of thanksgiving turkey which, for some dumb reason, broke everyone up and my comment was passed along to mrs. smythe's son sometime in the following week. i heard smythe jr was, justifiably, pissed about what i had said but he didn't really do anything other than give me the stink eye from time to time so i thought that's all there was to it. i don't know what it was that made him choose this particular day to play arson but i think he was probably stewing over it for a while and finally decided to take revenge. i was standing in front of him in choir and i kept feeling some weird woosh on the back of my neck, like someone was blowing on it. i was wearing an old black nike track jacket with white piping that was popular c 2002 - it was probably 70% polyester and 30% rayon or some shit - but flammable and meltable. smythe jr was using a cigarette lighter to slowly melt the back of my jacket because the material didn't catch fire for very long like fabric but melted like plastic... i began to smell a very odd burning scent and turned around to see little smythe casually toss a lighter down through the risers we were on into the abandoned orchestra pit below. unrecoverable. the entire back of my jacket had burned up to my shoulder blades and was merged with my shirt underneath. when everyone realized what was happening they were all hysterical with laughter cause if i wanted to have a clothed upper body for the rest of the day i was going to have to walk around looking like a train crash survivor :/ - moral: don't talk shit cause it will always come back around to give you light chemical burns. *spelling edits*tl:dr: bully hits me from 3rd-to 6th grade. i start my long-term revenge in 5th grade culminating in a short fight and a bloody nose. some backstory: i was born in korea, moved to the southern us until the beginning of 3rd grade, and moved to the northeast for 3rd grade onwards. the school i attended in the south was a more or less a sanctuary. educators loved their children, and confrontation rarely occurred between kids. so when i learned i would move to a different place, it was extremely hard for me to handle. assimilating myself into the new school in the north wasn't easy, primarily because none of my classmates wanted to spend time with me or associate with me. this is how i spent most of my elementary to middle school years. (the schools in my area were all elementary + middle schools put together) however, there was one chinese boy who showed interest in me, and we started a tentative relationship. unfortunately, this child was kind of an angry child and, having no one else to take out his anger on, often acted physically violent towards me. it started off as simple pushing, shoving and taking balls away at recess. it progressed through tripping, into holding me down, and then into kicking me in the legs and punching my stomach. of course, i told many teachers and other staff members about what was happening. unfortunately, nothing got fixed, because there's only so much teachers can do, when an angry chinese lady is screaming about how her son is sensitive and that **i** was the problem child (i had to sit through that meeting. i actually so uncomfortable that i asked my principal if i could be excused to go home). by 5th grade, this bullying had peaked at one moment where we were in art class, finishing up our pottery that we had been working on. we had just finished glazing them and were getting ready to paint. he comes to sit with me to paint, and before i can get a brush in my hand, he picks up my jar (about fist-sized) and proceeds to swing it and connect with my jaw. he then opens the window and throws it outside (unbroken, but chipped). our art teacher was an african-american man (in his late 40s at that time) and he wasn't having any of it. he yelled at the chinese boy, sent him to the principal's office, and sat down with me in the corner of the room. i don't recall crying, but i'm sure i was. and i'll never forget what he said. in his soft voice, he told me that he'd been seeing this happen to me and none of the other kids intervene. he told me that i would "have to take [my] stand, and make sure that kid never even comes close to thinking about coming after me again." i understood this wasn't something to tell other teachers about or my parents. my revenge started off quietly. his missing paintings were found in the art sink (a complete goopy mess), his recorder (bought with parent money) used in music time was filled with glue, his homework would end up missing (he got zeros for the assignment... oops), his backpack once ended up turtled filled with pinecones and wet leaves, while his books and pencils ended up half-buried in dirt. i noticed that he progressively got more frustrated with what was happening that he started to redirect his anger towards me. so. the beginning of the school year in 6th grade, he came over during recess to push me over, step on me, etc. he never got a chance to. the second he came over. i threw a ball at point blank range at his face. it connected and threw him off his balance. regaining his balance, he tried to retaliate by kicking. his foot connects with my shin, while my tiny fist connects with his nose. i had never seen so much blood come out of one orifice of the human body. to this day, i haven't seen that much blood in one place since the great blood exodus from the chinese boy's nose. he starts crying, teachers whisk us to the principal's office (conveniently located next to the nurse's office). i tell our principal that he got what he deserved, because i "put all the 'hurt' he gave me since 3rd grade into one big punch." i was sent home, but not suspended. parents not angry, but worried about me and what would come of it. chinese mother calls my parents to make me apologize. my dad takes the receiver out of my mom's hand and hangs up on her. i went back to school the next day. but the chinese boy didn't. when he finally did return after a few days, he still had a swollen nose. he didn't talk to me or interact with me for the rest of our middle-school time together, and he moved on to a different high school. so when i was younger and living at home, my parents got me to do chores which was no big deal, except i really hated mowing the grass because i essentially felt like crap for the next 48 hours. this is despite my doctor warning my parents of my allergies and urging them to not to let me do it, or let me be outside while its being mowed. but my parents still make me do it and i have to grit my teeth and sneeze my way around the yard. one day, my parents leave to go for a walk with my sister. i'm kinda ticked because i would much rather be going for a walk than to sneeze my brains out mowing grass. so as i finish up mowing the yard just as they come back with ice cream in hand! none for me apparently... they now are going to go to the mall and do some shopping and offer for me to come along. i ask if they would wait for me to have a shower and possibly stop for ice cream so i could have some too. nope, they can't wait for me to have a shower and they wouldn't stop for ice cream anyways... so they leave me behind again. i pull out the fertilizer spreader and large bag of fertilizer. i know approximately 1/8th of a bag is the usual amount i am told to use for our size of yard, so i load the rest of the bag (about 3/4 of it) into the spreader and proceed to spread fertilize in the yard. i then found the "round up" plant killer and loaded that up in our sprayer. this is the stuff that we used to kill grass around the shed and around the deck to stop the grass from growing. i sprayed an even light coat through the middle of the yard. guess who didn't have to mow the grass for the rest of the year? our grass was like straw for the rest of the summer, and even the next year it grew back very thin. **tl;dr** i was allergic to grass, parents made me mow the yard even though doctors said i was too allergic. one day my parents take my sister to get ice cream and go to the mall without me so i get revenge by over fertilizing and spraying plant (grass) killer through the yard. **edit:** fixed derpy grammar/spelling **added note:** i was 12 or 13 when i did this. i know very well how immature i was at that age. thanks for letting me know.this i can attribute to a coworker when he quit several years ago at my old job. he was, for the most part, a malingering, useless kid not worthy of any job that wasn't menial. he eventually quit in search of better employment and that's when it happened. he had been there for 2 years without promotion and decided it was time. the owner and his wife were crotchety old fucks who treated many of the staff like shit, personal servants to do their bidding at their small mechanical company. when, let's call him rick, quit they decided to ride his ass because that was their mo. treat you like shit normally. quit? make sure you know you're a piece of shit. they laid into rick ever chance they got. being the company gopher he was all over the place doing different tasks and could often be unsupervised for lengths of time. they should have known better and either paid him out or had him do supervised work for his last 2 weeks. we had a problem on a hot summer friday around 10am. the sewers in the main building were backing up. the main drain in the shop wasn't draining and neither were the toilets or the sinks. everyone was annoyed. one of the guys in the tool shop came over to the main building to complain that the same thing was going on there too. main drains, toilets, etc. all backing up. shit was actually backing up onto the floors. they call a plumber to come out and bring a vac truck too. after a few hours of work they get us up and running again. next week the same damn thing happens again. shit backing up everywhere. call the plumber again. they roll out to get us going again. different crew this time. the guy tells us we have a bigger problem with the sewage lines and need to call the city. we get a crew from the city the next day. they come out with snakes and cameras. the problem is bigger than they figured. major blockage. gonna need to dig up the lines and do some major work. two days later, a twelve man crew including a fucking backhoe and they start digging. they dig through asphalt to get town to the lines. the big boss is out there acting like he's awesome and inspecting all the work as they go. the foreman informs the boss that there is a piece of plastic stuck in the pipes but that's only at the head of the blockage. **what it was trapping in place was reams and reams of paper towel, shit and other sewage. i mean more paper towel that is in stock at costco is stuck in there.** the boss losses his mind. "it's the fucking staff!" what happened: rick had enough. he would disappear and for 90 min each day he was flushing roll after roll of paper towel down the drain. he'd been at if for months. **edit: tl;dr- disgruntled employee flushes untold amounts of paper towel down the drain leading to a sewer blockage followed by shit flooding and eventual sewage line excavation (costing thousands, probably 10-15 thousand) of work to the city all bc the boss treated him like a piece of shit for a couple years.**about 10 years ago i was working a summer job as a lifeguard at a beach a few hours from my home town. i moved out of the awful employee housing when i got lucky and found a little house, 1 bedroom 1.5 bathroom with a loft for the low low cost of $600/month. now to keep the costs down, after the first month i rented some space to a three other lifeguards, a college age bulgarian girl who was super nice and a great roommate, and a set of 19 year old twins from ohio or something who were two of the worst people i have ever met. the loft is by far the largest room in the house, literally covering the entire footprint of the building so i take that as my bedroom, the bulgarian gets the other bedroom and the twins get the couches in the living room. they did your run of the mill roommate bs, paying rent late, stealing food, leaving food out until our kitchen was overrun with cockroaches. i also have reason to believe that they staged a break in and stole laptops and cameras from the bulgarian and i, but this goes far beyond that, they were really shitty people. i routinely found myself preventing them from doing what could only be called date rape, or just plain rape. they would brag about getting girls drunk, fucking them then stealing money/phones/whatever out of the girls purses, real scumbag stuff there was a lifeguard party at another house and one of the twins got caught in a back room with his hand up a passed out girl's skirt and would have gotten beat down for it if he hadn't ran out the back door. the other twin decided to fight one of my friends in my front yard. i stepped in to break up the fight and was pushing my friend in to my car when the twin saw an opportunity to punch me in the back of my head when i wasn't looking. i really regret driving my friend home instead of beating this kid down for the sucker punch but i honestly think he did more damage to his own knuckles than to me. so i'm stuck with these two for the summer and that sucks balls, but i'm making the best of it. specifically i'm charging the twins $300 each a month for rent for the two living room couches and the bulgarian pays me $400 for a private room. the twins cover rent, the bulgarian covers electric and the leftovers go in my pocket. the only downside is that i have to play landlord to all three. before you judge me realize that they were still getting a pretty good deal living with me, this house is two blocks from the ocean and on average rooms are going for $450-650; also i was the only one with my name on the lease so i was assuming any liability. anyway, the summer drags on, all my friends go back to school and at this point it's a few random stragglers, the twins, and myself working the beach in the post-season. there is a small community college just down the road from the beach, so at the end of the season there is an influx of freshman girls out on the beach tanning. the twins egos are at an all time high after getting heaps of phone numbers from naive children and they decide they want to throw a party. being the only one over 21, they ask me to get a keg. i agree but under the condition that they pay for the keg, deposit and tap. the night of the party comes and they are keen to tap the keg but i convince them to hold off until all the girls they invited start showing up. it turned out pretty much exactly as i expected, not one person showed up. not even free beer could get people to hang out with these kids. we clear out the fridge and put the keg in it so it will be cold "tomorrow night when people come over". i wake up the next morning for my day off and the twins head off to work. halfway through my morning routine i start thinking about all the bullshit these kids have pulled over the course of the summer and i come up with a plan. i call up my supervisor at the lifeguard agency, we talk for while and agree that they don't have any real need for me until next summer. i walk across the street to my landlords house and tell him that i'll be leaving a week early and ask him if he could come inspect the house for my security deposit before i leave. my landlord shows up just as i finish packing all my stuff into my car, he checks out the house and gives me my deposit back in cash. i tell him the twins are staying and that any future rent or damage will be their responsibility, he's a pretty laid back guy so he agrees. he's about to leave when i say "hey man, can you help me out with something". i tell him about the twin's failed party and suggest that a keg of beer is far more than they know what to do with. he has a good laugh and the two of us unload the keg from the fridge and load it into my trunk. there were a couple cases of beer as well, i give those to my landlord for his help. i'm just about to leave for good when i notice an opportunity for a cherry on top. there is one lone coronita (one of those miniature coronas they put in margaritas) sitting unopened on the counter. i take it and carefully put it in the empty fridge, right where the keg used to be, can't leave the twins completely empty handed. i lock my old house for the last time, give my key to the landlord and start calling my friends in my home town to tell them that we are having a kegger. two hours into my ride home i get a call from one of the twins. he went through all five stages of grief during our short conversation. denial: "you didn't take the keg did you?" anger: "you stole our keg motherfucker, i'll kick your ass!" bargaining: "bring back our keg or i'll call the cops (good luck dickhead, the deposit is in my name)". depression: "we are having girls over tonight, how will we be able to fuck them without alcohol", and finally acceptance: "fuck you, keep it!" a few hours later i'm drinking to victory with my home town friends. tl;dr: lived with a couple of scumbags for the summer, got free beer.  my dad was a great guy. pretty laid back but sharp-witted with professional-level ball-buster skills. he took everything in stride until you crossed him. this is a tale about one of the poor souls who did. my dad lived across the street from a guy who worked in the same mill as dad so he would give dad a ride to and from work and come over when there was nothing else going on just to hang out. drank dad's beer, ate dad's snacks, what have you. anyway, dad quite loudly questioned a company policy that disregarded a state holiday and they canned him. dad was annoyed but figured that's how things work sometimes and took the unemployment comp happily. he went and informed the guy that he wouldn't need a ride that afternoon because he had been sacked. the guy made a weird face and said that was fine. dad made a mental note of the weird look and went home to start his "vacation". anyway, dad had been outside playing with my nephew when the guy got home. dad gave him a friendly wave. it was not returned. in fact, the guy didn't even look in his direction. dad figured maybe something else had happened at work that day that was distracting and blew it off as nothing. but the next day he didn't wave again. just locked his car up and hurried into his house like he wasn't even there. so the day after that, dad called to him and was once again ignored. dad was starting to get pretty miffed at this point. why was this guy being such a dick now? because they didn't work at the same place anymore? that's dumb as hell! after a few days of this, dad actually went up to his car and tried to talk to him but alas, he was still ignoring him. with the numerous blowoffs wearing on his mind, dad came up with his revenge. you see, dad was a drinker. not a violent, mean drinker but a daily beer-drinking guy. and so was the guy across the street. so much so that he always had a few beers on the way to work. at seven in the morning while driving. dad never said anything because he grew up during a time when you could drink a bottle of whiskey while driving and the only thing someone would say to you was to not throw it out the window. but he was definitely going to say something now. about an hour before the guy left for work, dad called the non-emergency police line. he told them that there would be someone leaving their house at five of seven not only with a buzz on but with a beer in their lap while driving. he told them where he was leaving from and what direction he was going in. the dispatcher asked him if he was serious and dad said (and i quote) "like fucking cancer." at ten to seven, dad sat at the kitchen table and waited to see if anything would come of his little tip. he saw the guy come out of his house with a few beers, right on time. he heard the car start up, saw him pull out of his parking space...and then heard a siren whoop twice. dad smiled and went out on the front stoop to watch the show. and it was a pretty good one, too. apparently, the guy had been busted for dui a few times so he was instantly arrested, the car was impounded and he never saw the guy again. one time, when he was recounting the story to my sister's friend, i laughed and said "dad, you're a snitch!" he looked over at me, shrugged and said "he should have just said 'hi'."note: this story was set in a time when employment laws in my area were ridiculously lax ... so new zealand in the 1990s. my family comes from a small town, the sort where people parking in the middle of the street to have a conversation with you is so natural an occurrence that the locals just drive around the parked car. out-of-towners, bless them, think the hold up is only going to be a second or so. they could not be more mistaken. so laid back, but not clinically dead. things do move, but at a slower pace than other places. my mum goes into about the only chain store this town had at the time, a place that sells clothes, toys, beauty products, etc. she gets what she needs and goes to the counter (there is only one). the cashier is just standing there, chatting to her friend. "hello?" "hang on." she continues talking to her friend behind the counter. mum wants a minute. and another. and another. and another. and another. eventually mum walks away, hangs her items on the pegs/shelves, and then disappears to the back of the store. all the while, the cashier remains chatting to her friend behind the counter. mum eventually returns to the cashier counter (and yes, she's still busy chatting) but without the assortment of garments she was intending on purchasing. rather, the store manager. oh, and she knew the store manager. did i mention this was a small town? "so, what's been the problem?" "i was waiting here for five minutes. she just kept talking." now, i should remind you, this is a laid back town. but there's a difference between a few seconds wait for someone to finish their sentence and having someone arrogantly tell you to wait for five whole minutes. "oh, dear. what would you like me to do about it?" "fire her." suddenly the cashier broke out from her conversation. "what! you can't ask for him to fire me! you should have just waited." "i know another girl who would be perfectly happy to take your job, she needs the money. plus, she'd actually be capable of serving customers" mum replies. "okay [thezapzupnz's mum's name here]. [cashier], you finish in two weeks. now serve this customer now, and you [cashier's friend] can leave the store." i can't remember if mum got a discount or a free gift, but i do remember the firing. tldr; arrogant cashier doesn't serve customer for five minutes, gets fired by annoyed customer's request. edit: clarified language in response to noshoesnoshirt, thanks. i always try to remove ambiguity. i just couldn't see it myself.i've never shared this story with anyone. when i was 11, i was pretty timid. i wasn't bullied or anything, just generally quiet and soft-spoken. in my art class, i sat next to a girl who was both pretty and very annoying -- she was giggly and hyperactive all the time. still, she had a lot of friends while i mostly kept to myself. i can't remember how it started but she would *eat* the erasers from my pencils. she thought it was hilarious, and other people did too. i had a mechanical pencil, she stole it, took the eraser out and ate it, cracking up laughing. the first time, i just shrugged it off. but a mechanical pencil without an eraser is annoying! if i used a wooden pencil, same thing -- she'd chew it off. and we were in the middle of doing sketches, so i really needed a pencil and erase! so when she ate my eraser the next day, and the next, and every time i got a new pencil or an eraser, i was getting really sick of it. i asked her to stop, and she just laughed at me. everybody would always *encourage* her to do it. she did it until i had no erasers left, and she thought it was so fucking funny. thinking back now, i should've just told a teacher -- but i didn't want anyone to think i was a humorless baby telling on people, so i took my own personal revenge. for christmas, i asked for one of those long eraser pens, the one where an eraser shaped almost like string cheese goes inside a plastic container and is pushed out as it's used. i got one with several replacement erasers. i took one of them, put it in the bath tub, and peed on it. i let it dry and put it in the pen. i knew she would take care of the rest. sure enough when school started back up, and i pulled my eraser pen out in art class, she said, "oh, is that my christmas present?" giggling, she snatched it from me, pulled the eraser out and started chewing on. i just smiled and watched her devour the whole thing. maybe she finally got her fill of erasers (seriously, why was she eating them in the first place?) or maybe that one put her off erasers forever because she never stole another eraser from me.we used to have a couple living next to my parents' house who were very noisy. they'd usually invite people over for parties and stay up long in to the night, with fairly loud music playing. in summers they'd host their parties in their garden, which was overlooked by most of our house's bedrooms and they'd be laughing and shouting really loud. this went on for about a year. my dad had tried to talk to them several times and they'd always promise to be quiet next time, but next time would just be the same shit all over again. so i decided with my brother to carry out our revenge plan. our neighbours had recently bought a brand new pick-up truck, for which they were very proud from what we could gather. we used our garden hose to make mud out of a field opposite our house and then took that mud and coated the pick-up truck with it. we used my dad's tools to even it out (basically a couple of wood palets that are used on fresh cement to make its surface all smooth and even) and after a couple hours we had managed to create a big block of mud around the pick-up truck. we wrote on it: "shhhhh :)" we went back in, took showers and later that night our furious neighbours came over to ask us if we saw anybody messing with their pick-up truck. they didn't suspect us outright because nearly everybody in the neighbourhood was asking them to keep quiet, to the extend that some people had called the police on them a couple time. but they knew why it had happened and needless to say they mostly kept quiet after that.this happened last year on christmas day. my wife and i were visiting her brother for christmas and after all of the festivites were done we wanted to eat. they did not really feel like cooking, so we found out that mcdonald's was open. well after we pulled up to the glorious double arches of gold. we went inside and ordered our food. they were super busy and the wait times were pretty bad. i offered to wait for the food since my brother in law had his three daughters that wanted to play in the playhouse. as i was waiting i kept noticing a lot of ice on the floor. as i continued waiting i noticed it was two teenage girls throwing the ice about 17 &amp; 14 years old. they were giggling and carrying on. i ignored it until one pelted me in the head. i got my food and as i walked by and looked them dead in the eyes "quit throwing the fucking ice!" they stopped. we enjoyed our meal and time together. as i was leaving we filled our drinks up and left. as we were walking to the cars. the two girls from pulled up to me in a mustang. the younger one leaned her head out the passenger window and said, "sorry about the fucking ice!" my sister-in-law without even giving me a chance "sorry about the fucking ice bitch!" and empties her large soda right in the girls face. they both drive away with the girl in screaming tears. we laughed about it the entire night. **tl;dr: teenage girls being bitches, got a face full of soda.**alright i have a story of my shitty room-mate from 2 years ago. it was too pro for pettyrevenge so here it is. also, its long, hang in there. background on room-mate: my piece of shit room mate (pos from here on out) was horrible. he was going to college for no reason and was on a full ride through financial aid and bragged constantly about it. the problem with that is, his parents are millionaires and he makes a shit ton of money showing cattle while i am white and squarely middle class and get only $500 per year in financial aid while paying out of pocket and with loans. he also bought a brand new $40k truck while in college because he doesnt have to pay a cent for his college education, just to give you an example. well he gets shit grades, cheats on every assignment and test, and parties nightly especially on "thirsty thursday" (being an engineering student, i dont understand this tradition as i havent the time for it). he comes home black out drunk at 2 in the morning and is extremely loud, like windows shaking loud. he also drives in that condition. he is also a huge douche with house keep up. will not provide paper products at all ( i started hiding my tp as he'll go through a jumbo roll per day), will not clean, and generally makes a huge mess. he is also very abusive to his gf. i could go on but nah you get the picture. the offense: he was so shitty to everyone all the time this was just the straw that broke the camel's back. i and the other tenants (3 of us) picked a weekend to clean the house. everyone agreed, even pos did. then halfway through the week pos informs us that hell be leaving for the weekend so wont be able to clean (third time this has happened). he has also filled except for one shelf our fullsize fridge (only one in the house) with shitty beer. he also decides to thaw raw meat not on a plate and wrapped in nothing but a paper wrapping on top of all of our (he 3 other tenants) food (it obviously leaked through the paper and got all over our food and the fridge). we tell him to remove the beer before he leaves and to clean his shit up and replace our food that has been contaminated with raw meat. we remind him almost hourly of his for the rest of the week. friday comes around and by the time the rest of us get back from class, pos is gone. he has done nothing. we were pissed. the revenge: we cleaned the house that weekend anyway. we also took the thawed meat from the fridge and since his truck was still there (his gf drove that weekend) we grabbed his spare keys and spread that shit all over the engine. have fun when that puppy heats up. we then removed the beer (80 something cans) from the fridge and set it in our yard with a sign "free beer" and waited. 3/4 of the beer was gone by that night so we took the rest of it back inside and shook the shit out of every single can then hid them all over the house. we also replaced his pillow with cans of beer since he launches himself onto his bed. we then wait. pos returns and being the definition of stupid doesnt notice anything. goes to his room and flops onto his bed thunk "what the fuck!!!!! why is there beer in my pillow?!" we are dying laughing but manage to keep it quiet. he confrints us about it and we just tell him he should have moved his beer and not ditched cleaning, he never noticed most of it was missing. he was pissed as his tiny brain couldnt register hat he was supposed to clean too and in general pitch inand not be a douche. then came the kicker. throughout the week he kept complaining that his truck smelled awful and he cluldnt figure it out. well that thursday, he went out to get blasted again. we threw the free beer sign into the back of his truck with his beer. 2 in the morning rolls around and he busts through the door again near black out drunk bitching about how "some nigger stole my beer!" oh, i forgot to say he was also under age at the time. he then leaves to go to his gf's house driving himself again while drunk so we call into the cops wih his truck description and where hes headed as were sick of dealing with drunk pos and him endangering everyone else in the town. he gets busted, blows a ridiculously high bac and gets dui and an underage. the college drops his financial aid and he has to resell his truck to pay for college. justice is served ass-hole. now you get to live like the rest of us plebs. thanks for reading edit: to whoever ends up having to clean the engine bay on the truck, i am so sorry. edit 2: he also ruined the throwout bearing on the clutch in my car (18 year old manual trans civic, was getting fragile). he had to move it after i parked it at the very end of the single file driveway just after the sidewalk as he was apt to do to show him how annoying it was. instead of asking me to move it, he stole my keys (never put them back where they were. took 2 days to find them) and dropped a big cement block on my clutch to hold it in, moved the car and then left the block there for 2 days. prolonged pressure on the clutch pedal ruins the bearings. bitch to fix.(alternative title: the year i lost my fucking mind and turned into a psycho bitch) this story takes place over the course of 2 years with a person i think is probably a pedophile or has a loli-complex. it first began when i was 14. i met derrick when he was 17 in the hallway waiting for my mom to pick me up because i was sick. we started talking, and he offered to take me home in his truck because i looked as if i was going to pass out. on that ride home, i fell head over heels for him. he was good looking, we had similar interests, and he seemed to like me back. now, to give you some clarity, i had never had a boyfriend before this. i kissed my best friend in elementary school because of a coin flip, but i never did anything with anyone up until this time. before derrick, i was as nonsexual as you can be. however, i was a hopeless romantic, and a lonely nerd in a school where i didn't feel like i fit in. i had 1 friend, and i wasn't allowed to talk to her because of my parents. this probably explains why i was as easily manipulated as i was. derrick was a senior in high school, yet he focused a lot of attention on me. he made me a little mascot of the senior class, and i made a lot of friends this way. we also took the same math class at the time, college algebra. he would convince me to do both of our homework so he could finally pass the class. in my naivety, i agreed, making sure to change my handwriting and give him some wrong answers. i was the nerd, so this was nothing new to me. plus i wanted to keep him around. he asked me out 2 months after we met. this is where everything started going bad. first, derrick started trying to control how i looked. he hated my short hair. i would pull my bangs back in clips and put on a heavy amount of make-up, but he would still comment on how he felt he was with a 10 year old boy. he wouldn't talk to me if i wore the color yellow. he also made fun of my size. i was small (i'm still small to this day), and i hardly had any breasts to speak of. my mother bought my clothing and she would buy plain color low cut shirts, simply because they were the only ones we could get cheaply. one day, while hanging out behind the school with his friends, he yanked down my shirt by the collar, showing all his friends my small breasts. he yelled at them, "well at least your girlfriends have tits." his friends after that would call me the tit-less wonder, which would then spread around the high school for the rest of my high school days until i broke down and got a ged, but that's another story. he would also call me asian and make ching-chong noises at me. i have squinty eyes, yes, but i am not asian. i called him out on his bullshit there, but that also spread around to the point where i quit my job last year because a girl from high school harassed me about it. now, remember how i said i was nonsexual? he was over-sexual. derrick would give me rides in his truck, and during those rides, he would ask for a kiss, a french kiss. i agreed, thinking no harm no foul. then it escalated. he would stick his hands down my pants, feel me up as we kissed. i was uncomfortable, and i would usually tell him no until i broke down. then he wanted me to touch him, primarily on his penis. i told him no, and he threatened to throw me out of the car while he was driving. he threatened to leave me for sarah, a cheerleader and band geek. i finally agreed. nothing at that time went further than touching, but i was highly uncomfortable. he graduated that year, and we stopped talking. then, two years later, when i was 16 and he was 20, i found him again. we reconnected and i thought he had changed a lot. i was right in a way. he was a lot worse. derrick lived a trailer park by the high school, so i would go over there for a couple hours every day just to be with him. i never lost that head over heels factor for him. those days, my hair was longer and i dressed a little more girly. he would tell me to straighten my hair, how to do my make-up, call me ugly, tell me how flat i was, how i could never find anyone who would really like me like he did. he would sometimes tell me that he hated me and he would rather be with anyone else but me. i lost a lot of the confidence i had. i wasn't a loner anymore. he came between my friends. when my best friend passed in december due to suicide, he wouldn't let me go to the funeral because they were a "faggot" and they deserved to die. he threatened to leave me then. by then, i was broken enough to believe him. of course, there came the sex. i was still fairly nonsexual, but he would force himself upon me. it started with handjobs, which i thought it would stop there. then one day, out of nowhere, he forced himself in my mouth. i nearly clamped down using my teeth, but he shoved himself so far in that i vomited all over him. he pulled out and told me to do it again. this is also the person who took my virginity and told me how shitty i was at sex. one day, i was on facebook, and i saw a picture of him kissing another girl, sarah the cheerleader. i friended her, and i started going through pictures. they had been dating for 3 years, longer than i have been in the picture. everything slowly began to click in my head, the sex, the weird hours, the fact he never took me out, the calling me "baby" and "honey". and then i got mad. that night, i went over to his house. we had sex that night and then he went to sleep. he had two cars, his truck and a dodge challenger. he was in the middle of restoring that challenger, and it was beginning to look pretty. i usually sat with him while he was fixing them, so i knew somewhat what i was doing. i grabbed the bat he kept and smashed the windshield of that challenger with as much force as i could. i kept smashing it until it was almost gone. i smashed all the lights. i poured a monster energy drink where the oil goes. any sort of wires or tubes i saw, i ripped up. i went to the inside and i ripped his dashboard and threw it in the back. i ripped the leather seats he had just installed with a crafters knife and then poured another energy drink on the foam. i ripped up the leather on the steering wheel writing the word "pedo" on it. i destroyed the carpet with his soda and poured some on the radio. i shoved a can underneath the brake pedal. i broke the bat on his truck. i smashed everything i could there. i did the same thing i did with the challenger. i poured his sodas in the oil. i poured it three cans in his gas tank. i smeared dog shit from his dog shit bucket all over the inside, the carpet, the steering wheel, the seats, the pedals. i smashed every window, every light and attacked the body until the bat broke in half. then i punched it so hard i broke my hand. i keyed along the side of the truck, "cheater, liar, asshole, dick, pedo." i broke the back of the flatbed or whatever you call it so he could not haul anything around. i loosened his tires, hoping they would fall off. then i grabbed all his tools and shoved them in the neighbor's trash can. i also took his sets of keys and chucked them down the street. i blocked his number and walked home that day. while i was at home, i sent every picture i had of derrick and me and sent it to sarah. she wasn't going to leave him, she was pregnant, but i hoped to warn her. i also called his job and let his boss know that he was seeing a girl that was underage. i don't know exactly what happened after that point. i broke off all contact with him. i do know he married sarah and they have a little girl together. it's a small town so i do see him on occasion at my job. he pretends not to know me. i'm perfectly happy with that. tl;dr: i got fed up with a manipulative asshole, so i became a crazy ex. first time poster, long time lurker. this could be pettyrevenge, but i'll give my justifications afterwards. and this is just one of probably many stories to come. for those who know, and [this]( is going through your head based on the title, i like you already. so there i was, on my birthday at the stroke of midnight, just given a 3/4 day of paid time off from my eternally shitty job working 3rd shift at a factory. i think to myself "awesome! i'll go home and *maaaayyyybbbbeeee* get myself a birthday blowjob!". i mean, i've been dating her for the past 6 years, and have gotten one every year for my birthday. but there's always the chance i won't. no big deal. i walk in the door, all is quiet. which instantly strikes me as kind of strange, she usually watches tv at this time of night. maybe she just passed out? i think nothing of it. so i am walking back to our bedroom, when i hear it. the unmistakable headboard against the wall with slight, barely audible womanly moans coming from the bedroom, and promptly freeze.. after a few seconds i quietly sit down on the cold linoleum floor and think to myself... "she's cheating on me, on my birthday, on our bed, in the house that i pay rent! wtf?!" but, there's one thing that everyone who knows me, knows about me. i don't act rashly. ever. i think things through, and you really don't want to get on my revenge side. it's cold, and it's calculating... i have been referred to as spock on a number of occasions. so the plan is hatched for the instant revenge. she only likes to bang in the dark. i have really good dark vision. she does not. the house is pitch black. "i've got this" i mutter to myself. i quietly enter the bedroom, and proceed to head to the always open closet across from the bed, and proceed to grab our wooden studded paddle from it. he's still on top of her, continuing to go at it with a steadily increasing pace. it is everything in my power to hold back my infuriation with the situation... i grab the paddle, and a box that was on top of it proceeds to fall, making a very loud noise. i crouch down to stay hidden and think to myself "shit, here i am catching her cheating on me and i'm about to be the one that gets caught..." but... they don't stop. he's a madman on a mission to blow his load, which he's obviously very close to doing. i get to the end of the bed, and stand there in full batters swing, ready, waiting for the right moment. it was was quite an eternity waiting for a man that is screwing my girlfriend of six years, on my bed, in my house, on my birthday, to blow his load. and then it happens. he pulls out, and is about to pop on her stomach. i instantly realize she's doing this unprotected, and i spring out the full swing, now with added hatred of condomless oomph, and **whack!!!!!!!** that blood curdling wince and then eventual cry was absolute music to my ears. direct hit to the ass. she asks "what in the hell just happened?", his reply is "something just smacked my ass so hard i think i'm bleeding...." this is when i personally think it hit her. she frantically rushes to the side of the bed to flick on the bedside lamp. *click* and there i am, standing there tall and proud. safety glasses still on, holding what i have now dubbed the meat grinder in hand. staring down at the both of them with an unholy, unflinching gaze that is commonly referred to as the u.p. stare. a stare of psychic withdrawal inducing soul destruction. unwavering in its intensity. and then i focus my gaze directly into his eyes. calm as a statue, and officially shut down of all emotions by this point. it is now that i realize that the man screwing her, was a man that i've known for years. not necessarily a friend, but someone whom i trusted, and knew i trusted. and then i say, in an extremely giddy and overtly flamboyant gay tone. "who's up for a threeeeeeeessssoooooooommmmmmeeeeeeee?????" with an evil, cheekish grin afterwards i have never seen a man get his shit and get out the door so fast in my life. ever. it was per near instantaneous that he was gone. she looks at me. i look at her. and i say the inevitable truth. "you know that every single one of my past girlfriends has cheated on me, and you know exactly what that means..." "i'm dead to you huh..." she replies in a dejected, monotone voice of humility. "after you leave tonight, i will not recognize either of your existence if we meet again... i will more than likely never speak to you." while standing there, staring at her the whole time, she gets up, head hanging in shame. gathers clothes. gets in her car, and leaves. that's when everything in me just collapses. my heart, my soul, my emotions, my ego and pride... everything. i proceed to go to the living room, crack a beer, and cry for 8 hours. i'm a man, but i'm only human. the next day her mom calls me up and asks "what in the hell happened last night?" so i reply bluntly with this... **tl;dr "i discovered her sleeping with a someone i knew, snuck into the room, and proceeded to slap his ass as hard as i humanly could with our wooden studded paddle as he was coming on her stomach...**" she busts out laughing at her daughters stupidity, and my retaliation, and heads on over for a little bit more of a talk instead of on the phone. i still talk with her mom once in a while. i think i might call her tomorrow. but haven't said a word to cunty mccockbag, or anuspucker vondouchey since. after the fact i learned that he was not the only she cheated on me with either... i, genuinely, wish her nothing but the best and no ill will. she just won't be getting a single damn thing from me... from what i understand she hasn't been able to hold a job since, and is with that guy. (huge downgrade to boot) i will say i'm still healing about everything even nearly 2 years later now. i've been torn up entirely too much by women, and i just want that cycle to end. i'm taking my sweet ass time with getting back into the dating world. sure it's lonely sometimes. but i'd rather be lonely, then 10 years down the road at 40 and having this crap repeat all over again... reasons i figured this was pro over petty: swift, decisive, thought out and planned, "j uses butt bludgeoner.... it's super effective!!!", not a rash "i'm gonna end your bloodline meow!!!", something else i can't think of. anyways, hope you enjoyed this bit of a long post. tune in next time for: the horrible upstairs neighbors and the dog semen filled pillow! j out. 2 months later edit!: i was just informed that he cheated on her, repeatedly, is now single, and heartbroken. i actually spent the time to call her and have a chat. first thing she said? "now i know how you felt... i'm sorry j..." which, honestly sucks. on one hand i feel vindicated even more, on the other i wouldn't wish it upon anyone. even her. but this pretty much officially closes the story. what goes around comes around, and maybe. just *maybe*, we can be friends. it's been long enough and i absolutely do **not** want to get back together. that would be another nightmare all over again. time will tell. peace out guys. will get to the horrible upstairs neighbors and the dog semen filled pillow soon enough.several years back when myspace was still on top, my family came down to visit and stay at my mother's place for a few days. among them was my stoner racist idiot (is idiot redundant?) cousin. i had stopped by and at some point i got on her pc (on my account) and started doing some touch-ups on a website i was building for a local restaurant. something came up and i had to step out of the house for a bit. i did not set this computer up with passwords for the user accounts (still dumb, but i've since learned) as the only two people who have physical access to the computer were my mother and i. so just leaving my stuff logged in was never an issue, but i had failed to take into account the stoner racist idiot cousin. while i'm away he decides (for possibly the first time in his life) that he would like to read something. unfortunately he decided that it would take the form of snooping through my email, chat logs, and internet history (again it was my mom's pc, so his search for whatever crazy porn i might have been into was fruitless.) naturally when i get back he brags about how much of a l33t haxx0r he is by telling me about his recent exploits through my personal email, logs, etc... if he would have kept his mouth shut i might not have known. so as soon as possible, i went through and changed all my passwords. i couldn't take the chance that this little halfwit had access to websites i had built for myself and others (among other things.) in a way he really did do me a favor by showing me that i needed to be more paranoid about leaving accounts logged in and password security. ahhh yes, the revenge part, password security. my cousin had logged into his aim account while this was going on, it was set up to save login info. this particular version of aim was pretty bad at storing passwords securely. so after about 30 seconds worth of effort i had his password, which he used on every single account he had. i use this to see what he's up to on myspace. his profile is filled with pics and videos of girls in bikini's, alcohol, and pictures of hitler. that just isn't proper, so i changed it. hitler becomes martin luther king jr., girls making out turn into men, slipknot videos turn into bob ross instructional videos. the cherry on top was his slipknot fansite being turned into a "my little pony" fansite. at this time there was no such thing as a brony. i was thinking about changing it back (minus the racist/sexist crap) after he apologized so i made backups. to be quite honest, i was probably just telling myself that to allay my own guilt over changing his settings. but then... hitler... naturally when he goes to log in he sees the changes and flips out. he jumped to conclusions and mistakenly thought other kids in his high school were behind the defacement. he started a fistfight during school, which ended up being the last straw for his school's administration (he has a history), and got himself expelled for the rest of the year. at this point i was still ready to change stuff back (and keep in mind i hadn't changed his passwords) when he figured out it was me and sent me this message... "umm ya i dont know why the fuck you did but i want you to unlock all my accounts u hacked and put the back to the way they were before u fuckin touched them" so... no i don't like threats at all. at this point his password seemed like it was enslaved to just two people... like it needed to be freed, see the world and all. so somehow it got posted to a forum my friends and i visited. it quickly when to nsfw town and within a few days his accounts were banned. afterwards he told me he was most upset about losing his "rare" slipknot jpegs. found one screencap, lost the nsfw ones. [screencap]( **tldr: special-needs neo-nazi gets his myspace sanitized, starts fights in high school, gets expelled.** as above [x-post /r/pettyrevenge], as it was suggested it belongs here :-) following a line of traffic in town ( about 20 mph)and the lane to the left of me was a left turn filter. the motorbike who had zoomed up behind me at a fair speed decided he wanted to overtake me , and went down the left turn lane and then popped out in front of me far too close ( and yes im a biker so i do know). i flashed my lights at him (once) and he freaked out at me turning in the saddle to give me the finger. now fair enough do it once,-- but he carried on doing it, shouting ( from inside his helmet doh!) and shaking his fist at me and (this is important) -not paying attention to the road in front. i saw my opportunity :) i opened my eyes, dropped my jaw, gripped the wheel and slammed on my brakes. then came the best moment of my life as i saw the dawning realization in his eyes as he imagined what i was braking for -which must be in front of him. my words cannot do justice to his frantic attempt to turn his body, snatch at the handlebar, brake hard and steer all at the same moment whilst is brain was engaged at trying to figure out the emergency. just as well i was already braking as the subsequent swerve , wobble, flip and bounce on the floor in front of everyone was a joy to my heart. honest-- i did try not to be giggling when i drove past him struggling to pick up his bike when i was 25, i moved into a house out in portland oregon barely knowing anyone in the city. i needed a roommate, so i craigslist-ed an ad and conducted a small set of interviews to fill the extra room. a guy named travis moved into the room eventually. he was younger than me by about 4 years, but he had a consistent job and seemed reasonable so i took him. moving in three weeks later, i find out he lied about everything in the interview. he had no job. his dad paid his rent. he had a click of collar-popped douche bags that would hang out at the house all day. i had invited in a self proclaimed "playa" into the house. face to face, he would be nice to me in his sly way. when i left the house, he would subtly search through my room and steal petty shit - a used fax machine, quarters out of my change jar, outdated mp3 player, old watches he found to be "baller", etc. i confronted him a few times, and he would always deny it. when i caught him openly eating my food and denying it, i attempted to kick him out. he stayed by citing his tenant's rights. because most of it was petty, i decided to look the other way while his ego grew bigger. things died down for a few weeks. one day i come back home from work and travis had stolen the only shirt i knew he would steal from my closet. it was a two year old lacoste shirt. when he had the nerve to wear it in front of me, i decided this was the final straw. giving him his last way out, i decided to ask him: "hey, i have that same exact shirt in my closet." i figured if he had any soul left, he would simply say "i borrowed it from your closet". he decided to lie about it telling me he had gotten it from the mall a few days ago. the audacity! the sociopath switch in my head decided to flip on. i knew travis thought i was too pussy to ask for the shirt back. he thought i was a doormat, and i was going to play directly into that. i understood the mindset of a young 20 something "alpha male". travis' birthday was coming up in about a month and a half (he made it known because he told me his mom was going to get him a new burberry shirt) and i was going to make that the day i strike. i played into his fake friendly-ness and started hanging out with him. i made friends with his douche bag friends. when they started calling me, i knew i had them. i'd buy them occasional drinks when we were out to seed my future plans of generosity. birthday comes. game time. travis had an obsession with doing cocaine over the last few months. nothing big since he was broke, so most of his binge's were in small amounts. i pulled him over in the middle of the day and told him i had a birthday surprise for him. to pump up his ego more, i told him i only did this for the best of my "boys". we go out for a night of drinks. i buy him enough drinks to get him shit housed and we head back to the house for the after party. i had called a few females over during the night to make the after party request legit. when we get to the house, i walk out of my room with half an eight of cocaine in my hands. "travis! this is the surprise you've been waiting for!" i dump a mound of white onto a black plate and spelled his name out on it. i was going to take a picture of travis hitting the fattest line of cocaine in existence- with his name one it. with his name laid out in cocaine over a black plate, the stage was set. i hand travis a rolled up twenty, and told him to hit it. the pandemonium behind his back built the pressure cooker need to push him into doing it. as travis sucked his head down to the plate, i told him to give me a party pose next to his special surprise. travis produced the single best duck face pose i had ever seen. one hand holding the rolled up twenty, and the other to throw his white boy downward deuce. gotcha. the next morning, everyone was flaccid. the girls had left about an hour after we reached the house, and the chemical leftovers of the alcohol and cocaine destroyed any productivity planned within the house. i call up my friend nick to induce the second part of the plan. nick was labeled as my russian body guard. he was 6'5, and weighed in at about 280 pounds of pure muscle. when nick arrives, me and him go into travis' room and drag him by his legs into the living room. travis was startled, but barely awake. i bring him a laptop with the picture i had taken last night of him. "you are looking at a picture i took of you last night. i've already uploaded it into a image hosting site, and copied this picture into a couple of safe places. there is no erasing this picture. understand?" "yes" "you're job right now is to prevent this from getting sent to your parents. the only way prevent this from getting sent to your parents is to pay for the coke i bought you last night, and move the fuck out." because travis did not have a car, i gave him rides to his parents work and place of residence. i also knew a few of the addresses of where his friend's parents lived (google!). travis was scared shit-less of his dad. if i had threatened to send any details of his fast life to his dad, travis would obey everything. in the end, i had travis pay $400 dollars for the half eight i had only paid $50 for. travis moved out of the house within the same day. about 3 months after the situation, i moved out of the house we shared. i sent the picture to his parents. to his parent's bosses. to all his parent's neighbors. then to all the friend's parent's addresses. the cost? about $250 dollars. all paid for ala' travis. **i do have proof. picture is around on one of my computers, and i'll post that in the update if people are interested.** tl;dr talked my clepto, thief of a roommate into buying a sack coke and having me take a picture of him doing a line of cocaine with his name spelt out on it. which then i used the picture to blackmail him with. then using the money i extorted from him, i sent the picture to everyone his parents knew. **delivery update** **picture has been officially uploaded at suck it haters!**i got super bored at work and decided to just make it. so here it is, /r/regularrevenge i made it literally about ten minutes ago, so if people actually want it, i'll go ahead and make it a little more serious in terms of rules and what's allowed or not allowed, as well as bring mods from the main revenge subs if they so like. for now, let's just see if it's even well received by the communities. edit: i have added flair in the /r/regularrevenge sub in order to comply with /u/badgerchemist's idea. i hope this is a welcome choice, and please feel free to share any ideas you have about changing or helping the subreddit in the stickied post over there.this is an oldie, so the details may be a little vague, but only just found this sub. many years ago i entered into my first mobile phone (cell) contract with a large telecommunications company here in the uk. i signed for a 24 month term, and also signed for an odd on to the contract that gave me extra data at a small additional charge. this add on was not contracted, i simply had to give notice of cancellation a few days prior to the payment date and the payment would not be taken and the add on would expire at the end of the billing period. after a couple of months i provided the notice of cancellation, and received confirmation that i would no longer be charged. i think no more of it and live my life happily. at the end of the contract i log into my account management website to confirm that i wish to cancel and don't want to rollover onto a new plan. here, i notice that i am still being charged for the add on that i cancelled. i look through my history and notice that 17 months of payments had been taken after the cancellation. thats almost £170 that i hadn't wished to pay. the next day i phone their customer service department who informs me that they can see that it was due for cancellation, but could not explain why the cancellation was never actioned. they were very apologetic but explained that i should log a complaint via email and it would be looked into. i do just that, and after a lot of chasing around and being sold excuses such as "outstanding system issues that prevented the cancellation and were still unresolved" to "not following the correct cancellation procedure so the add on was not cancelled". after a lot of back and forth i grow tired of explanations and just cut to the chase: "can i get a refund of the 17*£9.99 charges that i was not expecting to pay and was informed would be cancelled. please issue to this account {acc info}.". i attached the previous mail that i had received at the time of cancellation, as evidence. they still refused to issue a refund, and instead offered me 1 month of free add on. not acceptable. i did some digging and found their customer services director's email address and cc's him into my response, which read the same as the above email. i received the following reply: "hi doydoy. thanks for contacting us, and apologies for the confusion caused. we will immediately issue a credit to your account for the amount of £170 as a good will gesture. regards, xyz". the reply did no longer have the director listed as a cc, so i guess i scared the normal adviser into action. however, by this point 6 weeks or so had passed since i initially logged my complaint, so i was a little pissed. i responded with: "thanks xyz, i appreciate the good will gesture. however, as i have been incorrectly charged for a service i did not wish for, and a service i had understood to be cancelled, i believe i am entitled to a fill refund of the services paid. as such, please refund the full £169.83 to the same account". i received a very short reply: "i have issued a refund notice which should be processed in 14 working days. thanks". felt bad for the guy who simply forgot to use the correct wording when issuing me with the initial payment, but by this time i was frustrated and just wanted the money. i enjoyed the extra 170 they gave me. tldr: company failed to stop charges to my account, i received a "good will gesture" in place of a refund, pushed for a refund as well as the good will gesture and earned £170 for my efforts. background: i am a sysadmin for a web dev/marketing company. for those who didn't know, yesterday was 'sysadmin appreciation day' where coworkers are encouraged to give appreciation to their sysadmins. one of my coworkers, let's call him matt, is smart, slighty arrogant, egotistical and a bit of a dick. he **loves** to tease and annoy people as a joke and he'll happily let it go into harassment if he can get away with it. on the flipside, if you do anything to him, hoo boy he doesn't take it well. tl;dr: he can dish it but he can't take it. anyway, so yesterday he was looking forward to some appreciation from the rest of the company as he believed he deserved it (and he let us all know this). which he does to a degree because he has been doing a lot of the shit work - we've been secretly assigning those tickets to him :p over the course of the day we did get a lot of thanks from our colleagues but one of the project teams came down with beer and [cake]( (had to hide the project name due to the nda) in thanks for all the work we've done for them. well, by 'we' they actually meant me (and they said as much) as i had been the sole sysadmin working on the hellish project. the rest of the team had no issue with this (because they knew how much hell i'd gone through working on it) but matt didn't like this one fucking bit. the only present we get and he couldn't have any of it? insufferable! so he became very vocal about this and insisted that the cake was actually for all of us (not that he cared about the others). i was planning on sharing anyway but looking at how he was acting i saw my chance to piss him off. revenge for all the false rumours he spread to make my life difficult, revenge for all the times he'd randomly tamper with my linux shell settings right before project deadlines, revenge for all the other things he'd done to piss me off for his shits and giggles). i insisted that the cake was only for me and that he should fuck off. he started calling me a 'greedy cunt' and a 'fat bastard' and a bunch of other things. he insisted on some cake because he had done some work on the project as well. he had actually, but it was so minor no one remembered or cared. except for him, right now, because he wanted some cake. so i laughed and said, "sure, okay, here's your piece" and threw some icing at him. he got even more angry at me and i explained that it was proportional to his contribution to the project. he got so angry he tried insulting me more but it came out in a splutter and he stormed off mumbling something about getting lunch. when he left the rest of us burst into laughter at how childish he was acting. we decided to prank him even more so we took photos of us eating all the cake and only left one plate (on my desk) to make it look like i had eaten all of it while he was away. i also knew that he'd start to play the victim and try get others on his side. so, i sent out an email to the company explaining the prank and asking that they play along and ignore any rantings from him. turns out it was a good move as he'd already started texting several people about me being a 'greedy bastard' and that "this is why you shouldn't give rohei anything" so when he came back he was still petulent and sulky and stayed like this for the rest of the day. it wasn't helped by other victims of his deciding to get some revenge and coming down with donuts, chocolate, etc just for me :p this was completely unintended and a masterful stroke on their part because he stayed so upset that he stormed out of the office the minute it hit 17:30. he didn't even take any of the free beer and he's normally all over free alcohol. jesus, how we laughed when he had left. who knew that the cooler-than-you matt would get so upset over something like cake? i sure as hell didn't and i hope he enjoys the photos of us eating the cake that are in his inbox :) **edit:** and how did the cake taste? delicious :d **edit 2:** so, yesterday he came in an saw the pictures and seemed to take it pretty well. he laughed at them and admitted that we got him good. i think he realised that he was being a stupid twat about the whole thing (i mean, it's only cake for crying out loud). however, i'm still keeping my guard up as this may be a ruse, to be honest :/ &gt; when george lucas tried to expand his production company studios in california’s wealthy marin county, the community pushed back. then the “star wars” creator wanted to sell the land to a developer who would build affordable housing. &gt;“it’s inciting class warfare,” carolyn lenert, then head of the north san rafael coalition of residents, told the new york times at the time. &gt;now, two years after that project stalled, lucas has decided to build the affordable housing and pay for it all himself. &gt;“we’ve got enough millionaires here. what we need is some houses for regular working people,” lucas said through his lawyer gary giacomini, cbs affiliate kcbs reported. **tl;dr:** millionaire neighbors didn't let lucas build a studio. he gets them some low-income neighbors and kills their property prices.i come from a family of professional pranksters. getting revenge be it petty or plotting an ocean's 11 style caper is in my blood. this happened back in the 80's with my aunt (j) and mom pulling heists on each other. my mom had just pulled a massively evil prank on j by tying a fake rubber snake to the lid of one of those [wicker basket hampers]( on a visit to her place. j is deathly afraid of snakes and this caused her a near heartattack from fright. to get her revenge, j recruited the aid of some neighborhood friends and waited for when my mom left for the afternoon shopping. she uses her key to open our house and move all of the furniture (couches, tables, chairs, tv and tv stands, book shelves, coffee tables. literally everything that touched the floors) onto the several trucks waiting outside. two or so hours later, my mom comes home with my little sister and i in tow and opens the door. she just stands there to a completely empty living room, family room and entryway. she panicks! * m: "omg, we've been robbed!" j had even recruited our cop neighbor (officer s) to be waiting outside washing his car. back in the 80's, you didn't just immediately dial 911 as this wasn't a life threatening emergency. my mom goes over to officer s and explains the story. he will help her but they would have to go down to the station for a lengthy report... best drop the kids off some place (this is part of the plan). my mom knows that j is home with her kids (summer time) so she piles us in the car to drive to the next neighborhood over. as there are lots of rolling hills where we live, my mom turns the bend to j's street to see an unusually large amass of cars parks outside of her house. in fact it looks like a large gathering out in front complete with chairs, tables, couches, desks.... as my mom pulls up still not registering what was going on (being that she just got robbed and all), it hits her "*hey, that couch looks like my couch, that table is almost exactly like mine...*". 15 neighbors are all cheerily looking at the "yard sale" my aunt j was having with my mom's furniture. j has the biggest grin on her face and mouths "gotcha!". a couple of years ago, i was driving my brand spanking new airconned mound of steel, aluminium and dead cows along a local road when i got overtaken by adam asshat, a juvenile delinquent, wannabe-gangsta in a pos car. you may know the kinds of person and car i'm talking about: the wheels are a once-formidable street-legal version of a rally-car, poorly maintained and ravaged by previous owners, who ended up "tuning" the poor machine with various pieces of tupperware and refuse duct-taped to it to give anyone who looks at it the idea it is a proper monster - albeit that the illusion doesn't last any longer than two seconds, except for the visually impaired of course. as a rule, such cars are infested with members of a troglodytic group of wasted humanity, wearing burberry caps and (usually fake) louis vuitton trinkets while they're cruising around with a cell-phone glued to their ear (an offense that will soon be punishable by death, or so i hear) and hollering insults at anybody who fails to yield to the hollow "broaaaap" emanating from the sewer-pipe that they use as a "sporty exhaust". well, one of these shitbags driving a shitbag takes over (across a white line) and proceeds to jam his car between me and the person in front of me. i instinctively subject my new car's abs to an impromptu field-test and proceed to flip my shit as per standard operational procedure. barney bastard doesn't even seem to notice.... come the next red light, yours truly and charlie cuntmange end up next to each other. i roll down my powered window and advise the little cunt to refrain from such actions for the foreseeable future. donny dipshit proceeds to laugh and roll his windows back up. the lights turn green and off he goes, gunning that rustbucket of his for all he's worth (which, in my humble opinion, would be less than his kidneys would fetch me on the black market, but i digress). from here on, we're at a two-lane road. i drive here daily and know this road like the back of my hand. i know that we're in a so-called "green wave" area, meaning that the lights are timed for 50 kmph. i also know that there's another traffic light some 200 yards further down the road. this, together with some other knowledge of this stretch of asphalt, makes that a plan begins to take shape in my head. rear view mirror: no cops. sides: no cops. i ram down on the accelerator and within seconds i'm back next to him - grinning like a madman. we stand at a red light, glaring at one another. eddy excrement adjusts his seat, sits up and revs his engine. i set the traction control on my 45.000 euro piece of japanese ingenuity to "sport". he tightens his seatbelt and tells his mate to brace. a faint smile plays on my lips as i fiddle with the buttons on my steering column, revving the engine to answer his challenge. he stubs out his cigarette and, after leering at me one more time, focusses on the traffic light. i do the same thing, keeping the 2.2 liter turbodiesel engine under my estate's bonnet at 1750 rpm, my gear in first and the clutch down. the tension is mounting - it's a carfight at the ok corral! i hear an eagle shriek, while tumbleweeds blow across the street and dramatic music by ennio moricone plays. the light turns green.... i firewall the throttle and gone are all fantasies of dueling at high noon - i am now biggles the fighter-pilot, ready to take out this messerschmidt! the clutch comes up, the engine unleashes its 180+ hp's of power and its 400+ n/ms of torque, not so much pulling me along earth as it seems to push the earth itself away from underneath it! i ram down the clutch, second gear! my car sounds like a roaring tyrannosaur, about to pounce on its quarry, while freddy fuckwit's pos subaru does - i hate to admit - keep up quite good. the difference is marginal at best.... we're doing 60 - 70 - 80 kmph, in a matter of seconds. i am taking a small lead now, i can win this! and then my cars craps out on me.... my car won't go any faster. the sound has changed, the raging dinosaur has becomea well-fed kitten, purring in satisfaction. my head snaps right and i see triumph in gary goatse's eyes as he peels away from me, accelerating to as he goes. i swear, he must've been doing at least 140 kmph when i saw the tell-tale double flash reflected in his rear window. i let the car roll out, passing the speed camera that had been placed there less than a week before, at a leisurely and legal 50 kmph. pulling up next to him at the next traffic light - no longer in the green zone now- i rolled down the window again and leaned out, explaining how modern cars had all sorts of nifty gadgets, for instance the possibility of setting a "do not exceed"-speed through the electronic throttle. fyi: exceeding the speed limits by 110 kmph in a built-up area carries a fine of around 500 euros. tl:dr - chav cut me off, i got him to race me on a road when i knew a speed camera was installed.let's just start this out with “i was a stupid teenager when this happened. if i knew now the potential damages i could have done then, i wouldn't have done anything....oooor, i might have done something less ridiculous”. also? this is a silly wall of text. alright, i was working at an overnight camp as a teen. the kids there stayed overnight for one month at a time. there were 2 counselors and 8 children in each cabin. i was a counselor for a group of 4th graders. overall, they were fairly amazing kids(i got to wake up at 8am, and then spend the next 14 hours running about like a crazy person with a posse made of very short people. it kicked all sorts of ass). the problem always happened at meals. at the camp, in addition to 30 cabins of fairly awesome children, there was a group of maintenance workers. all but one of them were kick-ass dudes, but the last one was less than ideal. my cabin ate at the same table every meal(they were assigned tables), and one table away there was the maintenance crew. at the maintenance table, there were like 30 ridiculous hot sauces. like “blah blah blah, if you put this in your eyes, you'll go blind” level hot sauce. painful, monstrous hotsauces. now, every time i left the table to go to the bathroom, or take a kid outside when he's having a meltdown, or any sort of counselor-y thing, i'd return to the table, and something of mine would likely be coated with hot sauce, and i'd discover it after ingesting the hot sauce. basically, a month of humiliating, belittling shit that was undermining my ability to lead this pile of 4th graders, combined with a month of me saying “goddammit, mr. a, don't do this bullshit, not only is it bullshit, but it also makes the counseling less easy”. this turned into a large pile of him goddamn not listening to me, or his boss(the head of the maintenance crew was a goddamn amazing guy/former sergeant/amazing human being that kept the entire camp running, due to being a legitimate badass that was just living at a camp he loved for years-and-years-and-years). at the end of the month, i was sick to my back teeth of mr.a's ridiculous bullshit. i had just stood up to get a cup of coffee, came back to my spoon coated in “some ridiculous pile of spicy bullshit”. i calmly(erm...as calmly as i could with a mouth full of burning pain) went up to him and his boss, and stated that this was ridiculous. i'd eat whatever the fuck hot-sauce he wanted, if he'd then match me piece-for-piece in mildly caffeinated mints. he agreed to this challenge infront of his boss, the badass former-seargant really cool guy that'd been my friend for the past few years. at this time, i was enjoying a caffeine tolerance of the sort that you only get from 2 years of 72 hour no-sleep benders that i used to get through all of school. gallons of coffee each day. like..multiple pots of coffee each day. at my car, i had a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge pile of loot from think geek. like..40$ of caffienated mints that i was using to keep up with a pile of 4th graders. so.......i then at 3 gigantic spoonfuls of ridiculous hot sauce, then politely excused myself, and walked to my car, with my mouth full of fire, sorta seething with goddamn rage. i go, grab eight packs of caffeinated mints(foosh mints. 1200mg per packet), and return back to the dining hall. i then place four packets of mints infront of mr. a, and just start snarfing down the other 4 packets. mr. a eats 1 single mint, and looks like he's going to puke. the awesome sergeant boss of his just takes one look at him, and starts laughing, stating that “both of you did shake on this”. with a defeated look, mr. a goes back to the mints. so mr. a takes like...20 minutes to finish the mints, and we both enjoy 4.8 goddamn grams of caffiene. i, due to my hideous caffeine habits at that time am able to shake off the mints in a night. he has heart palpatations, has to go get his stomach pumped, and is hung over as fuck for the next 3 days. at that point, i never had a day with hot sauce on my food. i saw him again like...ten months later, i felt bad about poisoning him, but we laughed about it, due to both of us eating the pile of delicious mints. tl:dr....i sorta poisoned an acquaintance, and then we were cool after that edit: at that time, i didn't really realize how insanely dangerous 4+ grams of caffeine could be to someone without a tolerance. i've always been what most would call a "fat" kid. and, as such i have been tormented and bullied for most of my life. anyways, a few days ago i got back at a kid who was one of the main people bullying me. my friend owned a "vape" (or vaporizer), and brought it to school with him regularly, and a week ago, he dropped it and it fell through the bottom of his locker and into the douchebags below him (he has gym on the opposite days as us) and my friend asks him about it, thew kid says he'll give it back, but a week later we find out he sold it to someone else. so, naturally, we "accidentally" poured a whole carton of milk into his locker. and now it will sit there. all through our week and a half long break, but, did i go too far? tl;dr kid stole my friends vape, i poured chocolate milk into his locker to ferment over break. edit: we made it to the front page!this story takes place a couple years ago, but it's probably my most satisfying story of revenge. many years ago i was big into world of warcraft. i specifically liked something called model editing, which is a term for a type of hacking where you change client-side files to modify the client-side experience only (mostly aesthetic stuff, but some things which affect the server side that i never messed with because i didn't want to get banned). i was a member on some forums for this type of thing where people shared their projects with the community. i saw it as a form of art, pretty much. a couple years ago (~2010) i hadn't played world of warcraft for some time and my account was inactive, but i decided to go back and check some old threads i posted and reread old comments on the model editing forums (for nostalgia purposes only). instead of navigating through the website to find my old posts, i just did a google search to find it. the top hit was a thread on some forum i'd never heard of, but with my exact same title, text, and pictures. i of course decided to do some snooping and found that this person had reposted just about every single thread i had posted without giving me credit at all, as if he had created them himself. interestingly, they were all fairly new posts too. i was pretty annoyed, but figured that there wasn't really anything i could do. the download link he posted had long since been taken down by the hosting website, and even if it still worked the model edit wouldn't have been compatible with the many years newer version of wow, and yet he was still getting positive comments and upvotes. the only option i could see was to post a few annoyed comments on some of his posts about how he was stealing my work. after getting no response, i decided that i would go to my photobucket account and remove the old pictures, so essentially his threads would be saying "look at this model edit i did!" followed by zero pictures and a download link that doesn't work. however, when i got there, i found a much more satisfying option. apparently photobucket allows you to edit your pictures and then replace the original file with the newly edited one. armed with this new resource, i overlayed some text on one of the pictures in his newest thread giving credit to myself and posting a link to the original thread and forum. within hours, there were negative comments showing up on all of his threads about how he's a plagiarist. he quickly took down my edited picture and posted a short credit to me at the bottom of his post, but the damage was done. people started posting original links in other threads that he'd stolen. from what i can tell, he eventually became a bit of a pariah. here's the original thread: here's one i made a couple minutes ago for verification: a long time ago in a state far far away (a college town in a mid-western state in the early 80's) our little pizza shop had a big problem with a couple of frat houses. actually, a lot of the pizza and delivery places had problems with the frat houses that was in all likelihood a big problem with a few bad apples -- but there were a couple of houses that seemed to have an even higher ah quotient. the issue for us was related to our 30 minutes or free policy (long since discontinued) and the thought that with some trickery and lying, you might be able to get a pizza without handing over any cash. since we were anal about times -- and did in fact give away pizza when it was late, the occasional smart-ass that tried to get a free pizza without having it be late got exactly what was coming to them -- usually a visit from the cops if they got too out of hand (a stern rebuke from a manager was usually enough though). but one house in particular seemed to have quite a few bad orders. sometimes i would come into work and there would be a note by the phones for this particular house (let's just call it aσς). the note would say something like "we are no longer taking orders from anyone in the aσς frat." on really rare occasion: "tonight we're not taking orders from any frat." yeah, they were that problematic -- note, i have nothing to compare this to (maybe some other pizza people want to share, i'm curious if this is still going on or was commonplace). one night in particular, one of our drivers comes back from aσς, not just with the un-purchased pizza, but with piss all over him. seems he got to the house on time, and rather than go through the usual "i'm a real dick and want to challenge your time, even though it's been like 10 minutes", they simply refused to open the door. it was a two story house and this guy was persistent, when he went to a side door they opened a window above him and dumped it on him. making things worse, this driver was a hard working, redneck-looking kind of guy -- everyone in the shop loved working with him. he had a great attitude and was the kind of person who'd be there for you if you needed him. dumping piss on him was the last straw. so the manager calls the cops and they drive over to the ole' aσς frat house and the stage is set. the door is answered by a lone aσς member who comes across as just your honest hardworking college guy who's really sorry for the confusion. the cop inquires if he's aware that someone dumped piss on the driver -- and this guy conveys that yes, he's aware, and they're all really sorry, they didn't mean to do it, it was a college prank gone bad. "awe shucks" kind of manner. cop: "which person here did it?" awe shucks hem haws around and finally confesses that, in fact, it was he, the poor hardworking college guy that did it, and he's really really sorry. so my manager looks at the cop, and more or less conveys that it's time to throw the book at awe shucks. they slap the cuffs on him, and to his frat-mates dismay, he's tucked into a squad car, and everyone heads down to the local police station for a booking that will involve a weekend in jail, or someone bailing this guy out -- it's not going to be something a simple apology solves, in other words. they're taking this guys confession when a car-load of aσς frat guys arrives at the station, asking to see the cop that's doing the intake paperwork. my manager is still there with the driver, and this is where the revenge portion really kicks in. this wasn't even planned, and i can only imagine that the cops were really sick of the aσς frat bs, because what happens next would have been awesome to catch on cell phone video (believe it or not, there was a time when such things were not commonplace). two of the arriving aσς party are having a rare moment of guilty conscience, and proceed to confess to the officer that it's not awe shucks who dumped the piss, but in fact, it was them. the cop proceeds to take their confession down, verifies on all ends that, yes, in fact, it was these two clowns, and not awe shucks, who dumped the piss. everyone is in agreement. so they book the two guys and put them in jail for the night (by this time it's well past midnight). then awe shucks, after lamenting about how he wishes it wouldn't have come to this (why wouldn't we all just accept an apology for this? it was just a harmless prank?), goes to leave. "where are you going?" says the cop. "i'm free to go, aren't i?" says awe shucks. cop proceeds to book awe shucks for some kind of false witness charge, and he joins his two buddies for the night. later that night a bunch of mindless vandalism happens to the aσς house -- sometime in the wee hours of the morning -- say after some late night pizza people are done cleaning their store. from what i remember, it involved some kind of construction bridge paint being applied to the bricks and windows of their house -- it's been a while and i wish i could have seen the application -- i just remember seeing the house for weeks, messed up with big block letters and paint on the windows. and it doesn't really end there -- the university ended up revoking the aσσ's right to have a house on campus. this happened awhile ago. it was back when i was in high school. there was this guy that would hang out with my group of friends, but it seemed like no one really liked this guy. even though no on really wanted him around he would always somehow figure out where we were at. anyhow, this guys was constantly an asshole to me making off-hand comments and jibes at me all the time. it was around the time that every one of my friends was getting their driving license and just starting to drive. at this time there was some friendly window chalking of each other's cars. nothing harmful, just if you saw a buddies car you would write something on their windshield like: got you bitch. something like that. fast forward a couple of months, and that asshole gets my car. he doesn't use window chalk though. he pours syrup on my car, and rubs candles on my windows/windshield. it was a cold night so the syrup froze on my car, and the only way to get the candle wax off of windows is with a razor. i find out that it was the asshole that did this to me, and i swear revenge. my car back then was a junker that i didn't really care about, but the assholes car was a 2 year old jeep. so, the next weekend one of my buddies is having everyone over to his house to play poker. now poker is the assholes favorite game to play, so i know he will be there. when my buddy calls to invite me over, i decline feigning sickness. i plan on getting my revenge that night. since the asshole has an idea that i will try and get revenge he gets my buddy to let him pull his jeep inside his garage. so when i get there i check all the doors to the garage, they're locked. i then do a little reconnaissance, and find that everyone is in the basement playing poker. then i sneak in the front door, and creep into the garage with my bag of goodies. there is the jeep. i proceed to dump: cheese sauce, salsa, syrup, chocolate syrup, cooking oil, bird seed, and planting soil. i also fully covered every one of his windows in green candle wax. i then slinked away, and went home. the best part was apparently eveyone stayed the night at my buddies, so the asshole didn't get to his car for around 10-12 hours. apparently the combination of all that stuff messed up his paint job a little bit, and he had to get it redone. he also suspected it was me, but couldn't ever prove it. he threatened me with law suits, but never filed one. i know this isn't as good as most of the ones i've seen on here, but i felt like badass when i did this.i took a job as it assistant for a local firm and the boss (it manager) we shall call him pa for passive aggressive or positively arrogant if you prefer. pa had been with the company for about 17 years. during this time he wrote a custom web solution involving thousands of files, as well as a hardware solution that was almost completely lacking in documentation let alone adequate documentation. i should have suspected something was up when he took me into a server room with a sea of ethernet cables labeled only on one end leading into various holes in the wall. when i asked what was the meaning of the cryptic numbers on the cables (a1- a4 for example) and was referred to topical map with only eight numbers and nothing else i knew i was in trouble. at least he made an attempt to write some wikis about how to do this or that but they were so vague all they would do was serve for his reminders but would not work for anyone else. before me he had hired a procession of assistants only to have them let go for "no rhyme nor reason" according to a co-worker. he would belittle me for taking so long to do tasks telling me i should take "calculated risks" about what i was supposed to do but programmers are taught to be thorough and to not take risks with company data by doing things you are not sure of. he would be rude and insulting when had no time to guide me or help me understand his custom system. i have to admit his code was great but his attitude was guaranteed to put anyone off from wanting to ask him anything. towards the end of the job there i was so stressed out it was literally killing me. people would remark that i looked white as a sheet and ready to drop. i could not sleep at night and i had to crawl to the bathroom because i would black out trying to walk at night. well after a year he decided he was going to take a vacation and leave everything to me for a month. he also sprung on me an unannounced project of importing data to be done in two and a half hours on the first monday after he left. the data import alone took about four hours so how in the hell he thought i could do this huge data import in the time expected was beyond me. the day i was let go he told me that i was not a good fit for the company and they let me go with severance pay which was nice but during the interview he cited three projects i did not get done in time and after i left i realized that one of them was a project he told me to stop working on, and another was a project to upgrade some software they had spent money on but i discovered bugs in the software and was told to not install it till the bugs were fixed. it took the makers of the software six weeks to fix the bugs and i got commendation from them and the president of the company i worked at for being very helpful in tracking down the bugs. after i got home i realized pa let me go blaming me for late projects he told me to delay on! i also began to remember all the insulting things he said and i began to figure it out. this delay in figuring out what happened is a feature of ptsd. i was friends with the owner of the company and i wrote him an email about the issues. i told him how he keeps hiring people to do it assistant yet required them to already know the custom system he built over a period of 17 years. i mentioned how he refused to help new hires familiarized themselves with the code - heck it was only after 10 months that i was given access to the code to even look at! i asked him if he didn't find it suspicious that he would hire someone, go on a large vacation, then come back and fire them. i said "how many assistant it persons has companyname gone through and how many more will companyname go through before they realize that the person they are looking for does not exist and start to insist that pa teach the new hire the ropes? it was right after this that pa was told that no new hires would be accepted and that new coding would have to be done out of house - aka hire contract programmers. none in the area wanted to touch the project so they ended up hiring a team from india. pa possibly because he lacked interpersonal skills got so frustrated having to explain what code he wanted was supposed to do finally quit with the statement "i'm tired of all the bs". he now works as a programmer elsewhere but thankfully he is not supervising anyone else. ps: in case the revenge was missed ... he ended up with a job that had less prestige, less pay, no underlings to abuse like he did others. it was a job that they frequently offered to college students for $10-12.50 an hour. i don't know what he got before but i know it was good enough for him to take a month vacation in vietnam. it caused him difficulty, it made me feel somewhat better and somewhat vindicated and a hell of a lot better to know he would not be able to mistreat another person. tldr: manager refuses to manage and train ends up frustrated into quitting after i point out his lack of performance to the owner after i was let go.i was in a relationship with this guy for 2 years, we were happy, i had introduced him to all my family including my son. then i found out that i was one of 2 women he was in a relationship with. i found this out by the first woman contacting me and then the whole story came to light. well once i found this out i decided i needed my revenge. i knew that this guy was driving without insurance or tax on his car, so i decided to make an anonymous tip off to crime stoppers (british service to dob in people who commit crime). i didn't think much of it until i got a call from the other woman who asked me if i knew why his car was clamped outside her house. i said i did not know. it just so happens that on that morning he had stayed over night at her house and when she left for work she took his mobile phone, the house phone and her keyboard with her so she could peruse his phone at her leisure at work, without him being able to tell people he didn't have his phone etc. obviously because she still didn't trust him. well it turns out that the police decided to clamp his car that day and with him unable to get in touch with anyone he had around a 3 hour walk to his mums house so he could sort his car out. oh and by the way that morning the woman found out there was a third woman involved with him when she took his phone that day so justice served :)noise complaints are a common theme in r/prorevenge. i have a nice story to tell that falls in that vein for sure. this is an abbreviated version, just the high (or low) points of the story. my best friend (call her "t") and her husband (call him "c") have a sturdy, large brick outbuilding behind their family home that serves as her husbands c's practice area and recording studio. we can all get really loud in there without getting in trouble with the neighborhood or the cops. c's dad (call him "pops") is sort of one of those bleeding heart types. one day pops announces that c's brother will be moving back in and he goes out and divides the studio and puts a second door in so that the brother(we will call him "ds" for dipshit) has a place to live while he is once again looking for a job (ds can't hold a job cause he's an alcoholic). well after all this happens, needless to say when c is actually trying to do recording ds is blaring his shitty counrtry music. at one point ds has put the recording process 2 weeks behind, right before c and t were to go on vacation. after informing needed people what was going on and explaining the situation to them, they take off for vacation. after some discussion about what to do, a plan was hatched... 4- 18 inch folded horn subwoofers. after they had been gone for a day or so i had gone in to do some work myself and even though they were gone the noise continued. time to enact the plan, lined up the subwoofers in a nice "w" pattern wired them to the amps and set a tone generator for 10 hertz signal and turned it up just loud enopugh that you could vaguely feel the vibration in the outside wall but obviously couldn't here it. that kind of noise is maddening to say the least. it took 2 whole days to rus ds out of there and in the end we took out the door and knocked down the wall and got our happy and quiet studio back the way it was meant to be, country music free. don't blast your shitty music around people who have more power and equipment than you do cause you aren't going to win.growing up, our yard backed up to the back yard of the neighbors behind us, with a gate. they were a mormon family with 5 kids around our ages, and we were 'somewhat' friends with them so were always playing back and forth in each other's yards. one day, one of the girls invited my sister and i over to play, and to show off the new "swimming pool" her father had bought for them (it was one of those high sided hard plastic wading pools), and invited us to jump in. this continued for a couple days. coming over to play as usual a few days later, the kids told us that their father had told us we weren't allowed to play in the water, because (i swear i am not making this up) we were "gentiles" and therefore would "pollute" the water. my sister was about 8 years old, and i was about 6 at the time. we may have been young, but we knew enough to be really upset and hurt. and, once it was explained to us by our parents just *exactly* he meant by that, we were angry. really angry. a bit after this (maybe a week or two), we overheard the mother telling our mom that they would be gone for a week to go camping, and if she would keep an eye on the house (yep, too filthy to wade in a kiddie pool, but a great resource when they wanted something!). a plot of revenge was planned between my sister and i. waiting until the day after they'd left, we spent the morning drinking lemonade. copious amounts of lemonade. and then we waddled across the yards to their unsullied pool and proceeded to drain about two gallons of pee into the water. on the way back we also raided their large garden, filling up on anything ripe enough to eat. i cannot express the sense of satisfaction on hearing them gleefully splashing away the day they returned (and the next day, and the next), unwittingly baptizing themselves in the bodily fluids of their dirty, atheist neighbors. bonus: we overheard the mom complaining to our mom about how they were having to buy chicken wire for the garden to keep the animals out because they had lost so many vegetables! a summer my sister and i will remember fondly for the rest of our lives. my boss was the meanest, and just like nastiest woman i have ever met. she was a terrible boss and was mean to every woman in the office (she was really nice to the males though). she'd make comments about our appearance, our work and things that were irrelevant to our jobs. she really knew how to hit below the belt. she told me that i should focus on my career instead of a relationship because i wasn't the type of girl "guys could ever commit to", called a girl going on maternity leave 'lazy'. she told another girl that her heels were way too high and this wasn't a 'whore house'. she once even told me an assignment that i had worked really hard for and she had promised me "i'm just going to let chris and matt do it, because i don't think a girl could handle it" (lots of travel and negotiating involved) like a day before i was supposed to get started. meanwhile she was continuously complementing the guys. saying things like "its so nice to have an office full of real men" and "you guys can handle anything, i wouldn't be anywhere without my team of boys". she was totally out of hand and inappropriate, even they guys had noticed that her behavior was strange. anyway, one night i spot her pretty drunk at some random bar flirting with every guy and was just really really sloppy overall. then i saw her take off her wedding and try and slip it into her pocket, but because she was so drunk, she hadn't realized she had dropped it on the ground. i quickly pick it up and pocket it myself. at first i thought my revenge was to let her freak out about it for a little bit and then give it back to her later. but then she started making out with this random guy at the bar and i came up with a much better plan. i as slyly as possible snapped a picture of her and the guy (made sure to obscure his face--while making sure it was clearly her). anyway, i kept the ring and took a picture with the ring on the pinky of my male friend's hand. the following monday i sent a pictures to her husband with a short note that "i fucked your wife and she loved it so much she let me keep her ring". i sort of realized its not all plausible that she would give someone her wedding ring...but i just ran with it. i kind hoped that the ridiculousness of the letter would be overshadowed by her husbands rage. i ended up anonymously returning the ring as well (it was clearly expensive and i felt too guilty keeping it) and quitting a few days later as well. i never got a full follow up on the effects of my actions, but i do know her and her husband separated after that from one of my old coworkers. edit: my grammar was pretty bad, sorry! so this was years ago. i think i was maybeee 12 years old. this particular summer camp that i had been going to for a couple years had all their kids split up. boys and girls in their own camps and then different age groups had their own teepees lead by their team leaders who were usually high school aged kids. this year i was in the 3rd oldest group, which happened to be the most populated group. there was always a bit of competition between the boys teams. this year things were getting heated. the "big kids" we're beating us in almost every thing. paintball, obstacle courses, hogging the zip line and floating dock at the pond. some of these things they got trophies for and other rewards like smores or candy. the betrayal. one day while me and my buddy were catching frogs out of a pond, we heard some girls screaming and running out of their bathroom nearby. we run over to them to see what's happening. apparently there was a rattlesnake that had slithered its way into one of the stalls. so my buddy and i decide "hell yeah! we'll take care it!" be the heroes for the ladies. so we pick up some long branches and rocks and start trying to kill the thing. well in the loud commotion from the screaming girls, a few of the "big kids" came over and watched as my friend and i battled the elusive serpent. a few minutes later were coming out of the bathroom with our slain beast, the big kids ganged up on us and took the rattlesnake for their own and showed it off to the rest of the camp as their trophy. they got extra smores that night(an exclusive reward pretty much), forest cred, and made a trophy type thing with the snakes rattler tail. we.were.furious. this was the last straw. the gathering of the clans. the next evening at the chow hall my friend and i informed the rest of our teepee what had really happened with the snake incident. we all decided something has to be done. we wouldn't let the big kids push us around any more. one of our teepee brothers was working in the kitchen that evening so when no one was looking he opened the back door to let us in the supply closet. my friend and i wrote on a few of the napkins "secret meeting tonight, blue teepee, after chow". once we finished writing down our message we went around while plates and things were being passed out and slipped the napkins to each of the teepee leaders of the younger groups. about 8 o clock, after dinner chow was over and the two older groups had gone left for a night hike, all the younger teepees had met up by ours. we told them all about the snake thing, how they had stolen it from us and claimed all the prizes and glory for their own. with this, on top of all the other crap we had to put up with from the big kids we were all on the same page with getting revenge. our teepee leaders came up with our revenge plan. when i think back on it now, it was pure genius sun tzu style planning. operation moonbeam every year there was an unofficial pillow fight that happens between the teepees. it's a winner takes all death match. any candy/smores/extra goodies were taken as prize for the winning teams and with it usually being the last big competition that happened for the summer, it was very important to win as your teepee would go down in pillow fight history. while the big kids were still gone on their hike, and the sun slipping away behind the distant mountains, our team leaders had all us kids collect our moonbeams(flashlights) as many socks as we could find, and our pillows. once we had all regrouped they began to lay out the plan. our long socks were rolled up in to balls and filled into our pillow cases. doing so ensured "maximum damage" to our opponents. next we had one of our fastest kids dressed up in all camouflage go scout out the path where the big kids would be returning from. he would walkie talkie back to us when he saw them coming and sprint back to join us. from there, the rest of us would be hiding on the hill sides that surrounded the teepees with our flashlights and pillows ready. once the big kids returned in the dark of night they would be lured into the center of the grounds by our runner who would now be carrying the big kids teepee flag. then we attack. battle of eversmores the sun had retreated completely from view and the stars rose high into the sky, shining even brighter as if excited for the battle to come. we got the radio call from our scout and everyone ran to their places. scout was now sitting in front of the enemies teepee twirling the flag around when we saw their group marching back to camp. upon seeing the little kid in possession of their flag they all started yelling and gave chase, exactly as we had hoped. in the center of the grounds was a portapotty (luckily not one that can be tipped over) that our scout ran into as protection from the big kids. he was now surrounded by both groups of big kids kicking and yelling for him to come out and get a beating. with them all distracted the battle was ready to begin. on the hills all around the camp a few dozen flashlights beamed on blinding all the big kids in the center while battle cries rang and children charged from the hills with blood in their eyes and cotton polyester in their hands. a fire had been lit earlier to make the surrounding woods seem darker in contrast. i wish i could have seen what it looked like from their point of view, i'm sure it was glorious and terrifying all the same. within a matter a minutes many of the big kids had already surrendered after taking a beating. bodies lit with the orange glowing light of fire and war, dropping all around us in the chaos and confusion. some ran back to their teepees to find we had tied some of them together rendering the pillows useless. it was a good fight. not to say we didn't lose a few good men. the big kids resorted to pinecones in the few pillows they were able to salvage. but alas, we eventually won the fight and raided their teepee of all their hershey chocolate, marshmallows, and gram crackers. the rest of the night was spent around the camp fire, all us kids enjoying some well earned smores while the big kids had received our kitchen cleaning duties. as delicious a revenge it was, i was most happy about retrieving my rattle snake tail. blue teepee for life! yeah, we *all* know the ex-lax revenge to the point where it is a cliche..but let's be honest. it works. first off, keep in mind that this would legally count as "battery"..just putting that out there. typical story. years ago i worked in the admin dept. of a large university. our department handled security and parking operations. we had a shared breakroom, as most offices do. also in typical fashion, people began to notice that their lunches went missing..and if they did not go completely missing, they noticed portions of it had been consumed..which is even more gross. complaints followed, but the perp was never identified and the lunch theft continued. someone (and no, it was *not* me) decided to take matters into their own hands. the woman who did it owned up to me and gave me the details. she made something nice and delicious using a combination of chocolate and of course, chocolate ex-lax: brownines. she put it in the fridge with a note along the lines of "shelly's desert, please don't touch". come lunch time, it was missing of course. around 2pm she observed one of the parking enforcement officers, a complete moron and loser that nobody liked anyhow, making a beeline for the men's room. he then asked to leave because, by his own graphic admission, had a bad case of "the shits". now, i don't know the rest of the details other than the fact that "shelly" confronted the guy, and after that, no more lunches were stolen. i was in an abusive relationship for two years. i do not have any type of support from family and my friends cut me off because i did not leave him right after he hit me in the face. i was so stupid for not leaving right away. two years had passed, i finally able to believe in myself again and able to find a steady full time job. i slowly drift away from me and started to make new friends again. i slowly drift away and he started cheating on me. while he was in the bathroom, he forgot to lock his iphone and i saw their messages to each other. i decided to seek revenge instead of confronting him and then day came when i got my revenge , i met up with him in his place so we had some drinks and fortunately he got so drunk that he passed out. with my rubber gloves , i went to his laptop and went to his facebook so i posted tons of pornographic items. i wrote something in his facebook status too stating he is gay and he is sleeping with buddy and that he cannot hide his feelings for him anymore. on top of that when i was about to leave i saw a big jar full of weed, so i flushed it in the toilet. i am not homophobic but he is.*** and i do not smoke weed. so that was the last day i saw him. he freaked out on me and he mentioned as to why i threw his weed and i told him to call the police on me (as if) as for the other woman, fortunately she works at the women's centre where i went for counselling and she mentioned it to my ex and she also gave him my new address. i received a message from my ex and told me he will come see me at my new address so i decided to stay at a hotel. the week after i showed the text message to my counsellor and they terminated that woman and she got charged.setting: a quiet saturday afternoon, lot's of rain, boredom. i was sitting in my room when the doorbell rang. not a rare occurrence by any means, but it was what happened after that was really interesting. my dad opened the door and i peaked out from the banister above the door to see who had come. a man greets my father, asks him if we're selling the car out front. turns out, even though it doesn't say we are, we have been thinking about it for quite some time. the man gives us this sob story about his landscaping business and his pregnant wife and how he really needs this a car. it seems legit, and my initial sketchiness dies down a little. he offers my dad $2k for a truck with 130,000 miles on it. not a horrible offer, so my mom begins the required paperwork to hand over the title and make a bill of sale. she asks for his id and he hands it to her. this is where it gets really interesting. my mom was still somewhat sketched out about a random stranger asking to buy a random car in our driveway that isn't for sale. it was weird, not something that happens every day! and she was right. she looks up his name online and a massive slew of public documents and news stories about scammers buying high mileage cars and selling them for massive profit after turning back the odometer shows up! this man was convicted of a massive fraud ring less than two years ago, and is out on probation from federal prison. he's at it again! i will link the news stories and court public record if allowed (i know private information is frowned upon so i will post without it initially). **mods decided not to allow me to post this info. not sure if i agree since it is all public domain and what better revenge then to out these motherfuckers to the fullest? it is what it is i guess.** my mom tells me to go outside and help my dad bail on this deal. my dad was outside helping the guy look at the car (that shit wouldn't even start ffs), and i tell them that my friend has agreed to give us $3k for it instead and that we were no longer interested. he gives me the lip and i basically tell him to fuck off (subtly, i think they know what's up at this point and i told my dad secretly what was up). i'm a big guy, so the intimidation factor may have been enough to scare them off. my dad and i walk back inside, thinking it's over. it's not over. my mom wrote down the man's state id number, and his address. after contacting the local authorities, they told us to contact the attorney general's office and we've taken it upon ourselves to contact the local news station that ran the stories about him! updates in the near future are sure to follow! this is my first post, so be kind. i've just been reading all of your revenge stories so i just had to contribute my own. :) as far as being bullied goes, middle school is the worst time to be a kid regardless of your color, creed, etc. it's a time when everyone is just starting puberty and all of this fear and confusion turns kids into cruel and soulless beings. so, imagine how much more confusing and traumatic it is to be a middle schooler when you are gay, and when the most popular insult that get's thrown around in the school yard is "faggot". anyway, i was realizing around then that i was a lesbian. i'd never been popular but always had more guy-friends than girl-friends so my best friend was this kind of slovenly, overweight, mouth-breathing boy whom i shall refer to as piggy. i made the mistake of telling piggy that i thought i was attracted to girls and he spread it all around the school as fast as his little piggy legs could carry him. even though no one had known who i was prior to my outing, they sure as hell knew who i was then and never forgot to shout abuse at me when i walked by in the lunch room. in p.e. i wound up having to change in the bathroom to spare myself humiliation since all of the other girls avoided me like plauge and were always making loud comments to one and other about how they felt like i was watching them when they changed. piggy was one of the people who tormented me the most, and it hurt the most coming from him since we'd been so tight in elementary school. yeah, it was a fun three years. anyway, come high school i thankfully made some new friends after finding my niche in band and people seemed to grow out of name calling to an extent. piggy also wound up going to the same high school (as did most of our middle school class). piggy had a gorgeous sister, who i'll call lovely. lovely was a year younger than piggy was and was a freshman when i was a sophomore. lovely played the flute and we saw a lot of each other in band class as well as marching band. you see where this is going, eh? well, fast forward to my senior year and lovely and i have become very close friends. and by very close, i mean i took her to prom. and here's the kicker--- piggy didn't have anyone to take to prom. i picked lovely up from piggy's house and he was just standing there in a tux looking like a jerk allllll alone while the two of us drove away. also, you know how piggy was a homophobic prick in middle school? well, he stayed that way in high school and was constantly spewing his hateful shit on facebook (i only know this because lovely was his friend on facebook and if i wanted to i could see his stuff anyway since he had zero privacy settings). he didn't want to be associated with gays in any way. well, lovely and i took heaps of photos at prom together and tagged him in every one of our pictures (there were some where we were kissing each other on the cheek and stuff, nothing nasty!). he untagged himself, of course, but at least he got to know that somewhere out there people were looking at pictures of his own sister which proved that ---oh no!--- he was connected to a gay person! i wish we'd screen-shotted some of the passive-agressive and not so passive but all out aggressive facebook posts he made afterwards. it's really rough trying to play nice when you've been victimized in some way. and sometimes being mean is actually kind of awesome (as this wonderful place has shown me). but, in many cases revenge just isn't an option, and it feels pretty good to just survive and let your happiness be a big "f*ck you!" to the ones who tried to screw with you. as tempting as it is to consider asking lovely for piggy's email and signing him up for every gay-porn site imaginable, i don't feel that it is necessary now. i've won! lovely and i are still friends now, though i went out of state for college. piggy stayed home and went to community college, and last i heard is still driven to school by his mother. i think the best part of my revenge is the fact that it wasn't done deliberately at all... life just decided i'd had enough shit and gave me a karmic pat on the back while giving piggy a karmic kick in the behind. tl;dr: i was outed as a lesbian in middle school by my so-called best friend and wound up dating his sister in high school.this is my brother's revenge story. he was working for a software company in early 90's or so. this is when companies were writing all kinds of programs to see what would sell. there was a guy who was a friend of all the programmers there. we will call him jimbob. jimbob was allowed to use the software they were programming. as he was their bud and all. this had been going on for sometime. then they found out he was selling the software behind their backs. did they confront him? nope. did they stop lending him the software? big nope. in fact, they made sure he always got whatever new software they came up with. this went on for several months. where is the revenge, you ask? well....they included a little extra code with all the software they let him try. when he made copies and sold the software, the little extra code went with it. now this little bit of code was not included in the legal copies. what did the code do, you ask? oh nothing much. just wiped the hard-drive and put a bouncing pumpkin on the screen that laughed at you. and if you cleaned your hard-drive and reinstalled the software, it would automatically go off as the start date had passed. when did it go off, you ask? why on halloween of course. he called them the next day about it. their response "everybody who has a **legal** copy of our software is having no problems whatsoever." and that is when he realized he had been busted. he never asked for another piece of software from them ever again. picky, nosy neighbors who have the president of the local homeowner's association on speed-dial are a real nuisance... one day a few years ago, my faithful old volvo gave up the ghost... the automatic transmission was slowly going out; the final blow was when an oil line to an external oil filter developed a pinhole leak and the engine seized when all the oil escaped. i had the car towed home, and it sat in the driveway for a month or so while i tried to decide what to do with it - the options being to replace both the engine and transmission or sell it off cheap either for parts or to someone who wanted to get it running again. i finally, reluctantly, decided to let it go - i'd miss it, as it had been probably the best car i'd ever had, and i'd done some serious upgrades &amp; improvement to it. about this time, my neighbor called the hoa to complain that i had a "junk car" in the driveway that i was parting out; to hear her version, the president expected to see something on cinder blocks, with no doors, the hood up and no engine. the truth was that it was still intact, with current license plates and insurance - there was no way to tell from looking at it that it wasn't running. nevertheless, i was given one week to either fix the car or have it gone. the busybody neighbor was known for being extremely conservative - she made tea-baggers seem middle-of-the-road!!! one of the things which she had a particular dislike for was the local npr radio station, which was associated with a local university... the station was running a fund-raiser at the time, so i decided to kill two birds with one stone - i donated the car to the radio station. the appointed saturday came around, and the car was being picked up by a tow truck when she came out to watch the proceedings with a smug look. she commented to me that it was about time that "piece of junk" was being removed; when i replied that i'd donated it to the local npr station, her smug look was instantly replaced by horror, quickly followed by livid anger. she stalked back into her house and slammed the door; i was happy that even to the last, my trusty volvo had been useful. (edit: spelling)**payback is a bitch for abortion clinic protestors, thanks to a brilliant landlord** todd stave has the unenviable position of being the landlord of a building in germantown, maryland, which he leases to an abortion provider called reproductive health services clinic. so he knows a little something about dealing patiently with anti-abortion protesters. but when they started calling him at home at all hours and harassing his family, he got fed up and came up with a very clever solution: do unto others as they have been doing unto you. problems really began for stave at the end of 2010, when he leased his building to leroy carhart, one of the only doctors in the u.s. who openly acknowledges that he performs late-term abortions. as you can imagine, he's a controversial man, and protesters come from far and wide. there is a constant group of them parked outside, praying and holding up signs, many of which have pictures of mangled fetuses. that's pretty much a landlord's nightmare, and yet stave has a very calm attitude about it. he told petula dvorak of the washington post this week, it's their right. they are protected by the first amendment. and outside the clinic is probably the most appropriate place for them to express their views. if you're wondering how stave can remain so relaxed about the situation, he explains, "i've been a member of this fight since roe v. wade. since i was 5 years old." you see, the clinic used to belong to his father, and then his sister ran it. when he was younger, the office was firebombed, and protesters were often gathered outside his dad's house. so he's used to a certain level of harassment and he'll tolerate it — but only up to a point. and recently, the usually calm, cool, and collected stave was pushed to his limit. it's common practice for anti-abortion protesters to disseminate doctors' personal information and urge people to harass them—and it can clearly go far beyond that, as with the 2009 murder of dr. george tiller in kansas. leroy carhart, who's now in stave's clinic, had his nebraska farm burned to the ground back in 1991. but protesters in maryland figured out they could start targeting stave for owning the clinic's property. he was largely unfazed by this campaign, until last fall when they took it too far. on his daughter's first day in middle school, a large group of people protested outside her school, and then they showed up again for back-to-school night. they were naturally carrying signs with his name and contact info and those nasty pictures of fetuses. stave was furious, and then it got even worse. dozens of the protestors began calling him at home, around the clock. his friends wanted to help him fight back; that's when stave had the brilliant idea of turning the tables on his tormentors. he began recording the names and numbers of the assholes who called, and then he gave the list of info to his friends and asked them to call these people back on his behalf. shazam! and the really smart part was that when someone from team stave called, they always took the high road. he explains, in a very calm, very respectful voice, they said that the stave family thanks you for your prayers. they cannot terminate the lease, and they do not want to. they support women's rights. genius. while it was initially only a few friends doing the calling, the group quickly expanded. soon, he was up to having 1,000 callers at his disposal. and they got crafty too. they'd look up information on the people who'd placed unwanted calls to stave, and then when they called, they'd drop the names of the person's children or their school into the conversation. they'd also, said stave, "tell them that we bless their home on such and such street," and then name their address. are you getting shivers up you're spine yet? stave's calling force became so powerful that sometimes he was able to hammer an unwanted caller with up to 5,000 calls in return. looks like two can play at this game, stalkers. stave's approach was so appealing that he was flooded with people from all over wanting to help. so he organized voice of choice, which now has about 3,000 volunteers. they don't just fight back for stave anymore. they'll make calls on behalf of whoever is being bullied by anti-abortion protesters, whether it's a doctor or a landlord or their family. when asked if he thought this method of payback was harsh, stave said no: "we gave them back what they gave us." actually, not even. you gave back a mild, family-friendly version of what they gave to you. you proved to them that you know where they live and who their children are, but you didn't show up at their homes and schools and threaten them. you didn't come onto their lawn with posters detailing terrible imaginary things that they've done. you're serving up revenge lite™: tastes great, less killing. what's more, stave is strict about who voice of choice will make calls for. if it's just run-of-the-mill protests outside clinics, he won't help them because he believes in people's first amendment right to be out there saying what's on their mind. protestors must be personally harassing doctors or landlords in order for stave to step in. if only abortion opponents had the same respect for people doing what they were allowed by law to do. ahem. so this is the part where the evil bullies who've plagued him (and others) at all hours of the day or night learn their lesson after having a taste of their own medicine, right? yep, yep. they all realized they were being horrible, and now every anti-abortion protester is treating their pro-choice opponents with the utmost respect. ha. no. actually this is the part in the story where it gets much worse. ready? since voice of choice has been such a success, stave was honored by naral in california last week. knowing that he was going to be out of town receiving the award, his personal band of haters chose that moment to canvass his neighborhood with fliers that had a photo of stave in a nazi uniform, photos of holocaust victims, and bloody fetuses. [pause for a brief rage-stroke intermission.] of course, the fliers had stave's contact information—and all of the phone numbers and addresses for other members of his family. this goes without saying but, nevertheless: this is so incredibly fucked up. first of all, the guy owns a building, not a concentration camp. second of all, what kind of person picks up a flier like that and thinks, "i need to get in touch with this nazi!" god help us all. obviously stave's daughter and all of his neighbors saw the fliers, but the contact information for stave's family members must have been spread around. because on monday an abortion protestor showed up at the dental office owned by stave's brother-in-law and began doing his abortion-protestor routine outside. that's such a great idea — i'm sure the random patient walking in for a cleaning is totally going to make the connection that the dentist's brother-in-law owns a building where there's an abortion clinic, and therefore abortion is wrong. at this point, stave was back in town, so he went over to confront the protestor. and when he got there, the creep said, "how was your trip to san francisco?" deep inhale, slow exhale. it is amazing that people like stave have fortitude to stand up to psychos like this coming at them from every direction, but thank heavens they do, because, honestly, the thought that these protesters get away with so much is sickening. it's hard to know where these nutcases will end when it comes to making stave's life a living hell—but it's probably not going to get any better now that he's getting more and more national media attention. at least we know he's got plenty of backup from voice of choice. the worse these people get, the longer voc can keep them on the phone, telling them all about the many "blessings and prayers" they're sending to their home addresses and to the locations of their children's daycare centers. then everyone will be so busy making and receiving calls that they'll have less time to spend protesting outside clinics. and maybe in the future, we'll get to a magical place where both sides are talking to each other 100 percent of the time, and a woman will be able to walk right up to the front door of an abortion clinic without being harassed—because everyone will be so busy talking on the phone to their enemies to notice or care what she's choosing to do with her body. edit: added attribution linki was the drummer in my friend's band. some friend of his wound up becoming the bass player, with one annoying habit. he was constantly late for practice and gigs and on a personal level was known to be a no show. so, friend and i have dealt with his problem for almost two years, but like idiots, we agree to let him pick us up at a mall after another friend dropped us there. i know. we wind up stranded there until mall security throws us out at 10, walk to a denny's in the snow and finally get someone on the phone (this is pre-cell days) who is willing to come out in bad weather and let us stay at their place until we can get home the next day. we ask the bass player for a reason why he stranded us in the middle of the night. he gives us some lie which we later deduce to be that he simply found something better to do with someone with drugs and now mf'er it is game the eff on. he moves to a trailer in ashland, oh (an hour drive south of us). invites us down to ashland to spend the evening, go bowling, drink, be drunk and stupid and meet farm country girls courtesy of his fiance. okay. we load a cooler with beer, we bring sleeping bags, we prepare as young men expecting to bang farm girls might. two hours in the gravel parking lot of his shitty trailer park; we have had beers and cooked on my mini-weber and cursed this worthless pos far into the evening. just before dark, we decide to invade his trailer. we pop out a screen on the lowest window, i shimmy up and inside, open the door and let my friend in. we moved all his furniture. we removed all books from shelves and piled them in closets, we removed all light bulbs from everything and placed them in a bag in the freezer (that way when he found them and put them in, the filament would blow unless he warmed them up). we ransacked the place but didn't destroy anything. loved what my friend wrote on his living room mirror in gf lipstick, i think it was "witness this!" in reference to his upbringing as a jw. we piled all the big furniture against the only entry door (which open out, unfortunately), jammed a bookcase and a chair against the low window we used to get in, and then dropped out of the window furthest from the ground. considered camping until he got home to see the reaction, but who knew when and if this clown would ever show up. next band practice, he shows up on time and heads straight for me and starts screaming in my face about breaking in to his trailer and fucking up his shit and his gf was crying in the parking lot and how dare we, blah, blah, blah. my friend comes over and asks, completely cool, what is going on? he tells us that he came home the next morning and at that point my friend just loses it, tells him he deserved it and i lose it except i'm laughing thinking about this idiot boosting himself into the window of the trailer and tripping trying to find his way around and find his light bulbs that are all going "plink" in freezer death because they're too cold to light. not the greatest prank of my life, but still the one that makes me chuckle the hardest. tl;dr friend and i ransacked the trailer of an undependable friend, about 15 years ago when i was about 14 i went on a church trip to centrifuge in arizona or new mexico...some arid god-awful state. (sorry if you live there, i'm from mississippi so, can't judge, right?) for those not in the know, centrifuge is a massive, once a year meetup for evangelical christians. anyway, my dad is coming along as a chaperone. he's on the bus, and i'm just getting on. someone bumps into the back of me, i sprawl forward and bump into the guy in front of me. he gets mad, grabs me by the collar, and throws me at the wall of the bus. i was picked on a lot. i had no social skills, and i put up with the abuse just to be around people who were popular. as far as my dad was concerned, these shits had threatened his son. this, as i would later learn, was strike one. later on the bus, they shot spit balls at my dad. this would be strike two. so we arrive in new mexico and immediately start exploring this...compound? it was huge numbers of dorms, a miniputt course, conference rooms, etc. the perfect place for this big, once a year christian meetup. turns out, the desert gets cold as well as hot. we had all packed for summer, but it was rainy and cold as hell. my dad, prudent man that he is, picked up a pair of sweats for me and him. he also gave me an early birthday present: the 4th harry potter book. so i get all comfy in my sleeping bag and start reading. everyone else stays out until they are super tired and crash. few had the energy to make their bunk beds livable, so they froze. now, before everyone got to sleep, a chaperone announced he knew that the older kids had shaving cream, and they should give it up and not use it to cream their fellow campers. a few sample size cans were given up. the next morning, i wake up covered in shampoo. these assholes had put shaving cream everywhere, along with shampoo on all my clothes. they even emptied out toothpaste onto my stuff. that night i slept cold because my sleeping bag was ruined. strike 3. now centrifuge is very rigidly structured. the whole day is running around learning about jesus, with 1 hour freetime at night before lights out. well my dad was lagging behind that morning... after everybody left for morning worship, my dad stayed behind. he went into the older kids' room (the ones largely responsble) and poured their shampoo, toothpaste, and shaving cream all over their mattresses. pillows? shampooed bedding? toothpaste. those little hand-sewn anagrammed pillows? creamed so then my dad just goes to church worship with the rest of us. we all return, and holy hell are they mad! you know what? it was probably those texas boys upstairs! there was almost a fight between us mississippians defending the honor of our bedding, and the flummoxed texas boys who had no idea wtf was going on but sure as shit weren't going to have their honor insulted either. lex luthor, i.e. my dad, smiled. he later told me he was disappointed that the fight never happened, and hoped the texas boys whupped their ass. finally, one of the chaperons who knew my dad was late that morning asked him if he did it. he said he did. they started yelling at him. i went outside and caught the tail end of the conversation. they told my dad i should stand up for myself (against a legion of older kids). my dad just said "i thought he needed a little divine intervention." and that's why my dad is kickass. edit: this is my first post, if its pettyrevenge, my bad. i didn't know. anagrammed pillows man, srs business. edit: there's a lot of debate about this being pro or not. this was my first post and first time *in* this subreddit. i already copied it to petty revenge. the only reason i haven't taken it off *here* is because it's clear a large enough audience enjoyed the story. you're free to down/upvote all you want, but please stop arguing amongst yourselves. thank you. i want to start off saying i gave up on revenge long ago and adopted the "don't wish bad on others, wish good on yourself" philosophy as if your wish comes true, one benefits you while the other's worthless. that being said, here's one of my last acts of revenge from freshman year of college 10 years ago. my dorm was a 3 story brownstone. i lived in a double on the first floor and had a quad and triple of freshman above me. i admittedly was a little intense my first semester of college, but i always tried to make friends rather than problems. for whatever reason, all the other freshman in the dorm started to shun and exclude me except my roommate. it was really lonely and i felt really unwanted and fucking insecure all the time. it got to the point they didn't talk to me or go near my room if i was there. march of that year, i went home for a weekend. when i came back, i found my cookie crisp was gone (i bought cereal for breakfast as it wasn't included in my meal plan. it was all i had in the morning) and my tissue box was empty (that still creeps me the fuck out). my roommate told me it was the freshman who shunned me. i calmly went to ask about it and ask why and they immediately put on angry faces, told me to calm down and they would replace it that night. well, hours pass and they didn't leave. the school store was closing soon so i went up stairs and politely asked jimmy (the guy the douches all followed) if he could please go soon so i would have breakfast in the morning. he grumbles and says ok. another hour passes and the stores close to closing, nobody went. i politely ask again and jimmy says "i'm not going and i'm not going to let you *harass* me into it." "well, that's nice, but that's not the decision you made when you ate my breakfast." "what do you mean breakfast? what time you wake up? what time is your class? why don't you eat in the cafeteria? " "none of these questions matter, you ate it, you replace it." he stomps off into his room. at this point, i stop being forgiving and know what to do "ok, jimmy...i'm gonna take a shower." the douchebag left all his toiletries in the bathroom, which was a small one toilet one bathtub bathroom for 9 college dude. i got in for my shower and proceeded to piss in his yellow shampoo and then as quickly as i could move, jizz in his -conditioner -on his hand soap and face bar -in his toothpaste it was hard to make sure i got it everywhere and no clear signs of it, but i got it to work. i didn't tell a soul for a year, and i don't think i told anyone about the toothpaste for a little longer. i didn't care if he mouthed off to me afterwards. i already ruined it for him. tldr: mufugga stole my cookie crisp so i jizzed in his toothpaste. **the background** so this is back around '90. i grew up in a pretty cool neighborhood, but we had that one house. you know, the one with the elderly couple with not a god damn thing to do. they did all the typical, "stay off my lawn!" bs. where i felt they took it to a new level however, is when my friends and i were playing ball, they would wait in the garage. one would peek through the window and the other had their hand on the button. so, as soon as a ball started rolling in the direction of their house, the door starts opening and here comes oldster to steal it. it got to the point that one of my buddies sprinted over there and kicked the ball away as the guy was bent over to pick it up. he didn't like that. tried to accuse everyone of assault. he also called the police each time he stole one of our balls. this despite them repeatedly telling him that a ball rolling over your lawn is not trespassing, but taking it is stealing. **the incident** up until now, they were annoying, but not much else. at the time, i had the most awesome dog, tiger. he was a stray that came to live with us a few years earlier, but he still liked to wander a lot too. just as dogs are want to do, and at the time, letting your dog out was still common. well, my neighbor would call the dog warden every day. not because he was shitting or pissing or digging up his lawn, because he walked through it. that's it. so, eventually it comes down to we need to fence in the dog or lose him. we build a fence all the way around the property, just so tiger can houdini his way out again and again. he was a super cool freakin' ninja dog. long story short, he kept finding new ways to get out, because that's how he wanted to live, and it resulted in us loosing him for good. i was apoplectic, i genuinely wanted to murder the old bastards. i eventually came to my senses and resolved to ruin what he loved instead. **the revenge** they absolutely worshiped their stupid grass. he cut it 3-4 times per week, watered it daily. you will think i am joking, but i am in the n.e. of the u.s. and he had a second snow blower that he set up to get the snow off the lawn with out tearing out the grass. ridiculous. costco was new at the time, and my dad didn't pay much attention to the stuff we threw into the cart. so that is how i came to be in possession of 40 lbs. of salt. we were leaving for a week at the shore the next morning, so about 3 am i was spreading salt. it took a few days to kill the grass, so i was a few hundred miles away when ***"asshole"*** appeared in 5 foot tall letters, extremely visible from the street. by the time i got back, he had re-sodded the whole thing. luckily, friends had taken pictures of the lawn and themselves giving thumbs up from the sidewalk. i can still picture old man n watching that photoshoot through the garage window. in my mind, it is akin to [hector salamanca]( with lots of lip quivering, impotent rage, and spittle. **edit** love how much discussion something i did 20+ years ago when i was 14-15 can create. to clarify, the dog did not run away. he was "sent to live on a farm" a.k.a. put down. this is the only dog i didn't raise from a pup. as i said, tiger was a street dog that took us in more than we took him in. picture 'tramp' from the disney movie. we were lucky enough that he liked hanging out with us. i do train any animal that i am keeping as a pet. this dog had his own separate identity above and beyond that. that is why he was so awesome. he didn't need us, he was with us because he wanted to be. **edit 2** how has nobody even referenced using a snow blower on the lawn yet? i thought that was the craziest part of the story! i am 100% serious that he would spend an insane amount of time every snowstorm clearing off what was about a 40' x 60' front lawn. i was in class a few years ago, and the little shit behind me was poking and kicking my seat, i was fairly quiet in class, he was not. so i turned around while everyone was taking notes and the teacher was writing on the board, picked up his text book, threw it across the room and it slammed off the floor. i quickly went back to writing before the book hit the ground. so there he was, no book and no one buying his story about me doing it and he gets sent to the principal's office.back in college i met a girl through my classes, we became fwb. she would often come over to my apartment to work on stuff together. a couple months later, found out she was bad mouthing me to my roommate who she was trying to hook up with. i ended up breaking things off with her, but kept her added on facebook. i find out that she is getting an engaged to another indian guy (she was indian herself). i ended up adding her fiance. started talking to him, turns out he was under the assumption his precious fiance was a virgin. i told him that i had sex with her, he asked her she completely denied it and he ended up deleting me afterwards. turns out my roommate who bad mouthed me still had naked pictures of her, i ended up sending them through a fake facebook account to him. found out a bit later that they ended breaking up. i don't know, i actually feel good about it. told a few of my friends, all my female friends said i was an asshole, while my guy friends think i did the right thing. now i know many people might not agree with indian culture, about virginity and all and that’s perfectly fine. but to this guy it meant a good bit, he saved himself for marriage and expected his wife to had done the same. you can say when she was younger she experimented and all but if that is the case she should have told him and let him judge whether he wanted to stay or not. instead she lied to him and wanted to marry him under false pretenses. i know i wasn't doing it out of a good heart. but that being said, can we say that i did the right thing for the wrong reason? if you were the guy wouldn't you want to know? **call me an asshole but if she gets engaged to another *traditional indian guy*, i will definitely tell him too.** **edit** for those of you saying that indian culture is so repressive and misogynistic. am i not doing her a favor saving her from such a "chauvinistic culture." if she has to lie about her virginity to a guy, because he won't accept her otherwise is it *true love*? i am saving her from a life time with a guy that doesn't value her. that way she can find a more sex positive guy! so, here's the deal: i go to school at wvu. i'm a medical student and i live in a building that is 10 minutes from the hospital. it's a nice building and every apartment has (at least) a full bedroom and a living room. each floor has a boys bathroom and a girls bathroom, and each consists of a number of stalls, along with 5 or 6 showers. due to policy, and at the request of other occupants, the building's only cameras are out front and in the back. lately, there's been this guy going around and taking shits in the showers. the first time it happened, it was on the second floor (i live on the fifth). a student walked in early in the morning before class and said that it was right over the drain. personally, i found this to be incredibly funny and thought nothing of it, assuming it was a one-time prank. the following tuesday, on the sixth floor, it happened again. needless to say, us students didn't find it as funny this time around. from this point on, everybody was extremely cautious when stepping into the showers. on thursday, it happened once more. this time was different, though. it happened on my floor. to be more specific, it happened to me when i stepped into the shower. i was not lucky enough to see it before i stepped in it. this was becoming personal. i was so pissed that i even called the staff to complain. they said that since we didn't know who it was, and due to the no-camera policy, they couldn't do anything about it at the time. i then took it upon myself to find a solution. i spent the next week planning my revenge. throughout this week, the shower-shit had become more frequent. it happened almost every day. i figured it had to be someone in the building, because according to the building staff, no one had been coming in-and-out every day who was not a resident. eventually, i had narrowed it down to two revenge plans: 1. wait it out, let somebody else handle it, then extract my revenge later on whoever did this. the problem with this plan was that whoever did it was sure to be expelled/suspended. at least kicked out of the building. i wanted to either be the cause of this or make this awful person suffer more. 2. i was going to find out who the midnight shitter was, and turn him in, after i had executed whatever i was going to do to this monster. i decided to go with option 2, and the problem now was how to find out how to catch the person. i could try a camera, but that would be an invasion of both building policy, and the law. you cannot but a camera in a bathroom. the other option was to gather several of other occupants (who i knew could not be the shitter) and stand guard outside the bathrooms. once again, i went with option two. me and twelve residents stood outside the bathrooms on each floor, and pretended to be texting. there were six floors and we each took shifts throughout the night. whoever was the shitter must have heard of our plans, because nothing had happened for the first two nights of doing this. on the third night, however, my luck skyrocketed. i saw a student go into the bathroom i was watching. he was on my floor, but i didn't talk to him. he was new, and he had recently transferred from uga. he walked in and i waited. no shower sounds, no toilet flushing. i peeked into the bathroom, slightly, and looked. no one was in the stall. i then slowly scoped the outside of the showers until i saw a small shadow inside the last one. i had finally found this man. since he was on my floor, i knew all about the guy. we will call him jim. jim was a man of indian decent. he had several friends who i knew of, and both were in classes with me. the next monday, i approached one of them. i explained my whole situation, and we hatched a plan together. the plan was that this friend was going to spend the night at jim's place, then let me in when jim was asleep. i was then going to enter with 3 bags of cow manure and pour them all over the apartment. then, in the morning, i was going to report him to the proper authorities. surprisingly enough, my whole plan worked, and he was evicted from the building. **tl;dr: this guy at my college shits in all the showers, so me and another guy put cow manure in his apartment then report him.**ok, so here's the thing. when i moved to australia, about 9 years ago, i was 9 (now 18) and had no friends. this was understandable, but the sad part was that no-one wanted to be my friend. i did everything wrong, i sat with the wrong posture, i said the wrong thing, i acted like a 5 year old when something serious was going on, i acted like a 20 year old when some game was happening, every little thing just went wrong for me. then, this amazing person became my friend. i'll call her sophie coldfish, to protect her identity, because that would be going a little far. anyway, sophie was my first real friend here, and i met her after easily 3 years with literally not a single friend in the hemisphere. we did pretty much everything together, and later she introduced me to her own friends, and we very quickly bonded. now, this was fine for about 2 years. i had a great best friend, who was warm and friendly to me, and i had a great group of new friends who were interested in science fiction and classic literature and all the other nerdy things i liked. and then i got my diagnosis of autism. this wasn't something i bandied about or anything, i kept this information close to my chest, telling only the people i thought i could trust most in the world. apparently this did not extend to my best friend, little miss coldfish. she went screaming about how i was a freak, a liar, a retard and a pervert (where did she get that one from? and yes, all of these and more were her actual words). it got so bad i tried to kill myself on three separate occasions. it turned out she had a serious problem with anyone she perceived as mentally ill, and held virtually neo-nazi views about what should be done with mentally disabled people. i vowed absolute, total revenge on this bitch who had ruined my carefully-constructed life. we ended up sparring a little, mostly verbally, until after about 6 months of this we just sort of lapsed into furious silence. she should have remembered that i was the winner of the prize for science in my school for 3 years running. after about 2 more months, i got really sick of her shit. i still had my old friends from before, but my former best friend was now my absolute nemesis. i trusted her with everything, and now she was using that against me, telling people i was bigender ("hey, did you know the nutjob is a faggot too?"), that i had tourette's ("yeah, like that retard on youtube") and that i liked star trek and old sci-fi movies and things ("what a fucking nerdy bitch"). i found my way onto ebay, and bought 8 ounces of 99% pure iodine crystals. i then went to the local shops, and got some disposable pitchers and a few bottles of ammonium. if you mix these up in a certain ratio, you get a highly volatile chemical called nitrogen triiodide. this is also known as explosive paint. later that night, i went to her house, and painted this stuff around her door handle. her door is one of the ones where if you turn the handle on one side, the other turns too. i also painted it under the wheels of her car, and under her welcome mat. since nitrogen triiodide will explode with a small amount of force and a terrifyingly loud bang when touched or moved, leaving an indelible yellow stain, this might be quite interesting. fast forward a little. i come back four days later. there's a deep yellow stain on the door handle, and on her driveway. two of her tyres have the same mark, two others look new (i later found out from a co-worker of hers that they burst "for some reason"). turning over her mat, there are deep yellow and black scorch-marks in it. i did this again, only this time on her bike wheels and under her window (which i heard from her boyfriend had been replaced, very expensively, since she thought she broke it because of the cracking sound), a week later. she'll never know it was me specifically, but i have a fair idea. she's stopped calling me names in the street, which is something, and i may even have the restraining order (200 metres) lifted if she keeps up this enforced good behaviour.this was a couple years back. the drummer of this band we shared our practice space with accused us of cutting him short on our portion of the rent, which we definitely hadn't. he emailed us saying we now owe two months rent and that he was friends with the building manager who could kick us out (he didn't). we told him we knew he was full of shit, to which he challenged us to a fight in the park, because that's what adults do. we decided it was sketchy to just leave our gear in that room where they could get to it, so we drove down that day to move it all out. we get there and there are two new padlocks on the door. bad move. we come back at 2am and cut the locks off with bolt cutters. we get in and grab our gear. i knew the drummer hides a bottle of 151 inside his kick drum through the front hole, so i get it out and proceed to top it off with a nice minute long piss that i'd been holding on the bart ride over and then put it back. i then overtightened all the bottom heads of his drums for good measure. finally, we installed a new door handle and locked it from the inside and three new padlocks on the outside. we heard, from a friend in a band in a spot down the hall, that it took their drunk asses two weeks to get their shit together enough to get back in there. i'm pretty sure he drank that piss rum too, because 151 smells much stronger and is much darker. there's no way he could've known. but we do. and now you do. and that's all that matters. after reading /u/sebbonl's tale of pwning a scumbag driver, it inspired me to tell you guys about a very similar tale that happened to myself and my so one afternoon a few months ago. my so is 23 with an open license but currently no car. he grew up working on cars with his dad and has had more car-related jobs from rentals to detailing to mechanics than i can count. he loves cars and knows more about them than anyone i've ever met. he has owned many cars and is a skilled but (mostly) responsible driver. he has a friend who is young and does not yet have a license, but had recently gotten a supposedly great deal on a kinda junky looking bmw (no idea what kind, i'm a chick and i don't know jack about cars) which he lent to my so for a few days to run errands, since without a license he can't drive it anyway. so my so comes over with the car one day after offering to take me to an appointment. when we go downstairs, we both have a laugh at it. it has a terrible, patchy paint job, a huge crappy wing hanging off it and those stupid rear window decals from car accessory manufacturers that losers think will make them go faster. it screams 'bogan street cred'. it's quite nice on the inside though, tan leather interior and everything, and my so tells me that his friend did in fact get a good deal as the car has low mileage and is in great working condition. i was also surprised to learn that it's zippy as fuck. on the way back from my appointment, we're cruising down the highway. there's about 6 lanes going in each direction and every few hundred metres or so there's a steel arch that goes over the road with digital led speed signs hanging down. iirc, the speed limit was set to 100kph which is normal considering it was a quiet afternoon with not a whole lot of cars on the road, and the only one near us was a dark blue sedan just ahead in the lane left of us. we're just chilling, listening to the radio with the windows down, when a white mid-to-late 90's holden commodore (aussies will see where this is going) passes us on the right. we don't notice them at this point but when they get about two car lengths ahead of us, we see arms protruding from the left side of the vehicle and motioning at the blue sedan. the blue car's windows are rolled down but nothing seems to be happening so the commodore moves into our lane to drive alongside them. an arm comes out of the holden's passenger side window waving an unopened can of [xxxx gold beer]( now, for non-aussies, xxxx gold and commodores are both huge bogan identifiers and go together like coloured mohawks and tartan pants go with punk kids. you see the two things together and can usually conclude with about 95% accuracy that the owner of those things is a bogan. anyway, at this point it has become clear that the blue sedan is carrying a number of women, and the guy in the holden's passenger seat is *offering the lady driver a beer*. thankfully, it's not working. the women merge into the lane to their left and hang back to escape. the holden dangerously follows, but not before chucking an empty tinny out the window. at this point, my so decides to intervene. we also move to the left with the holden in front of us and the sedan to our left. the women look a bit scared and again change lanes to their left, so we take their spot and speed up til we're alongside the holden again. they realise what they've gotten into and now move to the right to escape us. we follow. at this point, almost all of the traffic is in the left lanes, and we're in the right lanes. we look over at them and the passenger assesses our swag-mobile and flips us off right as the driver plants his foot on the accelerator. there's no one ahead of us, and my so looks at me and says, 'watch this.' this little beema knew how to go, and go it did. we sped right up past them and made sure to be only just ahead of them. they seemed surprised by our swift acceleration and would get faster and faster to try and catch up, but we made sure to always stay juuuust in front. at just over 200kph, we pull back slightly and quickly move into the clear left lane. as i previously mentioned, it was a quiet afternoon and so there was a fair distance between cars in the busier lanes. we pull back some more and duck to the left again, then again, and then one last time as we resume cruising at the speed limit, assimilated with all the other cars. as this is happening, we see the holden continuing to hurtle along at top speed, apparently unaware that we were no longer trying to tail them. now, my so is quite competitive, and i know he would never give up that easily, especially where cars are concerned. i ask him why he let the guy go, and he replies, 'babe, you know i've been driving around here a long time. i know this road like the back of my hand. i also know exactly which of those led speed signs hanging overhead have hidden speed cameras behind them. i just gave them a little coaxing, now they'll be receiving a nice little present in the mail.' sure enough, we had levelled out just before the camera, while the d-bags had shot straight through it. **tl;dr** possibly drink driving bogans litter and scare women on the highway, get tricked into going 200kph+ through speed camera. edit: formatting.first off sorry for the amount of text, so this all happened a few years ago in sixth form, this guy had pulled a few pranks on me, nothing spectacular, just stuff like filling my bag with dry leaves, taking the ink out my pens etc. i knew i had to get him back, so i devised a diabolical plan... now a little background info, there were loads of lockers in my school, far too many in fact and so there were always a lot of lockers free so with more padlocks you could just take more lockers. other background is that we both had double chemistry on wednesday mornings and completely free afternoons, oh and also this guy cycled to school and got changed and left his things in his locker **now for the revenge:** stage one: i started preparing the friday before the planned revenge on the following wednesday, i did so by bringing every single padlock that i could find into college and taking as many lockers spread as far around the school as possible, especially targeting numbers with some significance to them like 101 etc, stage two: i began writing riddles, about 20 of them, they were no literary masterpieces but i tried my hardest to make them challenging, rhyme and require knowledge of all things spanning literature, art, classical history, science and incorporate anagrams and cryptic clues also, the answer to each clue gave the location or number of a locker, except one which led to a person who had the next riddle on him, i had made sure that the intended victim and the riddle holder had never before met. stage three: i put each riddle and the key to the next locker in an envelope with a large question mark printed on it and then put these in the corresponding lockers the day before the prank, all was now in place for the prank to go smoothly, stage four: prank day is now upon us, i make sure to walk to chemistry with the victim and remind him we need to get our lab coats from our lockers, this ensures the last time he sees his locker full he is with me, we walk up to chemistry, i have arranged for a friend of mine to 'forget' his lab coat so he has to go down and get his from his locker, he goes down to get, but quickly takes all the stuff from the victims locker, puts it in another, places the first riddle in the victim's locker and re-locks it. he then returned to the chemistry locker. stage five: the chemistry lesson is over, i return with the victim to our lockers to put our labcoats away, but wait, what's this? all his stuff his gone? o no what a surprise, he doesn't know what's happened. he reads the riddle, the gravity of the situation hits him, mwhahahaaa, i can see the cogs whirring around in his head about even the first riddle, i make my excuses and go home (at this point its about 12 o clock) and leave my victim to search for his stuff with a few of his friends trying to help him. the aftermath: i return to school the following day to find that the riddled chap didn't manage to find his stuff until just after 7 in the evening and boy o boy is he mad, especially as his stuff was in the locker next to his with the pretty difficult code '000', he's got a few suspects and unfortunately one of them is me, i remind him that it couldn't possibly be me as i was with him the whole time, but go ahead with revenge against a particularly douchey mcdoucherson whom is also a suspect by surreptitiously planting a question mark envelope in his bag, now my riddled victim has decided to just look through his prime suspects bags and lo and behold what should he find but evidence of the crime in douchey mcdoucherson's bag!!! so now victim a is furious with victim b and swears revenge upon him, for the rest of the year he was merciless with douchey mcdoucherson. tl;dr intricate web of riddles leads prankster on 7 hour search for his belongings and carefully planted evidence results in douchey mcdoucherson taking the blame for some 2 in 1 revengeso i used to work for hallmark when i was 18 and there was this one guy there who was the biggest douchebro i've ever met, i mean he dressed and acted like someone from the jersey shore ( this was before the jersey shore so i guess in his own way he was a hipster too) and he carried this knife that he kept in a holster under his armpit like a detective might carry his gun , now despite working with boxes all day the only time i ever saw him use it was to cut your drink bottle very finely so as you didn't notice the hole untill you went to take a sip and got covered in cola or whatever it was that you were drinking , well he did that to me one too many times and i thought right i'm going to fix this prick, so i grabbed a whole bunch of david hasslehoff cards ( he was wearing jeans , laying down with no shirt ) and proceeded to plaster the passenger side and rear of the car with them along with slogans such as i ♡ the cock and honk if you take it up the arse (i feel i have to mention that i have no problems with lgbt people but knew he did) so anyway he drives off without seeing them and the next day he gets into work and is looking for blood, apparently these other guys started honking their horn and pointing and laughing at him at which point douchebro starts tilting his at them ( you know the universal douchebro gesture for "come on then") any way basicly he's copping it the whole way home and when he gets back to his (parents) house his family's on the porch and they all start laughing at him , at this point he turns around to view my handywork and just loses it , it was alot of fun watching him stomp around the factory trying to figure out who was responsible but he never did. this next story isn't my personal revenge it was more like the universes revenge against this same douchebro. so anyways every wednesday all the young turks in the factory would go down the local for a couple of drinks and to play texas hold em but this one day we ended up far drunker then normal and i was spilling my drinks everywhere so i decided to head home, so i'm doing the rounds saying goodbye to everybody when i spot the douchebro up ordering a drink at the bar i get there just as the douchebro gets his drink and sparks up a smoke, now this was like a week after the ban on smoking in bars came into effect so the bartender asks him nice as pie to take it out in the beer garden ( he didn't even ask him to put it out) to which dudebro responds with "fuck you, you dog cunt" at this point i've taken like six steps back and am fully in the we got a badass here pose and decide to get while the goings good, so i go over the road to hungry jacks and order a whopper. as i'm sitting at the counter drunkenly munching on my burger when i spot at least 2 cop cars and a divi van pull into the pub across road , i know this has somthing to do with the douchebro so i head back across the road and arrive just in time to witness douchebro getting chucked in the back of the divisional van (hehe) i then head back inside to see what happened , apparently douchebro got asked to leave by one of the bouncers and he flashed his knife ( the one in the holster) and told him to "fuck off" and then thought he could keep playing poker like they weren't going to call the cops. so douchebro gets into work an hour late the next day with the biggest black eye you've ever seen and asks all the guys not to say what had happened , we were all like "you're too late we told that guy and him and him" douchebro turned red and walked out and we never saw him again . oh and the best part was that he was studying to be a p.e teacher but as he got charged with making threats to kill, carrying a concealed weapon and a whole other bunch of charges which would ensure he would never pass a working with childrens check he basicly flushed all that down the toilet.this story may be a little longer for which i apologize but there is a small back story that is needed to fully explain why i went so far in my revenge. i should also say for those grossed out easily or equally offended easily maybe dont keep reading. (although this seems to be an subreddit of epic revenges so im in the right place) some years ago i moved into a small apartment with an old friend when my partner and i fell on hard times. i should also mention that my partner was chronically ill and i was effectively a carer for her while working fulltime to support us and studying fulltime. needless to say i was stressed. the friend who was also a old high school girlfriend (whom ill refer to as cc for crazy cunt) had accepted that we move in on short notice due to a previous housemate almost killing my partner the week before through negligence. there were warning signs i should have spotted on moving in with cc but frankly we were that grateful for a roof over our head that i overlooked them. thus follows events that occurred that built up the rage that lead to revenge over the following 3 months: * when moving into the house i personally had done all the lifting and shifting of cc's stuff out of rooms so could move my stuff in then moved in every item of furniture myself. (you might say fair enough as she's letting me in but this is up 3 flights of stairs. fridges, washing machine, couches... u get the idea) not one bit of help even on the small stuff. * cc was also a crazy cat lady. she had a cat she was not allowed to have. this thing was also fucking feral. if this cat was spotted on the windows or any door was even cracked slightly where the cat could get out (or if she thought it was) she would go fucking ballistic. (**daily occurrence**) but more about the cat later * moving in i took over 2/3 of the rent and yet cc intentionally monopolized the only common area/kitchen with her druggie boyfriend at any time she was not at work. in this common room she would play romantic shitty movies at loud volume, yet the tiny offshoot room (see 'wardrobe') i used as a study even listening to something at talking volume was apparently too loud for her and would constantly have a go about it. * this cat would attack you at any chance it had. teeth and claws. yet cc thought this was cat just being friendly and would blame us for scaring it. still have scars from that fucking thing. * cc was the laziest, dirtiest bitch ive ever known. this was shown through two things. the first was that myself and partner took a two week holiday camping at some point. before we left we had asked her to clean the mass of dishes she had created and take out the single bag of garbage that was starting to smell funny. 2 weeks is enough time right? we got home and opened the door of the apartment and the smell....was...atrocious. the original bag was still there with 2 full bags of rotting junk food and meat. there was also not a clean dish in the house with it all piled up on the sink. upon getting back she was hungover on the couch with her idiot boyfriend and expected us to clean it up for her. * cc had complained non stop about how much of a horrible housemate her previous shared living people had been. all of them. this raised alarm bells but i should have realized how much. cc had vendettas against all of them and intentionally fucked with them and their lives whenever she could. this we found out when my partner borrowed cc's contact solution and it immediately burnt her eyes. a previous tenant had added dishwashing soap to try and get revenge on cc. * the cat. she never changed the kitty litter and what she fed that damned thing stank when it came out. this was in a tiny apartment with the litter box in the shared and cramped toilet/shower. most showers would be spent gagging and dry wretching. despite repeated requests to fix it cc would carry on like a petulant teenager and rarely do anything about it. also more about this later. * the usual stories of shitty housemates of stealing food and clothing items and/or selling them to pay for getting pissed/high on the weekend applied as well. so after just under 3 months we had had enough. there was more but those are the easiest to explain, it would probably be double the length if i covered everything. so a plan was formed. we were going to wait for her to go out to work for the day them move out in style. as soon as she was gone we pulled the trailer around and started loading up all our furniture. this was also when we started discovering some things. at some point cc had set fire to and burnt all of our tea towels. strange but thats what we found. as well as that she had not been putting the kitty litter in the bin after all. instead she had been bagging it and then double bagging it and then pulling it **all** in a 40l tub in the same bathroom. had moved it maybe a metre which explained why the smell never ever left the room let alone the apartment. she had spent a time telling us it was old clothes she was storing... so first of all we called up cc's rental agency and told them we would be moving out and it turned out she had never informed them we were moving in nor about any of the previous tenants. this was a major breach of her contract which was effectively guaranteed she was going to be evicted no matter what. but we decided to add photos and video of the cat she had and playing with the cat which meant she had broken her contract further meaning she copt a $500 fine to clean and sanitize the apartment following her eviction. it was satisfying knowing that she had been in there for 2 years but this was not where it ended. she was fairly randy especially after a weekend at a rave and would flaunt how much she was having with her boyfriend and her fetishes while she knew i barely had time for my girl supporting us. knowing she had a draw full of sex toys i was...mean. if any of you are familiar with a product called blairs hot sauce you've got an idea of where im going. i used the one known as ultra death. putting a thin coating over her larger toys that she would brag about often. this stuff was pretty potent. needless to say she was going to be in for a shock next time it was happy time. i wish i could say this was where the story ended. cc tried to get revenge 2 months later by sending pics of a pregnant belly to my girl with personal information as if i had cheated and knocked someone up. fortunately my girl saw through it immediately. so in return my girl, who worked for major utility company, got cc's power cut at her new address and kept it disabled for 2 weeks caught up in red tape that all seemed totally legitimate. **tl:dr crazy housemate fucks with myself and my girl and lives in a disgusting fashion, gets her evicted, sex toys coated in hot chilli for that extra warming sensation and power cut for 2 weeks** edit: tired of the constant messages claiming falsehood and embellishment. if your so certain its false read the comments that bad up the facts you might think you can see through. im not going to write every single detail. it would get in the way of telling a straight forward story. when my father was in the army he lived in on-base government barracks, sort of like apartments. one of the guys in his building would make a ton of racket every morning very early, with his motorcycle. he would rev it loudly for a solid 10 minutes before leaving. he had been asked by others not to do this, but he ignored them all. so one night, my dad got out there with some wire clippers and clipped every electrical wire on that motorcycle that he could find at both ends, removing the cables he clipped out as he went along. the bike looked fine, but, naturally, all exposed wiring was missing. he never heard that guy revving his motorcycle again. he knows it was repaired, but the guy finally got the message.i had passive aggressive room mates when i was in my trades training in the military. they usually have a course room together, 4 to a room, so that they can study together, help each other out and generally build some esprit de corpe. our course was odd numbered so there was only 3 on our course in the room, and 1 guy from my trade in our room, but his course was just finishing. he was a good guy, and i got along great with him. my room mates were passive aggressive douche bags who hated him. (passive aggressive, putting their bed space and furniture together with the tv and stereo on their side facing them so neither he nor i could see the tv or turn down the volume, or even use the stereo when they weren't around, whereas everyone else sharing rooms shared their gear and equipment) he and i were smokers, and the douches weren't. this guy smoked two packs a day to my one, and that's why they hated him. they whined and cried to our course mom (nco in charge of anything we needed as to admin, or leave requests etc.), and he was removed. got a new room mate, a guy i was friends with that went through basic with me. he didn't believe the shit i told him about these two until he moved in and saw how they had arranged the room. again, they hated him because he told them to shut the fuck up when they cried at him about coming in late from a night exercise and waking them by mistake. i couldn't tell them off since they were in my class, but he could, and he never took their shit. again, to the course mom and boom he is gone. now it is just the three of us. they focused their crap on me and i just let it slide. i would go to sleep and they would turn on the tv loud, i would be studying and they would crank the stereo to 80's pop rock, which i hated. they would "accidentally" spill stuff on my clean uniform while i was out so i would have to rewash it an hour before inspection. they finally pissed me off when the divoted ( the act of scuffing the black polish off the leather so it is raw brown leather) my parade boots that i had spent over 100 hours polishing for the rcaf anniversary parade. again, they claimed it was an accident. they both went to one of their parents places over a long weekend and i went to work. never fuck with the top of your class in an electronics trade. i took their stereo, amp, and tv to the crs (communications radar systems) lab and re-built the power amps on the volume and power amp for the stereo, amp, and tv. from 95 db down to 30 db. then i sealed it all up and returned them to the room. since all of my course was from the same province as my base was located in, they were all gone and no one saw me take or return the stuff to the barracks. when they returned, they couldn't figure out what was wrong since the factory seals were in place, and the stuff was in the exact same position when they left. at the same time i had bought a ghetto boom box with a capital g that pumped out a booming 100db and started playing pink floyd as loud as it would go, followed up with deep purple, all of which they called "druggie music". this went on for 4 weeks. afterwards, the course mom calls me into his office to let me know that they complained again, since the were non-smokers and i smoked, that they wanted me moved. i was pissed, but before i could get mad, the course mom said, "they are only allowed 3 room mate moves, so whoever they get for a room mate they are now stuck with for the next 4 months." then he winked at me. i was baffled as to what the wink meant. after class i went up to my old room to move my stuff to my new room. grabbed my stuff and went down to my new room, walked in and there were my two old room mates. damn was i glad to see they were my new roomies. as i finished moving in, i went to grab the last of my stuff, and the douches new roomies were moving in. 2 french canadian guys who smoked 3 packs a day each. i laughed for a day. thanks course mom. near the end of my stay there, the base had a conglomeration of guys in my trade in different courses, and whenever enough of them get together they always have epic parties. my roomy who finished his trades training made me first promise not to tell they guys on my course about the party, then he gave me the date and time. my course had heard about the party but they didn't know where it was going to be. i told them it was at a bar in town 40km's from the base starting at 21:00 hrs, but it was at the junior ranks bar on the far side of the base starting at 19:00hrs. best party ever. the next monday, they all knew they went to the wrong place, and i told them it was a great party that they weren't wanted at. best revenge ever. even the guys in their own trade wanted nothing to do with them. p.s. douche took his stereo, amp, and tv in for repairs, but his warranty was voided because the set had been "repaired" by a non-authorized repairman. to this day, so many years later, i wonder if they ever figured it out. tl;dr: careful who you fuck with and careful how much you whine.years ago when i was just starting out in the world i got a job as a laborer at a medium sized machine rental shop in northern alberta. this was my very first real job and i put up with a lot of shit because it was 24$ an hour for zero experience and zero training. the main source of my discontent came from a man we will call ass-hat. ah was a nepotism hire, he married into the company owner's family and was given a job to shut his wife up or something. ah took verbally abusing me, calling me stupid, threatening to fire me ...etc virtually every chance he got. i was getting fed up and close to my breaking point when an opportune chance for revenge presented it's self. in that area of northern ab we had a problem with huge crows picking through garbage for food, these birds are massive and ravenous. early one morning i was taking out the office trash and i noticed parked close the dumpster was ah's brand new penis compensation (ford 350 with a lift and a few thousand $ worth of chrome ). bypassing the dumpster i proceeded to ah's truck and with a heave i threw 3 bags full of refuse into his box. within minutes a veritable swarm developed around their new found meal. the crows gorged themselves on the trash and once satiated decided to use this month old vehicle as a communal toilet. fly my pretties fly! muahahaha. all this happened at 9 am and ah did not leave the shop until close the 10 hours late, that's 10 hours worth of crow shit to clean off. as much as i was suspected it never came back to bite me and i eventually quit to go back to school. tldr - i unleashed a murder of crows to defecate on a brand new pick up truck. edit- it should read "let slip the crows of war " - thanks u/migz968 for the correction.i'm not sure of this is pro enough for this sub, but here goes. i live with about 11 people. my family of four, my aunt, her husband, and three kids. my other aunt, and my grandma. it was a full house, so to say. a couple years ago, my mom was doing my hair, along with my best friends hair, for a party we had later on that evening. my uncle, who's like a father to me, storms down the stairs to where i was and starts berating me in our native language. he's speaking so fast, i can barely understand what he's saying. after a few minutes of just sitting there shell shocked, i've figured it out. the cable bill came in and there were three charges for adult movies. he automatically thought it was me, me being the eldest in the house. my parents are called, and i'm being chastised by all of them. i'm instantly grounded, with a promise of a belting later on. i did get to go to the party though, only because my friend was meant to sleep over after the party. this happened on a friday. the next week was stressful and a living hell. i wasn't allowed to hang with friends and whatnot, but i was allowed to stay after school till the late bus pucked us up. that was my cool down time, my relaxing time. that got taken away. my parents are ultra conservative and can sometimes be mean spirited. my mother wouldn't speak to me, my uncle was still angry, and ask the kids stayed away from me, cause at this point, i was collateral damage. i don't blame them. my family can be scary. the only person i had on my side was my aunt, the one with the husband and kids. she said she believed me when i said it wasn't me. tbh, i do watch porn. however, i'm not dumb enough to order it on demand, not once, not twice, but three dammed times. not bragging, but i'm much too smart for that. hearing her say she was on my side spurred me into action. i called the cable company and asked them if it was possible to see which cable box a movie was ordered from. they told me yes, that i would need to get the serial numbers of the cable boxes seeing as how they could only confirm or deny if that box was the culprit. took me a full weekend to this. the bedrooms were hardly ever empty, so i had to be quick, and undetected. after i got all of the numbers, i called the company back and lo and behold, the videos weren't ordered from my cable box, but rather, the one in the room right across from mine! my younger cousin, almost a brother, had let me take all of the blame for his bullshit. he'd even come up yo me and told me 'everything was gonna be okay". bull fucking shit. okay for him maybe. i was fucking livid at that point. i wanted to go down there and beat him to a pulp. but i didn't. the weekend was a day away. the whole family would be there. if wait till then. i was home half an hour earlier than him. i was seated when he opened up the front door. he smiled and greeted me, and the smile i gave him back must have told him that the gig was up. he was busted. i told him that i knew, but i wasn't gonna tell the parents. he was. he had till sunday night. chocking back tears, he told me that he was sorry, and that he would confess. i waited, and waited. nothing. saturday passed by, and not a word was spoken. i did hear his parents ask him of he was alright, he did look a little ill. sunday was the same thing. i waited and waited, but the poor sod refused to say a word. i confronted him and told him his time was up. he begged me to tell them instead, but i wanted to punish him. he made his bed, and by gods was i going to help tuck him in. he still refused to say anything, so i called down my mother, told her that he has something to tell her. you see, my mother was the most feared adult in the house. she comes down looking confused, but willing to listen. i tell her that he's got something very important to tell her, and i walk away. i go into the other room and 45 seconds later, i hear a very shocked and angry "what??!!". part of me feels bad, but not that much. my mother is angry, she's shocked, and she's embarrassed. you see, a dat before i found out who the culprit was, we had gotten in an argument, her, my uncle, and i. the two of them had been pestering, and nagging at me to confess. fed up, i asked my uncle " why not ask your son too? you're breathing down my back, accusing me of something i didn't do, yet you haven't asked any of your kids any questions!" that earned me a few choice of words that would make a whore working the corners blush. that's the day i started losing respect for him. anyway, back to the moment of truth. uncle comes strutting into the living room, looking at me with a snug smile on his face, thinking that i had finally caved and was ready to confess. and boy was he wrong. i've never seen a black man go so red, so fast. he was furious. all his anger and embarrassment was thrown at my cousin full force. i'm the end, my cousin got a spanking. and he was grounded. his teli was taken from him and to this day, almost 5 yeats layer, he's not allowed to watch teli. oh wait! don't go! there's more! fast forward to august 2014. the whole family is taking a trip to canada, but my aunt is having some issues. she had recently lost my cousin's immigration papers, so he can't travel any where until they get new ones. her two other kids don't even have passports, and she only had enough money for one of them. she was planning on taking my little cousin, jane, and leaving the two boys, james (cousin of this story) and jake (middle child), at home with the grandmas. although i really can't afford it, i offer to pay jake's passport. why? so james can stay home all alone with grandma. the whole family will be on vacation, except that little maggot. revenge is like good pizza. great while its served hot, but still oh so good the next day even when cold. yum! *edit* there are a few things i'd like to clear up. some of you think my family is abusive, but they are not. and no, i don't suffer from any kind of stockholm syndrome. we may not seem normal to you, and why should we? we come from a country where it isn't illegal to beat your child as an act of discipline. they even sell belts just for that. but i can assure you that my family has never hit us without cause, and even then, (at least for my mother) her hits are louder than they are painful.it's more for show than anything else really. this is the norm from where i come from. however, my parents have changed once seeing how things are done here. now, if there is a problem, it's talked (yelled?) out, phones are taken away and such. i haven't been hit in years, and nor has my cousin. i don't know many abusive parents that can admit when they're wrong and try changing their ways. also, as for my cousin, the number one reason he doesn't have a teli in his bedroom is because his room is in the basement. his room was moved down there not as a punishment, but because we renovated and added two new bedrooms down there so he could be somewhat more comfortable. where his room, the tv can get flooded. so he watches tv in the family room, or mine. he did something shitty, faced the consequences, and that's it. i have a really good friend who used to work on a resort island off the east coast of australia. it was a fantastic lifestyle and he really had a great time. after about 2 years of happily partying and shagging tourists and having an exceptional time of it things started to go downhill, in the form of a bully. he had two mates and they were picking on my friend and taunting him. the ringleader was a huge maori (native new zealander) guy and there was no way he could stand up to them without getting bashed. so... they don't realize he is a pro in revenge (oh the stories i can tell), and he sets his mind to getting his own back. on a friday night when the island club is really starting to kick and everyone is there he heads for the kitchen. armed with a commercial size botlle of fish sauce he then heads back for the head bullies room. he poured it over everything! in his bed, over all of his clothes, in his luggage, in his shoes, into his shampoo and closed it again... everything. it kind of dawned on him that he'd better start packing now otherwise he's going to get bashed really badly. but the only problem is, he's on an island. there is one ferry a day that goes back to the mainland in the morning. he went and packed his bags and had a brilliant idea... shave time. no more beard, nor moustache, no more long hair. 1/2 an hour later he's off and hiding in the bush waiting for the ferry to come. 8 hours later or so the ferry starts boarding and he walks down the jetty towards it. and there stood just at the gangplank is the 2 followers making sure he doesn't leave. one of them points to him and says "isn't that him?" to which the other replies, "no, he's got long hair and a beard"... he walked staright passed them and got on the ferry. great success! more of the same guy here /r/prorevenge/comments/1jef8m/lights_out/i worked security for two years with a company, and before that i had worked a year at another security company, so i can say with confidence the general attitude is that we're in this together being contractors, so security officers stick together. maybe not a thin blue (tan?) line like police, but we definitely looked after each other. one coworker at a site i stayed at for about a year wasn't like that though. she straight up told everybody that her job was to man the computer and interact with the people coming and going from the guard shack. she didn't even do those two tasks particularly well, since there were numerous complaints about her attitude with guests and another coworker who turned into a good friend of mine was always having to correct her work. she refused to make small talk as well, which might have suited the customer's security guy fine, but kinda chafed with us other guards. our site supervisors had to twist her arm to get her to accept overtime or even go out on patrol, and any time there was a lull she was on her phone, flagrantly breaking the rules in front of the cameras. she had even (allegedly but i wouldn't put it past her) admitted to my friend that if she ever had the chance to screw someone else to make herself look good she would. calling her a cunt would be an insult to female reproductive organs as she lacked the warmth and depth. she was in good with the upper management of our company, however, so she got away with being a really shitty desk clerk. one of our myriad duties as security officers at that site was to ensure a plethora of keys were properly controlled and accounted for. this mostly meant making sure people signed them out properly and filling out a spreadsheet at the start of each shift. well one evening i'm pulling a 12 hour shift, so i'm there in the middle of second shift, which my friend worked the desk. for whatever reason he was going through the key box, when lo and behold a key was missing. looking through the log there wasn't a concrete entry for it, but we had suspicion on one entry early in first shift, so it likely had been out since that morning. well coworker one stays till an hour into second shift, so she generally got a few reports done before she left. as it turned out she had listed said key as being in the key box when she checked. once this was realized both coworker 2 and i had shit-eating, cheshire cat grins on our faces. of course we had to make it look official, so since i was going to be taking over the desk when coworker 2 left it would be down to me. i'm not much of an actor, but i really nailed the surprised concern with my third shift partner as i discovered the key was missing, checked the logs, and then checked coworker 1's sheet. of course a missing key required an incident report, and i did not hold back. i attached a copy of the log sheet and the key report, which had coworker 1's initials and the time she filled out the report. i also had to inform first shift about the report in turnover, but fortunately coworker 1 came in an hour after first shift started. that incident report was the last straw, and last i heard about it they were going to replace coworker 1, but i left that post about two months later and was fired just last week for unrelated reasons. i think i earned the slight fear of a few of the other guards thanks to that. and to head off such comments: i'm not a blue falcon. were it anyone else i would have let the client contact do the legwork on investigating, and i'm sure it would have called for a reprimand, but since she had a history of screwing up paperwork i think it was just the final nail in the coffin. i also am not normally that vicious, but by that point i was fucking done with that site for several other reasons, so that was me getting some anger out. but boy did it feel good.this story isn't for the karma or any of that bullshit. this is a throwaway account because i don't need my girlfriend (among other people) learning about this story as it relates to my involvement in it. so i play in a band and hang out with a lot of other guys in bands. if you listen to van warped tour kind of music, there's a chance you may be familiar with our work. here is the thing about bands: they share woman very candidly. once a girl starts dating a guy in a band, she's off limits. don't touch her. it creates drama not only between the two guys, but between the two bands as well. record labels and managers especially hate that drama, so it's in everyones best interest to never, ever cheat with a girl dating a guy in another band. it's an unspoken but well-known fact. another well known fact is that, once a girl is single, regardless of who she has dated in the past, she is fair game. guys don't usually raise a huge fuss when their ex bangs another guy from another band... it's almost expected. in hockey you have "puck-bunnies", in bands you have "band-bitches". it is what it is. so i get a call from a girl, call her j. she was engaged to the singer of a band who you may be familiar with as they have found commercial success. j calls me up and says "lets get together tonight". now, i know what this means. long and short of it is that we hung out, smoked a bit and had some beers and hooked up. now, she was not wearing an engagement ring and she claimed she and her ex were completely done. i was out on tour so i had no idea of their status... and she led me to believe that it had been this way for a while. once i found out she lied, i took charge and wanted to let the guy know i just hooked up with his "ex" (current?) fiance. i felt terrible and knew it needed to be done. here's where the drama starts. she denies every-single-thing. she claims it never happened and that i am a total liar. now, this band bitch has some pull. she knows people all over the industry and because she was so pissed that i tried to fuck her over (tell the truth?) she started a campaign against me. her fiance and her told everyone i was making shit up and trying to get attention from other bands. in reality, i was just trying to do what i viewed as the right thing. now, this went on for months. and months. and months. i would get calls in the middle of the night where one of them would call me, or both at the same time (for real) bitching me out. i lost a lot of good friends who "sided" with them and wanted nothing to do with me. fast forward another few months. they break up for real. like, for real. she ends up hitting me up again (total band bitch) and asks to hang out. we end up fucking and she thinks the whole past year or so is just the funniest thing. after getting her pretty stoned, i pull out my phone and i start taking photos of her (these will not be shared fellas). i got photos of her from behind while fucking, from on top, from everywhere. she was so into being photographed that she started taking photos of herself getting real dirty. month or so later we get a call and wouldn't you know it, we're scheduled by our label to meet up and play six shows together with this band (the one who the singer was with j). now originally, i was thinking about maybe just texting these photos to the guy and being like "yo, fuck you"... but it wasn't enough. so i'm pondering what the hell to do in my mind, and nothing seems to click, until i realized something! this band did a song where their "backdrop" was a bunch of photos and shit. i don't want to go into detail other than that, however the program that ran the backdrop was controlled by their guitar-tech on side stage right. it was a simple program that ran the photos... it was matched to a click track so they changed with the beat of the song. on our last night with this band, we're on the east coast. a fellow bandmate of mine and myself figured out what program the tech used, what the "click rate" was on the track and after 5 nights of watching, how it was all set up (really easy... just plug your computer in and the images project on a huge ass screen behind the drummer). when it was time for them to play the song that uses the photos, we waited until they started. after 10 seconds or so of them playing to the normal backdrop, my guitar tech called theres away and i plugged my mac in instead of his. i waited for the beat to hit and i clicked the space-bar. with the beat of the music, pictures of j slopping my dick, fingering herself and dancing around my house naked were displayed behind the band. they went 20 - 30 seconds before the band noticed, another 2 minutes before it stopped. the mother fuckers kept playing, and best of all, the singer stood there in front of a cheering crowd who loved it, forcing him to act like it was "part of the show". he was pissed. you couldn't tell it was me in the photos, but it was my mac plugged in and because of my history with his ex, he figured it out pretty quickly. i got jumped that night by him and two dudes when i was smoking a cig out back. punched in the face 4 or 5 times and kicked pretty hard in the ribs once or twice. i felt like it was pretty fair, i didn't fight back or retaliate. just laughed my ass off while getting fucked up. worth every bruise and the black eye. dmitry agarkov received a credit card offer in the mail from tinkoff credit systems. after reading the fine print, he found that he disagreed with much of their terms, so he reprinted an identical copy of the application, but his terms stipulated 0% interest, no fees, and no credit limit. he also included clauses penalizing tinkoff for any modifications or breakings of the contract. he sent in the application, and the company sent him a card, thereby approving it and accepting agarkov's modified terms. two years later, tinkoff sued agarkov for failure to pay fees and interest. the judge ruled in agarkov's favor, ruling that he only pay the balance remaining on the card (~$500 usd). he has since countersued for approximately $914k usd, citing his various clauses for penalties associated with breaking the contract. a ruling has not yet been issued for his countersuit. source: so i was told to post this here, and after coming here and reading, i have a new favorite sub! was dating this girl for awhile, things were going very, very well. or so i thought, i found out that she had cheated on me. i'll skip a bunch of stuff, but we ended up working it out. (i should have walked away, yes i know. but then i wouldn't have this funny to tell you.) so everything goes back to normal, i was working roughly 12-18 hour days trying to get my business started. she was going to college at the time. so there wasn't a lot of time that we got to spend together, but when we did, it was amazing. loved her, feeling was mutual, blah blah blah. well about 6 months after we got back together my friend sends me a pic, it's my so and a guy that he lives with. she's orally pleasuring him on the couch (the roommate, not my friend). so of course, i was highly pissed. was paying for this girls education, a place for her to live, etc. so i decided that i was leaving. well ended up texting her and saying that i was going out of town for a couple of days, knowing that would make her not come back to the house for awhile. i decided in a drunken stupor to get revenge. not by burning her clothes, trashing her name, or making her life hell. but by dipping her vibrators in jalpeneo juice. i left, got the usual wtf messages. i didn't even bother responding to them. then about a week later i got the mother of all texts. it was glorious, if i still had the transcript i would post them here. but there's my story. hope you enjoyed it.alright, so my now ex girlfriend was letting some of her homeless friends stay with us for cheap rent. i woke up one day and my phone was gone. the odd part was i left it in between both my wallets, and those were there. i immediately thought it was them but nobody would believe me. "you probably just don't know where you left it!" so i bring up find my iphone on the computer, and it shows nothing. i leave it up just in case. i should also mention methhead1 and methhead2 are gone, they said they were going to the mall last night. so we're all looking around and stuff, and lo and behold, guess what shows up on my map? my phone is magically at the mall! now she believed me. so we called them, and they said it must have been a break in, but they would look for it. i also called all the phone shops and mall security in case they tried to sell it. i get a call back later, they said they found it! some asshole had it, and they beat him up for it! wow, that's literally unbelievable. so i tell him that's good, when i get the phone i'll be able to plug it in and see who it was that was looking at the phone when it was turned on, thanks to a security app (that doesn't actually exist). "oh, you might see pictures of me doing funny shit in the camera...haha *choke*" so they get home, and those bastards stole my sim card. luckily it's a cdma iphone 4s, so it isn't really needed. they also tried to reset it, but it just ended up being icloud locked. i thank them profusely, and just leave the phone on my desk to let them stew. they look nervous as fuck, so i drag it out a bit, talking about how i don't really feel like checking who it was tonight. the next morning, i kick them out, and don't give them a refund on that months rent. they went off on us, saying how they helped us and we were horrible people, ect... throwing a fit and denying it, screaming and talking about how they were going to break shit. enjoy being homeless, cunts. they are still living on the street. i still see them sitting on the street from time to time while doing errands. my buddies and i rented a house during/after college. big place, 6 of us living there with two dogs and a fat indoor cat (mine. still with me, still fat). next door lived a gentleman, who i shall call meathead. meathead worked out a lot and was constantly agressive and rude. we always thought 'roids, but thats just guessing. 3 of my room mates were in a band and would practice in the garage. garage was covered in foam and was not that loud. meathead called the cops twice and was told we were not doing anything wrong. later on we had a huge party at our house. we got permits from the city and had the band play. meathead called the cops again and we had to stop everything and sort it out for a half hour. as the cops are leaving, meathead, who has been watching from the sidewalk, starts yelling "search the house for drugs! the're a bunch of crackheads!" (we were not; we were stoners) cops leave, band plays, party goes on. a few week later, my buddy and i get home one night and find the garage door busted in and the band equipment fucked up. drums slashed and power cords sliced. the speaker covers were dented but undamaged. (we figured kicked?) we call the cops and report it. we are all kinda scared of meathead, so we don't say anything. but the cops know all about us and go over to talk with him. don't know what happened, but meathead goes away in cuffs. the police report never mentioned him and as far as we know, it is still unsolved. cops wouldn't tell us what was up, just to stay out of his way. the band knows their way around second hand music, so wires get spliced/replaced and drums are fixed. ended up being $200-ish. when we next see meatheat, 4 of us are in the front yard. he says, "how's your band sounding", real smug. until now, we have all gotten together and said we should not push this guy's buttons. but the drummer shoots back with "great! how your asshole feel?" meathead loses it and attacks him. we don't make a good show of ourselves; kicks all our asses. but the cops come after he leaves and he is arrested again. we press charges and get a restraining order against him. now, remember the dogs? 2;a little dobie-mutt and a weiner dog with 3 legs. they were a yippie pair, so they were inside most times. walks and the dog park and outback twice a day for nature. about a month after the fight, my buddy takes the dogs out back then brings them both inside and tells me to come outside. i go and there are bits of meat all over, like steak strips. wrapped in most are chocolate and we found unknown pills in some. most of them are towards meatheads house. dogs are never let out back again. drummer loses it; both dogs are his. but any thing happens and meathead is going to think it's us; we don't want to test the restraining order that much. we wait 2 months till the other 4 roomies are going out of town for a week: 3 to a wedding back east and 1 on work. drummer and i make a plan to go up to napa for 4 days and make a big fuss about asking the other neighbors on the street to watch the place. we rent a hotel room and everything. 2 nights in, we have a buddy who lives in the area stay in the hotel room with his girl and tell him to order some movies. we drive back. meathead has a truck that he loves; tricked out 4 wheel drive with chrome and a custom paint job. when we get there around midnight and the truck wasn't there. we eat at denny's and the truck still isn't there at 1. a blunt later and, at 2 am, the truck is there. we siphon off as much gas as we can and fill it with unleaded. toothpaste is rubbed on that tailgate art. drive back up to napa (about 6 hours all told) and tell our buddy to get some clothes on, we want to get some sleep! when we got back the truck wasn't in the drive way and we never saw it again. meathead moved out maybe 6 months later. we never told the others about it until he was gone, and in our group's legends the amount of shit we did get bigger everytime :) tl;dr: dude smashes our stuff, attacks us, and try to kill our dogs. we ruin his truckin high school, jack and stefan hated each other. one day, stefan took it too far and got jack in a lot of trouble with the school, which had repercussions at home, with his personal life, etc., so jack hatched a plan. he knew stefan had a sweet tooth. he knew stefan liked to gloat and brag. he knew stefan didn't like to share. jack went to a chemist and bought the largest available bar of laxative chocolate available. keep in mind that we were children, so it was a lot of money at the time. jack then bought a bar of cadbury chocolate, very carefully pulled apart the wrapping, put in the laxative chocolate and resealed it. at school the next day, in our weekly extended lunchtime registration (where we did all school announcements, group activities, that bullshit), jack gifted stefan with a big bar of cadbury chocolate as a peace offering, saying he hoped it would patch things up between them. stefan snatched the chocolate and paraded it around the room, opened it up, told everyone they couldn't have a piece, and ate this huge amount of chocolate in under a minute. to date, it's the fastest i've seen someone eat. i should mention that the recommended dosage was four squares. he easily ate sixty. stefan ran out of the room, and we didn't see him for three days. edit: as /u/loghead11 pointed out, it may not be common knowledge that this is fucking dangerous.i moved into an apartment in the first floor of a complex. my next-door neighbor owned a large bird (looked to be over 18") that made loud noises most of the day and often throughout the night. my roommate and i approached the neighbor (bird owner, or bo) a few times over the course of 6 months asking him to please keep his bird quiet. bo said he would the first few times, but then would just tell us to mind our "own fucking business" after that. we would speak with other tenants in the building as we would see them in the hallways and in the parking lot and they had issues with bo for the incessant bird squawking too. i called the management office to file a complaint, and they said they would need to investigate - which they eventually did. unfortunately, the bird was quiet when the 'investigator' came out, and nobody in bo's apartment answered the door. so, nothing came of it. the squawking continued day and night and i recorded some of it and played it to the management office while filing another complaint. they said there was no way to prove that the recording i played was from bo, and that they needed to witness the noise disturbance first hand. traditional channels were not working, so i decided to try something different. i looked up what type of bird this was and found recordings online of the different sounds they made. i located the sound that meant, "warning! predators in the area! hide and be silent!" i put the speakers from my home audio system against the wall that was adjacent to bo's apartment and every time that damn bird began to squawk i would play the "warning!" bird call at full volume. the bird would shut up for 15-30 minutes. this went on for a while, but it was by no means a perfect solution, as the bird would still squawk at random times and wake me up at night. i ran into some of my other neighbors and we got to talking again about the annoying bird. they told me that the bird was getting louder and completely out of hand. i realized that they were not only complaining about the bird's actual noises, but the "warning" recordings i was playing. this gave me an idea. i searched for more recordings made by this particular breed of bird and began playing them loudly to see how the bird would react. there was one specific sound that incited rage in the bird and it would go nuts for 30 minutes or more. i began playing this sound randomly throughout the day at times i knew bo was home - the bird would go crazy and squawk loudly every time, and bo could do nothing to stop it. i heard bo yelling at the bird, banging on the bird's cage, and then other people yelling at each other from that apartment. this was amazing! i could ruin their day! so i started playing the rage sound a few times every night, and the bird would go insane. i heard people yelling, items being thrown, and over all of it, the bird completely losing its shit. after a few days of doing this it sort of lost its sheen, so i called the management team and filed another complaint stating that the bird was making the noise right now, and that they needed to send someone to investigate. the person on the phone said that they were already planning on sending someone due to the large number of complaints they had received over the past few days, and that they would be out within 10 minutes. i got off the phone and played the rioting bird call - the crazy bird reacted just like before and went nuts. the investigator showed up soon after, the bird still screaming, and they had their evidence. a week later bo was gone, and so was that bird. the vacated apartment was left destroyed. the apartment management had crews in and out of that place for weeks ripping out carpeting and flooring, replacing damaged drywall, appliances, and fixtures. they had kept the bird in the bathroom, in and out of a large cage, and everything was covered in bird shit. what i learned: a bird in the bathtub is worth two fists in your goddamn face.at the tender age of 19, i married my high school sweetheart who had just turned 18. she literally had just turned 18, and i was proud to have a ring on my finger and be able to call her my wife. we have been married for almost a year now, and while it is not marital bliss, we are still enjoying life to the fullest. she is wonderful to me in every way, and i cannot imagine life without my wife. whats even more enjoyable is her extended family. i come from a very small family. my father, an adopted child, never really knew his real parents, but grew up well nonetheless. my mother too lived in a sort of broken home, and both of my parents had to grow up almost dirt poor. as you can imagine, living dirt poor has had an effect on me as well. as small as my family is, my in-laws make up even more of my family, with my wife having a larger family then mine could ever have. i am giving you this small history lesson for a reason. you see, my wife has a great-grandmother that is one of the sweetest ladies in existence. she is kind, beautiful, funny and been through so much, i regard her with great wisdom and love. the woman has lived through generations of technology, grew up in the great depression, and has seen almost every major war this country has been embroiled in. marrying young to a carpenter, they grew their family as much as they could, sewing love and a hard work ethic into their kids at a very young age. her husband was the kind of guy that hated hospitals, and didn't need the finer things in life. he once put a nail through his hand, cursed out loud, pulled the nail out, and sealed the wound with carpenters glue. he was a man's man in every sense of the word. he passed in 2012, and you can imagine that she is now very lonely and heartbroken without him. now that you know a little about this woman, you can imagine my shock and complete rage when i found out someone had smashed my great-grandmother-in-law's (is that the right word?) custom-made mailbox. it had been hand-carved by her husband, and was something she loved so much, because he made it before he passed. apparently, she found it smashed right outside her house, and she cried for hours. several young teenagers grew up on the road where g-gma lived, so i had my idea on who broke the mailbox in the first place. so, i did what anyone would of done, and cooked up a plan for revenge. i built my g-gma another wooden mailbox, and made it out of a very pliable and thin wood. i am not a carpenter by any means, and it was an incredibly ugly mailbox. i placed it outside and waited for the fools to destroy it. sure enough, it was found in literal pieces the next day, right around 3-6 o'clock. so, i built another one, out of the same material, and placed it outside just like before. i needed to make sure exactly when the fools came by. for this, i waited at her house for the exact time. at 4:00pm, a screaming and hollering alerted me to the front of the house, where several idiots driving a large, red truck came flying down the road. they drove past the mailbox, and boom, it shattered into a billion pieces as one of the idiots smashed it with a steel bat. they yelled in jubilation, and i had guessed that the destruction of my mailboxes had become routine, as it shattered very easily from the bat. now understanding what time they came around, i built another mailbox, and made it easily destructible. it was ugly in every way, and i made it even more flimsy then the first two. i installed it like normal, and the next day, waited for the mailman to drop off the mail. i realized how ugly it was when the mailman gave it a concerned look, as if he were afraid if he reached into it, he would gain thousands of splinters and maybe aids. picking up the mail, i promptly replaced the mail inside with a large, cement cinder block. it barely fit inside the mailbox, but it was concealed quite nicely. i knew that at the speed they usually went, and the bat they used, this could serious screw up whoever was striking the mailbox, but at the time, i did not care in the slightest. sure enough that day, they came around at 4:00pm. flying down the road, the bumbling idiots screamed as their batter got ready. clang. a scream echoed out across town and the truck sped off quicker then usual. i have no idea what kind of damage was done, but you better believe that was the last time someone bothered destroying my g-gma's mailbox. if you enjoyed this story, please read my blog for more stories from my life. i also must thank you redditers for your great stories of revenge. i had to put this up for all to see. my blogs link is i go to the movies with my so and its her choice. ends up being hunger games. oh well im 35 and i can can handle a chick flick for a bit. theater is packed. few minuts in i nicely ask the 4 young teenage girls to keep their voices down. over the the next half hour i know everything about their simple teen lives because they wont shut up. phones on the whole time. i get a little more firm and then angry with them. then a plan comes together. i had a huge soda in my hand and carefully carve a hole in the bottom with a key and plug it with my finger. say to my so were out of here. i get up to leave, then standing in the isle and i say sorry to the teans for getting angry with them and if the one on the end could hold my soda while i put on my jacket. girl takes my soda holding it over her lap, we then speed walk as fast as i can to the exit, im a few feet from the door and i hear the most satisifying horror movie scream man has ever heard. there was this shitty family in my neighborhood growing up, called the simmons. i could go on for days about how awful they all are, but this story is about the youngest one, jessica. my brother craig, best friend cici and i all played with her. this happened when we were all 7-8 years old. jessica was a chubby, spoiled little brat. she lied, would throw fits if she didn't get her way, and tried (unsuccessfully) to play cici and i against each other. we were all getting sick of her, and things came to a head one week when she thought it would be funny to push both cici and i into her sprinkler. fed up with her lies, her efforts to ruin our friendship, and the fact that we both had to walk home soaking wet within days of each other, cici and i decided we had had enough of jessica. so she, my brother and i devised a plan. we filled up a bucket of water balloons, and both my brother's super soakers. then we walked down the street, and asked jessica to come play with us. we were all playing nicely in my backyard. i snuck off and grabbed the bucket of balloons, and hit her in the back with one. before she could react, cici ran over, turned on the hose, and attacked jessica with cold, musty, water while i continued my balloon assault. as jessica ran around the other side of the house, sobbing, with us, the hose and the balloons hot on her heels, we screamed "now craig!" and my brother jumped out super soaker in hands, blocking her path, and soaked whatever spots we had missed. after unloading and entire soaker onto her, he picked up a second gun, and chased her all the way down our driveway (we lived on a hill). we laughed until my mom called us in for dinner. she had watched the whole thing. she did not stop us, or even mention it. she told me years later that she never liked jessica. not my story, but my friend's, an act of revenge he did back in the 90s with a scumbag landlord of his. he lived at this apartment in dallas for a while and his landlord was a real dick. he would complain about non-existent noises, he jacked up the rent via some slimy loophole in the contract, he refused to make any repairs and left my friend to call plumbers, etc. on his own. at lot more stuff that i can't remember. the final straw was when my friend announced he was moving out. he gave about two months' notice, but the landlord screamed bloody murder about this and that (i don't really know), but bottom like he flat out announced that my friend would never get his security deposit back. my friend was prepared to fight this, but then said fuck it; a plan of revenge is worth a few hundred bucks. by lucky chance for this plan, the move out was at the end of august--the middle of summer. there was a closet in the apartment that he cleaned out completely. it was fairly large with hardwood floors like the rest of the apartment. then he went down to a butcher's shop and asked for the offal--basically intestines and scrap--they were going to throw away. he came back with a trash bag full of pig stomach, intestines, fat, bones, and god knows what else. he went back a few more times and got even more bags. he put all this offal in these big hefty bags and put them in the closet. he then closed the closet door and taped it all to hell--it was hermetically sealed, no air in or out. fast forward two months. it was time to go, he was moving out, he had all his stuff out, all that was left to do was leave the keys on the counter and go. which he did. but the *very* last thing he did was put on some rubber gloves, rubber boots, and a facemask and unseal the closet door. working as quickly as he could, all within a few large breaths, he took a knife and cut cut cut all those hefty bags with the two month old offal festering in there. he said even holding his breath and breathing through his mouth the stench was unbelievable. he dumped the contents on the floor, closed the closet door, and walked out. he never heard back from the landlord again. not technically an update since grandpa has been gone over 20 years now, but my grandma passed away recently and while cleaning out her house i found the newspaper clipping about the phony bomb and wanted to share it. clipping here original post here this story happened sometime between 2nd and 4th grade, so forgive a lack of details. the revenge was also a bit of happy coincidence, so it doesn't involve the plotting characteristic of the best posts on this sub, but it was one of my more satisfying revenges nonetheless. growing up, i lived in a suburb of the twin cities. there were a lot of kids in the neighborhood, and one of them, we'll call him meany pants, was a jerk-faced bully. no matter what the game was, he'd always cheat. if he ever didn't get his way, he'd hit the other kids until they cried, and then he'd lie and say other kids did it when we'd tell our parents. he'd always, *always,* steal people's toys, and then run away. looking back, he came from "that house" in the neighborhood: lawn all fucked up, christmas lights up all year, never participated in the luminaria thing at christmas, etc. i'm sure the house was shitty because his parents were deadbeats, which is probably why he was such a butt-head, but i digress. right across the street from my house, there was an ice rink where kids could skate during the winter. it was summer at the time, and we were all playing around climbing back and forth over the hockey rink fence thing. right as this girl was climbing over, meany pants grabs her shoe and pushes up so she falls. she starts crying, so my brother and i yell at meany pants and tell him that he can't play with us anymore because he's a stinky head. this doesn't sit well, and meany pants picks up a big piece of glass and starts chasing me around with it, telling me he's going to stab me. i vividly remember this incident, and can honestly say it was my first experience with terror. i was seriously afraid this crazy-ass kid was going to stab me. meany pants was my age, older than my brother, so my brother, in his infinite wisdom, kept his distance, and pelted meany pants with rocks until meany pants got sick of not catching me, and getting hit with rocks, and gave up. cut to winter time. my brother and i are at the ice rink skating. hoping we've forgotten the attempted murder, and will be willing to let him play with us, meany pants comes up and asks what we're doing. we tell him to go away because he's mean. he says something along the lines of, "fine! i only came here to use the bathroom anyway!" he goes into the port-o-potty they had set up for the skaters, and locks the door behind him. the port-o-potty is hard up against the berm where they put all the snow that they plow off of the parking lot of the park where the ice rink is, so we run over, plant our feet on the berm, and push on the back of the port-o-potty as hard as we can. it tips over, and we hear a scream punctuated by a splash. we run away, and end up getting totally busted by our mom because we come in the house laughing hysterically and won't tell her why. she marched us back across the street to help her roll the port-o-potty so the door could open. when he crawls out, meany pants is pretty-much covered in blue stuff, and my brother and i can't even laugh because he just looks so miserable and pathetic. my mom's yelling at us and telling us to apologize, which we do. my mom walks meany pants home, and when she comes back she's even *more* pissed, because his parents read her the riot act. we got in *sooooooooooooo* much trouble. if i remember correctly, we were completely grounded for a month. we didn't think about it as we were running away, but it was explained to us loudly by my mother that we are idiots, and this was actually a dangerous prank, because if my mom hadn't figured out what was going on, meany pants would have froze to death. oops. **tl;dr: my brother and i turn a little shit into a shithead.** **edit:** til that "to read someone the riot act" is an inflammatory idiom and should be avoided.there was this indian guy who i shared an apartment with in college - we were all international students. he was so incredibly selfish lazy and annoying and had a ridiculously spoilt upbringing. he would borrow silverware from me without asking but instead of washing it up (because he didn't know how) he later admitted that he just threw it away. every time we planned to leave the apt. to buy groceries etc... he would always delay. we would arrange to leave at say 12pm and he would not be ready until 2pm. one time he flipped out because i just left without him. he never helped with cleaning/chores in the apartment. he preceded to tell about his life back home where his family owned a large business. he would have servants at his home doing everything for him. then he told how his parents persuaded his high school teacher to tutor him, they then bribed her to give him the answers to a test. she lost her job over it. but all he could do was joke about it and be all smug about how he wasn't really punished by the school. he also once hit a homeless man with his car in the street and instead of stopping to help he drove to a police station to tell them. the guy died and as the country is so corrupt his family managed to bribe/pay their way out of jail. he would also say how he bribed/paid his way out of speeding tickets, getting qualifications, and a ton of other shit. meanwhile his academic work at college was suffering as he was too lazy to do any work. this was the first time he had lived/studied outside of india. he had one group assignment where one guy did all his work because they didn't want a bad grade - as it was one grade for everyone. he then had one assignment where he found a online site and paid someone $300 to do the work for him - it was a really easy assignment - a 2pg paper on a business (which had all the info he needed on their website) worth 30% of his grade. i could have done it and i'm not even doing the same major. so after all the bullshit he put me through for the year we lived together and the fact he was such a spoilt asshole i decided to email his professor and tell him he cheated on the paper. his professor thanked me for telling him but said it might be difficult to prove. still they organised a meeting between him and the school. back at the apartment he told us about the meeting and asked me for advice on what to do - as i was a senior. i told him he should just admit it, it was better to be honest now than to lie as it would 'make it worse' and they may not take it as seriously if you admit it early on - this was knowing full well the school's policy was immediate expulsion for any form of plagiarism/cheating. he went to the meeting admitted it and his professor emailed me to update me saying there would still be a drawn out process, going to the president for approval, getting all necessary people involved etc... but that ultimately he would be expelled. he still stayed in college working his way through the process until he finally came to the realisation it was all over. a year of his life wasted and thousands of dollars in tuition gone down the drain. he ended up telling his parents it was group project and another member of his team did the cheating and that it was gonna be a long drawn out investigation where he wasn't sure he could prove his innocence. so he said he wanted to just cut his college experience short and come home - he didn't really need the degree anyway as he had a job lined up in the family business. so he stayed in college to the end of the semester just partying and ended up dropping out before he could be expelled. still feel bad his parents didn't know the truth and wasted all that money on his education. but at the end of the day i think he needed a lesson that he couldn't pay his way through life - not sure it sticked though. tl;dr: terrible roommate and spoilt brat cheated on a college paper. i told his professor and got him expelled.in my college days, i had to work on a group project. i had no problem at first with the girl, "jane," who was a born dictator. very pushy and took the control over the group and the project. it wasn't a problem until any idea from the group was turned down by jane and we were just sitting and listening to her. we had roles in the presentation, and everyone supposed to present as a one of the requirements in the assignment. of course every word in the presentation was jane's work. all the group agreed that jane's ideas suck, that this assignment is a failure and no one believed we can get a good grade anyway. additionally, jane seemed to take all the credit for the work done, even if we put time to create it. during our last meeting, i created a design of the product we were talking about, uploaded it and send the link from "bit.ly" to jane, which was pointing to a picture on imageshack. i remember she didn't copy the picture to power point, but she pasted the link instead. since she was the "i know the best" type of a person, and i didn't care, i just sat quite. the presentation looked very awful by the way - just text and bullet points. everyone in the group was pissed at jane, a straight a student with dictatorship tendencies. it was just horrible to work with her. since the project was only 5% of the grade, we all agreed (without jane knowing) to not come to the presentation day for the class as our revenge. just before the class started, something occurred to me. i could redirect the link... so i did. the picture which supposed to be under the link was the product in hands of a happy person (some simple photoshop work). i redirect the link to [this picture]( later, other people from the class said that jane was freaking out we weren't there, she was very nervous and said some stupid things. she had to present by herself as she was self-proclaimed leader of the group. when she opened the link in the presentation, everyone was cracking up, because she said something about happy clients. jane didn't talk to us ever again, she even removed all of us from the fb group she created. there was 30 points possible for the presentation. our group got 5 points. unfortunately, i got b+ in the class and if we'd got at least 13 points, which we would if we'd showed up, i would have a-. luckily, jane got a-, which if we'd showed up, wouldn't lower her grade and she'd have an a. overall a good tradeoff and everyone in the group agreed on that. *** tl;dr^(a female student/dictator gets punished by her group, embarrasses herself in front of all the class, and gets lowered grade, which is the end of the world for her.)i was on the subway today and these two really bitchy girls and one asshole jock got on and sat down next to me. one girl looked over at my shoes and said "thats the new generation of ugly." i wasn't sure if she actually was talking about my shoes because she was talking to the other girl and so they talked about my shoes for about two minutes until they specifically mentioned the brand (merrells) by name, then i was positive they were talking about my shoes. the were not even trying to hide it!! they kept bending over to look at my shoes!! now i am not a vengeful person but then i realize that they are talking about bullying people. im not even joking i am pretty positive one said "i bully her everyday, its really fun!!" so i decide that i need to do something, i realize that the girl sitting next to me was wearing white jeans and that i had a black pen in my pocket. i take the pen out and unscrew the top discreetly. i let the ink flow onto her pant and she does not noticed, so i wait for my stop. when we get there i get up turn to them and say " nice pants, they match my shoes" (my shoes are black). she looked down and the look of helplessness and horror on her face was priceless, but i'm not done yet!! as i walk out i shout "slu-u-t" and the guy gets up and runs at me in an attempt to punch me. but, and i kid you not, the train doors close so that he ends up punching the metal doors. he screams like a little girl!!!!!!!! i wave sarcastically as the train moves on and i think one of the girls started crying, but i felt really good. sorry for the long post.several years back i began to receive the scam emails from nigeria. i'm sure you are familiar with these so i won't go into a great explanation. normally, i can just ignore them, but these were coming to an email pertaining to a domain that i owned for my computer repair business. it started with a few, and then grew to about 20 per day - every single day. it was irritating to get an email notification only to find out that it was one of these bs emails. i thought...what to do, what to do...then i had an idea. i went to angelfire and created a free website with nothing more than a counter on it. i shelled out to a command prompt and wrote a batch file that when executed erased boot.ini, nrldr, ntdetect.com then launched a browser which loaded the website i had created (i put a pause in it, silently recursing the windows directory just to make sure their pc made it to the website) then it would shut down the pc. for those of you not in the 'know', this will prevent a computer from booting, stopping at a black screen displaying an error message. a good tech could have it back up and going with not much issue, but i was betting against that - after all, this is nigeria. i packaged the file into a password protected zip file and emailed it back to a few scammers stating that 'this was given to me by the bank, and contains my banking and credit card information. it is set to give a false virus warning to stop scammers, the password for the first file is &lt;password&gt;. please do not steal my information, i trust you'. within 2 days, the counter on my website had went from 3 (where i tested it) to over 140. i have yet to receive another email from scammers at this email address. from what i understand, they hack each others email in hopes of stealing 'victims' from each other. i hope that the down-time i forced upon them was enough to allow for at least a few people to be educated about this scam.  i don't know i can call this revenge, but it sure felt good. one day i'm driving home. it's about 430 in the afternoon so there are a decent amount of people on the road. this particular street i'm driving on is mostly two lanes, but there's a three block section where it widens to three lanes. as i'm approaching this section, i notice a large truck in the front spot in my current lane(middle). the third lane is open, so i change lanes to the right, signaling. i pass the line of cars and aforementioned truck, signal left and get over with two blocks to spare. as i'm coming up to where these two lanes merge, i see a kia sorento flying up behind me in the now nonexistent third lane. he passes me and cuts me off without using his blinker, puffing on a cigarette. i drive a decent little car with ample power, so naturally i seize an opportunity to change lanes left, pass him, get over, fly the bird out the window, and still make my turn. i turn right and he follows me. i can tell he's trying desperately to ride my ass and match my speed. this particular turn is quite difficult because it has some sharp corners that lead into each other. i'm fully focused on maintaining my 50mph around these corners. nailed it. i'm on the straightaway. i simultaneously look in my rear-view to check on shithead and hear my gf gasp. he's spinning out of control incredibly violently. he spins that little kia two and a half rotations before screeching to a halt in a cloud of dust. mind you i still haven't looked forward because this road is extremely straight. i stick my arm out the window and fly him one last triumphant middle finger. i then look back at the road just in time to see a cop go by me towards the cloud of dust which housed said kia, flip his lights on and pull the guy over. happiest road rage experience of my life.i was recently fired as a trainee bus driver after clipping a tree with a side mirror pulling into a bus stop. this is something even experienced drivers do, which were my bosses exact words. two days later i was told i was being let go because of my unsafe approach to bus stops as evidenced by the mirror incident, and that the company "wasn't a training organisation, and didn't have the resources to waste training me" (even though i was explicitly hired as a trainee). so, the company i worked for is a subcontractor to the local city councils and school services, and provides contract based fill-in type work. since being fired, between looking for new jobs, i've been posting complaints to the coordinating body that manages all the little bus companies in the region. about the state of the busses uncleanliness, unsafe traffic behaviour, rude and surly drivers, and similar. just found out my former company missed out on 7 new school contracts and has not had 3 route service contracts renewed for the new year. the operations manager who fired me has not had *his* contract renewed for failing to maintain the standards of service and the spike in customer complaints. spiteful? you bet! lesson for next time; it's better to have me inside pissing out, rather than outside pissing in.edit: i was really fucking drunk when i wrote this so it's time for the remastered edition!! when i was in college and my sister moira was still in 10th grade, there was this little bitch named victoria who bullied her. everyday she would call me about how much she hates the school, and this really started to piss me off. one day skipped a class, drove to the highschool to pick my sister up earlier than usual, (whatever, i had like a fucking 150) and looked for the victoria. moira ran to me to pick her up, but instead of opening the door i asked her where the girl was. she told me not to get physical, as i had a history of getting hotheaded in similar situations. not this time, i told her. she pointed victoria out and i slowly drove next to her. *uh huh this my shit all the girls stomp your feet like this* the song bursted from my car and it made absolutely no sense at the time, but i had a plan. she just looked confused as i slowly drove next to her as if i were picking her up. the next day, victoria was leaving the school and as she was walking to her car: *uh uh this my shit all the girls stomp your feet like this* the look on her face was priceless, she was just speechless, which was hilarious with the little danananananananas playing in the background for a while. eventually this became a trend. kids would gather around to see if i was going to play the song, and moira told me that people were starting to make fun of the victoria for it. i had no idea why the song hollaback girl by gwen stefani was getting to her so much, but hey, whatever works. every day for the two weeks i would pop in that copy of *love angel music baby* and play that song. every time she would run to her car. eventually one day my sister told me victoria had stopped bullying her, and from that day i stopped coming to the school. ~~plus, the teachers sent me an email about how i wasn't acting like an adult and how if i agreed to stop coming to the school like an asshole they would crack down on the bullying.~~ i feel like this is a long story. tldr at the end. a few years ago my ex and i lived with my mom. directly next door to my mom lived a kindly old lady and her great-grandson (about 15; we'll call him caleb). we shared a back yard. according to relatives and other neighbors, this kid was trouble. once, caleb took a pack of cigarettes from our vehicle (no idea how, as we kept it locked) and shot them up with a bb gun, leaving the mess right in our driveway. the list of asshole moves he pulled goes on and on. but that's not why i'm telling this tale. he had this bike he rode all day, every chance he could, up and down the street with some other boys. on more than one occasion he left this bike in our driveway behind our vehicles. each time we put it in his yard, out of harm's way. well, one day the bike goes missing. we have no idea how or why, but caleb thought we took it, i suppose. one day my ex was taking the dog outside to use the bathroom and she ran into caleb's side of the yard and into the bushes. before my ex could get over there, she was mysteriously gone. we spent hours looking for this dog. while we were doing this, we see caleb outside with his friends, laughing about something and staring at us. ex and i go over to ask if they've seen the dog and they say no, but offer to look with us. they were looking, but not really "looking". it was all really fishy. when we parted ways, they sarcastically said "good luck finding your dog!" and laughed. days went by, we thought she was dead. but after a while one of the kids from caleb's group of friends brings the dog to caleb's great-grandmother's house. dog is back, yay. we pretty much figured caleb took her because of the searching incident and the fact that every time the dog saw caleb she would howl and run inside. the poor thing was traumatized and wasn't the same for months. even if he didn't take her, he was a shit in many other ways and deserved what he got. while all this was going on, the bike was in our yard again, right behind the car. i guess caleb got it back. one night, ex and i decided we'd had enough and caleb needed to pay for hurting our dog. armed with the biggest knives we had along with some spray paint, we doctored up the bike. slashed the tires, spray painted it pink, and scratched "dog-napper" into the metal. we went far into the woods behind an abandoned house on our street and tossed the bike into a giant thorn bush. caleb didn't mess with us again. tldr: asshole teenage neighbor kidnaps and traumatizes our dog, we fuck up his beloved bike and leave it in the woods edit: wow, thanks for the gold! i didn't think people would actually read this. to clear some things up: -we didn't do anything directly to him because ex and i were weenies and feared the law (caleb was 15, we were 18/19) -we feel bike revenge was the best way to go because he loved that bike -he doesn't live next door any more; this story took place in late 2011so this summer we decided to cram ourselves into a car ( which we ended up sleeping in after the bars for sake of being to drunk to drive anywhere) and drive down to canada's big apple ( toronto ). our entire endeavor was to go to a young up and coming edm festival called veld. now i want everyone to remember were in canada, the land of thank you's and push overs. there was about 30 000 people at this outdoor festival in the middle of downsview park .. sunnt.. beautiful scenery, beautiful people, and fucking awesome music. at the begging of dada life's set, these girls decide they are not only going to be rude to to 15000 people behind them, but they are also going to make the evergrowing garbage problem even worse by taking 4 garbage cans.. dumping them out on the ground.. and proceding to stand on them in the middle of a massive crowd. now that really was not that big of an issue to me. i wasn't really paying attention to them at all, but my boyfriend keeps telling me how thier pushing people off who are trying to join them on top of the barrels. i go over and ask politely if i can maybe get up on top of the barrels with them ( there is one free barrel) and the girl looks at me and laughs me away saying no there isn't room and there will not be any room. kind of taken aback, i walk away disappointed. i start watching them more closely and there was one or two people that managed to get themselves on top of the barrels too, only to be immediately pushed back off an laughed at by these girls. my boyfriend has had enough of their snotty attitude in a public place where everybody paid the same amount to be there, he collects a few extremely willing people from around us and plots his revenge. the helping by standers happened to consist of another angry boyfriend, two people who had been pushed, and 3 people who were just annoyed to high heavens with these girls. they all huddled together waiting for the next drop in the song to come. as it builds up and drops all 6 of them kick the tops of the barrels making all the girls plummet to a horrible embarrassment that they brought upon themselves. they stand up and turn around for help or for someone to rat us out... everybody kind of just laughed and cleared away without asking if they were ok or anything. sweet sweet revenge. we do have a video of it here if anyones interested : original post [here]( added some additional details that i had replied to in the comments in original post. reddit, i am not proud of what i did, and i do feel that karma will get me one day- i am prepared for it. i am embarrassed that a somewhat successful individual such as myself is capable of something so childish and embarrassing (i'm 26). i'll try to make this short. **background:** me and my ex had been together for about 1 year- long distance relationship (he lived about 3 hours away). i find out from his sister that he was talking to other women when we were still together and confrontations with him lead nowhere with him saying that i am the only one on his mind and that he would never do that to me (the usual spiel) and that his sister does not know what she is talking about. i take his side (because i loved him). **3 weeks ago,** i find out from a mutual friend that he has been seeing and sleeping with this girl in his town, i confront him about it and he flips everything around on me, saying that its so hard for him to keep his dick in his pants while i am living so far away, that i neglect him (which i don't, i am the one that drives to see him every other weekend when i have the funds, we call, text, skype each other daily), that i don't want him to live with me (which is true because i don't want to take care of a grown ass man and pay his bills). he says he loves me and wants to make it work and drops all contact the next day. i was heartbroken, i talked to my friends and they said the girl he is hooking up with is an easy slut that has been around and that they are in a relationship the day after me and the ex had the talk- probably even before then. **2 weeks ago,** while still hurting, heartbroken, i reactivated my facebook and meticulously combed through my ex and his new "love's" profiles. i know i should not have done this but whatever. i did not dwell on their flirty messages but instead, focused on her profile. i read through months of disgusting selfies of her in a dirty dark bathroom with barely there clothes that even a floozy would be embarrassed of being caught in. then i did it. i made a fake facebook profile of a fine-ass looking man from google that "used to go to her school." i befriended all of her friends, made fake posts and befriended her. all of this took less than a day. you would be surprised at how many people would befriend you on facebook just from your looks regardless of if they know you or not. i had about 140 "friends" in just 2 hours and at that point, people were requesting to be my friend every few minutes. i dunno who is more pathetic, me or these weirdos (just me probably). i started to chat her up the next day, she was very "open" with herself, even sending me new pictures of herself in little clothing to a complete stranger without any in return. being a woman myself, it was easy to tell her what she wanted to hear. 2-3 days later, she was complaining about my ex to me already. i told her i wanted to meet up and will pick her up and "show her what its like to be with a real man." at this point, i had hours of conversations saved, her saying the dirtiest shit that i've ever read - pictures, videos, what have you. it was time. while all this was going on, my ex started to contact me, saying it was a mistake. i asked him if they had broken up, he says yes (twice) and they were not obviously. this should have broken my heart but it didnt. i knew the truth but told him that yes i love him and that i want him to move in with me. he sounded happy, excited- whatever and said that he was going to give his 2 weeks to his boss that day. he texted me later and told me that he just left them with no notice instead because, "fuck em." he was going to start packing and will head out with everything later in the week. **the revenge.** i posted all of the conversations up on fake facebook, tagged her in it posted the pictures and videos for my ex's eyes only and sat back and enjoyed the show, before i deactivated the fake acc, i had 53 likes and 82 messages. her family, friends all saw it. my ex saw it and almost immediately texted me to say how he misses me, he can't wait to be with me and doesn't mention anything about the girl. friday rolls around and he tells me he is on his way to my apt. he does not know where i live because i recently moved. i tell him to meet me at a cvs close by so i direct him on where to go. he tells me he is almost out of gas and that i will have to help him put some in it. i agree and tell him that i will once he gets there. i get a text telling me he's at the cvs and asks where i am. i ignore it. 30 minutes later, he blows up my phone. calls ignored- i made it a point to let it ring once so that he knows i send it to voicemail. 1 hour later- he calls and leaves me a voicemail that he is worried and if i am ok. i am fan-fucking-tastic. 2 hours later, he says that he is stranded, drove to another cvs thinking i was there but now he has no gas and is stranded at a gas station with his things in the car. calls ignored. i take an ambien and go to bed. saturday morning. i have 37 text messages 28 missed calls and 7 voicemails from him and that he had to call his mom to come pick him up. since then, i blocked his number and then had to change my number since he would then start calling me from his family's phone and blocked calls. i get a msg on fb from his sister. she tells me he came home crying like a fucking baby and since his mom knows pretty much what happened between me and him, she was not very sympathetic- but pretty upset with me. his sister thought i was a badass and deserved better than his lying, cheating loser of a brother. i know i acted on impulse on all of this, probably destroyed this girls life. i will probably reactivate fake profile to say sorry or whatever but maybe not. she did knowingly sleep with a man that had a girlfriend- seduced him even. i know this sounds crazy but the feelings i had for my ex are still there. he will never forgive me since he is now unemployed and the whole town knows his business (the girl admitted his dick is tiny). part of me regrets everything and that i want him back with me. other part of me is glad i destroyed any type of reconciliation as it was not going to work out in the end. feels good to let this out. **tldr: bf cheated, created fake facebook to lure new gf- worked. seemingly reconciled with ex but then left him stranded 3 hours away from home.** **additional bits of info i copied from comment replies:** he was a friend for 2 years before asking me to be his gf. i left a lot of details out, such as helping him financially with the car he has as well as food for him and his family because they wouldn't have had anything to eat otherwise. i stuck by this guy through his worst times, the lowest point he was ever in. and he screws around on me with the slut of the town and lies about it many times. contacts me and gives me false hope and then disappears suddenly without an explanation so he can stick his dick in a dirty whore. i'm rambling. she doesn't know it was me, just a random dude that put her shit on blast. i made a point not to share the pictures- only to my ex and even those were sent from fake facebook with face blurred out. the tasteless tats were there though so he knows its her. nobody has connected the dots yet. i tried to be careful about this. i lost him- yes but i don't want him back. i have also booked a gyno appointment thanks to him.i've been in a long distance relationship with a cat for 3 years. the feline in question, poof, belongs to my boyfriend's roommate - "ned". ned is a [douchebag]( really. just with less blow-out-hair than the referenced image, and more crappy tribal tattoos. ned was hired right out of college as a firefighter, and loves leaving his t4 slips around - showing that he makes over 100k a year. yet despite working 7 days a week (granted, 24h shifts) he fails to give proper care to his dog and cat. he'll do things like leave the dog in it's crate for 16+ hours a day, run out of food for the animals then claim they're on diets, hardly walk his dog to the point where it's socially dysfunctional and has overgrown nails. when my boyfriend and i are at the house he shares with ned, we do the best we can to take care of the pets. any attempt to discuss their neglect is blown off by ned. over the years, poof and i have become very attached. i take him to the vet, get him groomed, buy him food. the only reason i haven't adopted him is because i'm away from home so much. ned told my boyfriend he needed to move out for june 1st. totally fine. ned is just as horrible a roommate as he is a human - but bf has stuck around because rent was cheap &amp; the house was nice. he'd been planning on buying a house - so getting the boot from ned's place put that plan into motion. i'm not going to leave poof with ned, so i ask him one night if i could buy the cat from him. (he'd often bragged about how the cat was a 'good deal' at $50) ned, who loves his possessions, was unsure and said he'd get back to me. next day, he says i can have poof... for $350. i cry. i've paid way more than that in food, vet bills and medication for this creature. i was laid off and have been underemployed so i'm not really in the position to drop that much money on someone who's emotionally already my pet. *fast forward three months.* this weekend, i'm back at ned's house - helping my partner pack. i haven't been back to the house since ned's absurd offer of $350 a 9 year old cat with kidney issues. as we're almost done, ned comes up and says poof has died. or, at least, he can't find poof so he figures he got out the house and died outside. he shrugs it off. happened about a month ago. once again, i weep. i let loose my years of fury on ned. telling him how i feel about his constant drunk driving, abusing women, pathological lying, animal neglect, and horrible narcissistic personality. my partner and i get into the rented truck, and drive to his new house. open the front door and i'm greeted by my beloved poof - mewing for attention. fuck you, ned. two weeks after he said i'd have to buy my geriatric cat from him, i came over during the week and took poof. i wonder how long it look that douchebag to notice poof was gone. ned frequently comes home and passes out with the front door wide open - so the cat running away was absurdly plausible. now poof, myself and my boyfriend have a little house, where poof can sit on the windowsill and be a happy, heavily loved fluffball. i've also reported ned for animal cruelty for his dog. wanted to kidnap the little mutt as well, but it wasn't possible. **tl;dr** rule number one: don't be a douchebag. here's [my fluffy love monster]( sitting like a gentleman on a car ride.  ______________________________________________ do remember to read the whole article guys! it would be great if you could comment on the quality which could help me become better! :) and dont forget to check out the other subs which have been featured! :d p.s: dont forget to upvote your feature at /r/subredditoftheday!long time fan, first-time poster, yadda, yadda. we're going back to the early 70´s for this one. lots of folks serving to stay out of nam or jail. very poor esprit de corp, bad racial tension, just general all-around bad ju-ju. four of us 20 somethings (3 white, 1 black) worked in a very technical niche speciality now the job of highly paid contractors. our shop spaces, located aft on an upper deck, included a then high end paint booth. after hours it was the perfect 420 spot because of the highly filtered exhaust system. we could securely dog (lock) the hatch, smoke our selves mellow, and the fans took care of smoke, ash, even roaches in emergencies. that thing really sucked, in a good way. like fleet followers. finished up before evening chow, popped out, red-eyed in a fit of chuckling only to bump into the chief petty officer henceforth known as red neck bigot (rnb). this asshole was loathed by every e-7 and below aboard and nearly all the rest excepting his ass kissing pal, the master at arms and our bitter, loathsome executive officer. rnb ´s douchebaggery had previously included but was not limited to instances of bogus charges resulting in confinement with bread &amp; water, loss of pay &amp; rank, restriction to the ship, extra duty, just to name a few. his incompetence often put men needlessly in danger of serious injury or worse. thankfully the cpo we worked for was an awesome shipmate and we didn't have to deal with rnb often. well, he's up in our country looking for our boss when he sees 4 young guys (racially mixed, oh my!) way too happy pop out of an empty paint room. obviously up to no good. must be hippie homos! from that point on he made it his mission to fuck with the four of us at every opportunity. he would "borrow" us for special details whenever he could. deck repair in the hot sun? check. clean grease from galley vents? check. clean rotted food from broken reefers? check. stand the worst watches. snap inspections. the petty punishments went on and on. as did his obvious enjoyment. one day he went too far. three of us were assigned to help clean the nuclear hold &amp; bilges. a job for which we had no training. no knowledge of protocols. and to top it off, he tried to send us below without the proper safety gear. thank the fsm that the officer in charge was having none of that shit. we could have been seriously fucked, put the ship, hell, the whole port in serious peril. one of the gang got the idea while stuck putting a fresh coat of paint in the master at arms office. (thanks, again, rnb) he was able to overhear plans for the ship's first ever drug dog sweep. we wait until the day before the sweep. herb back then was cheap, plentiful and often seedy. take the seeds up to the chiefs berthing, crush them against his locker door and rub vigorously. same for his rack. brick of shitty weed we'd been burned with? under the front seat of his ´69 mustang next to a box of baggies and a small scale. sit back and wait. payback is a motherfucker. didn't get to see it but we heard the dog went nuts on his locker and bunk. thorough search reveals nothing but suspicions are aroused. enough so that his car was searched. with our intended result. he was taken away in handcuffs, beet-red and crying. never to be seen again. we later heard that rnb got a bcd and time in leavenworth. should've picked on somebody else, chief.this happened to a very good friend of mine (let's call him "vgf"), and i've just recently stumbled upon this reddit. so now i want to share the story of him and this one indian-american (this detail will be important later) douchebag (let's call him "db") from our high school days, who "stole" his girlfriend. the girl isn't faultless in this story, but even in high school, we knew db was crushing hard on her. vgf wanted to jump him, but she always said no, that she'd handle it herself. he trusted her, and let it be. in time, vgf went to college near his girlfriend, but not at the same school. unfortunately, db also attended her college, and by our sophomore year, she broke up with vgf, and started dating db that same week. vgf was pretty crushed, and it messed him up for years. bewilderingly, db immediately started taunting vgf about now having his girl, and so began an escalating revenge war. the first time was at a bar, where i was present, and db came up to our table all chummy-chummy. after we told him to piss off, db retorted with a sneer, "fine. i'll tell 'susan' (the girlfriend) you cunts said hi. later. tonight," while putting up two fingers and flicking his tongue. vgf turned in his seat, and then shot back, "sure. do that. and while you're at it, tell me later how i taste." i bought my brass-balled buddy all his beers that night. later on, vgf told me that db had sent three guys after him after his shift ended at the local strip mall. vgf was a black belt in karate, and the guys were just some thugs. vgf took some punches, and had to fill out a police report, but it was all recorded on mall security cameras that they threw the first punch. no sweat. the incidents continued over two years, slowly escalating. finally, it culminated with db keying up vgf's car (we have no evidence it was him, but vgf lived literally two blocks from susan, and the three of them saw each other regularly whenever db went to pick her up). that was the final straw, and it took hundreds of dollars to fix the damage. now, vgf was pretty handy as a designer (this was before photoshop), and our town was full of minority families. there's a fairly strong italian population, but the rest are mostly latino-- mexican, el salvadoran, primarily-- and also indian and orthodox jewish. so, he got it in his head to make a white supremacy flyer, and print up about a hundred copies. printed at the bottom was some made-up organization, with db's phone number. he went off on a week-long family vacation, and got his fraternity brothers to leave the flyers on car windshields at a supermarket parking lot, one busy sunday. no one got to see db's reaction, but vgf neither heard nor got any trouble from db again, after that. edit: wordsi used to see this girl who travelled a lot, she'd come to my county a few times a year and i'd go to hers once or twice a year. the last time she was over we were having a few drinks with these guys i just met in a bar. she got quite drunk and when she was downstairs going to the toilet she bumped into one of the guys we just met and they hit it off. she took him into the toilet where they kissed and 'started a blowjob' but stopped before it finished (like it mattered). they both came back to the table, separately, and continued having a laugh with me (hindsight shows they were laughing at me). when we got home (girl and me) she confessed what happened. since it was late i told her she could sleep in my spare room and i then kicked her out in the morning and haven't seen her since. the guy, on the other hand, i hadn't finished with. unbeknownst to him his friend had given me his card (he thought he was quite the businessman) and through his facebook i found the guy and he had his website and email on his public facebook (again, quite the businessman). i made a new gmail and facebook account which was the girl’s first name plus a common surname and emailed him along the lines, "hey, i got your email address from your friend’s card, i feel we had a connection and would like to see you when i'm back in a few weeks. we emailed back and forth with me providing some photos i had of her as proof and he agreed to take a couple of days off work and drive 300km to the rendezvous hotel. as he would have been driving down i sent his girlfriend (proudly listed on his public fb page) a facebook message, from newly created girls account, that said, "hi, i'm sorry to contact you but are you 'his' girlfriend?" she replied, "yes, who the fuck are you?" i (she) explained how we met and what we did and that i was about to meet her boyfriend at a hotel. i told her now that i found out he has a girlfriend i feel sick. i give her the hotel phone number and his room number and tell her to ring saying it's my name and see what happens. i also explained about the guy i was with (me) and that she should ring him to get some revenge sex. now i'd like to say she contacted me (she looked hot in her profile) and sex was had, but that was the last i heard from them.okay, this isn't a story about me, but instead, my closest friend (jjb) of all time. i've known jjb for well over 20 years ever since we were in elementary together. he's redneck-y, racist, short-tempered, and he really just doesn't give a shit about getting into trouble, unless it means going to jail. all in all, he's a great friend; just stupid and makes many, many mistakes that involve me/us almost getting into fights or getting thrown out of a place due to drunken racial fueled rants of his. but to my story, he has horrible taste in women. they all are just like him but worse. drug using, neo-nazi tattooed, binge drinking chicks that would make the wild and wonderful whites give them hugs. jjb's ex from about two years ago broke up with him and wanted to move out saying that she was moving back to her mother's. but come to find out she was moving in with a guy she was dating on the side 3 days after their breakup. jjb finds out, goes straight to a bar to drown his sorrows; then drives home. on his way home he passed by a roadkilled deer that was lying there from the day before, and being as redneck as he is, he threw it into the bed of his truck so he could keep the head and antlers (when it became a skull) as decoration for his house. that's normal for him, trust me. -skip forward to about 7am- he calls me and tells me to come over because it's urgent. i go over and see the bed of his truck just covered in blood and hair with an ax and saw inside. i fucking freak out and about to call the cops thinking he just murdered his ex or something, but he stops me in time and told me it was from a deer, then shows me the head on the side of his house. we go inside, it smells fucking amazing inside his house, like thanksgiving good. i see a pot on the stove and asked him what he was cooking, jjb then guided me to the back door and pointed out towards a pile of rotting, fly infested, bone poking through the skin, gutted, and bloody headless corpse of the deer... and says, "that." i almost fucking hurled. he stayed up all night looking up chili recipes to make the perfect kind from deer meat. then cooked it to give to his ex and her new boyfriend as a "no hard feeling, amirite guys?" kind of gift. admittedly, it smelled and looked delicious. but neither of us tried it. later that day, jjb goes to his ex's new house (after washing his truck) and gives them the chili, then tells them to just "go ahead and keep the pot, too". so this story takes place around early 2013, i was walking around the city with my friends (some of which are hooligans, as we teens are wont to be) and we walked past a planned parenthood clinic with all the fundies in front of it with their dead foetus signs and jeering, so one of my friends flipped them off. that would have been the end of the story but unfortunately for me i had to bike past the church they came from to get to school every morning, and one of them recognized me. i cycled away as they jeered and yelled the usual "burn in hell sinner!" and went to school. i got tired of this of course, it was a rather unlovely way to start my day. i started going to the church, learning how to get back at them for making my mornings annoying, i told them that i repented, i told them my friend wasn't a friend but just a guy that one of my friends knew and of course i wasn't friends with a sinner like that. i learned that the pastor used lots of youtube videos and lots of online presentations to preach, that the church had been remodeled a lot and had lots of power outlets in corners of cabinets and such, and finally that it had an open wifi network. i had a friend that had an old phone that he wanted rooted, i rooted it for him in exchange for being able to borrow it for a month, i rooted the phone and installed three apps, a remote access tool that let me control the phone from my computer, a wifi organization tool, i walked around the neighborhood where the church was and let it sniff all the open networks, and told it to connect to either the church's wifi or any new open wifi (in case the played with the router) and the crown jewel, a dns spoofer i set up to redirect, at random, all web pages to either, rick astley, lol limewire, michael jackson grunts, or old greg, and pause for 30 seconds every five minutes so i could control it if i wanted to. i took this phone to the church with a charger, found a cupboard with an outlet in it that looked like it wasn't used often, and set it up. at the sermon the pastor gave his usual ra ra speech before trying to open a prezi, and it redirecting to michael jackson grunting a lot, he refreshed the page, old greg, again, rickrolled, again, yar har, i had to go to the bathroom and laugh because they were so confused, i left it there for a month, occasionally adding new pages just to freshen it up, they were incredibly confused and upset. i took it back and returned it to my friend, and never went to that church again and changed my biking route so they wouldn't yell at me. tl;dr angry fundies got mad at me and yelled at me on my way to school so i trolled them big time.ok so this story belongs to /u/rubyrhod and can be read [in this link]( however, i'll copy it in here because of the rules. here it goes: &gt; when a kid is being a brat in a noisy and public area, i casually get close to them and fart on their head/face. i'm really tall so it's usually a direct hit. &gt; &gt; it's funniest when the kid notices and doesn't know what to do because i'm a fucking giant and i'll eat them if they tell their mommy. &gt; &gt; if i decide to stare it's usually with a, "yeah, what the fuck are you gonna do about it?" look. &gt; &gt; i'm about 6'7'' so even when i'm just trying to be friendly (i.e. not farting on a stanger kid's head) and meeting a family member's or friend's kid for the first time, i've noticed they get very 'hide between their mother's legs' intimidated on sight if i'm not sitting down. so it's not hard for me to silence/intimidate a child, especially when i'm trying to. &gt; &gt; however, a few times i've been called out. one time i was pretty drunk with a friend at a target buying risk (and no, we never finished playing the whole game). this little mexican 5-7 year old with a mohawk, was being an insufferable little shit in the action figure section. i heard him from like 5 aisles over and it was like nails on a chalkboard. i tell my friend, "i'm gonna fart on this kids head. watch and learn." &gt; &gt; i saunter on over to the aisle in question and see the vile little prick calling his mom an "idiot" for not buying him a huge fucking g.i. joe the movie vehicle (which pissed me off even more considering how awful that movie was. buy some good toys!) "i already bought that one for you and you broke it by throwing it down the stairs" "shut up. i need it. it's the only one i don't have now." the mother was younger than me (i'm mid twenties) and gave a defeated look, "i don't have enough money right now." "you are an idiot," and continued to just berate and publicly shame this woman. &gt; &gt; at the time, i was on a strict chipotle carnitas burrito diet. and while i was watching all this, my stomach gave me an initial warning gurgle (very courteous stomach) telling me i was about an hour away from punishing the toilet. serendipity! destiny! &gt; &gt; i inch a bit closer to my prey, inspecting some wrestling toys and pondering the weird homoeroticness of the whole 'sport' in general. the kid shouts "fuck you, i hate you!" the mom rolls her eyes and turns her back to the kid to ignore him. and could you believe it, the kid gets on his hands and knees and starts taking the toy out of the box. it's go time, motherfucker. &gt; &gt; i position my back towards him and at this point am like 2 feet away from him. his head is down, getting frustrated with those god damn twisty tie things, and i go for the kill. i bend down to reach for the one of the toys on the lower shelf. at this point, my ass is inches away from this kids head. &gt; &gt; now, generally speaking, the best way to go about this is to act casual, drop your belly bomb, then walk away after a few seconds like nothing is out of the ordinary. i usually go one aisle over and listen to the kid's reaction in delight. however, today i couldn't help myself. i have my head tilted back looking at this kid out of the corner of my eye, to ensure accuracy. &gt; &gt; i'm so close that from a distance it looks like i'm about to sit on him,. my friend sees this happening and can no longer contain himself. he's covering his mouth, but his 'hee-haw' hyperventilating donkey chortle is fairly audible over the late 90's pop muzak playing on the loudspeakers. &gt; &gt; the kid immediately looks up towards the laughter, but can't help but notice there is an ass now directly in his face. now, i'm trying not to laugh but also panicking as i just made eye contact with him. he furls his brow and i look over in the mother's direction, still back towards us. i relish in the moment and the look on this child's confused and naive face. &gt; &gt; the initial blast was mighty and boisterous. i swear i saw his hair blowing in the wind (so to speak). if i wasn't wearing jeans, i think it could have probably blown over an empty soda can. i would call it "a very fun fart" (a++ would buy again). however, what immediately followed that out the chamber was truly horrifying. the fart's implication changed without notice and swiftly. it went from a joyous, dry airhorn squeal to a nefarious, hissing mephitis. i think the little moppet noticed the hateful metamorphosis before even i did because he wretched his neck violently trying to get away from the personified evil being fumigated into his soul. because of his positioning (hovering over the toy, hands and knee), it was all in vain as the only way out was forward...and forward would mean certain death. i had positioned myself well on the higher ground, free to escape or relent at any time and him, poor and immobilized: biding his time until the cruel attack was over. obviously, this child needed to re-read sun tzu. &gt; in total, it lasted about 4 seconds but for that kid, it must have seemed like time was frozen. the long-term severe brain damage which he no doubt suffered, only added to that effect. &gt; when i finished with my bidness (i.e. forcing a little boy to huff my farts), there was a silent, pregnant pause. the kid was clearly shocked and stunned. no one had ever stood up to this dwarf sociopath in his whole life. i had taken the words out of his mouth and filled it with fart. &gt; &gt; i make my move first, picking up the toy i was "reaching for" off the low shelf, take a few steps forward and stare at it for a few seconds. on '2 alligator,' the only thing the kid could manage to do was burst into tears. my friend senses danger 'the jig is up' and his head darts for cover. the mom turns around to see her kid with an open toy, crying on the floor and me minding my own business. &gt; she walks up to him and asks what's wrong but the kid can't speak. all he gets out is, "bawawaaawafartbawawa." it took every fiber in my body not to laugh. i put the toy back on a middle shelf, turn around, give a final nonchalant looksy and then begin to take my exit. &gt; sensing that his assailant was getting away scot-free, he somehow managed to compose himself for a moment. he shouts, "he farted on me!" i could feel him pointing at me but i continued to act like i was just browsing. i was almost around the corner when the mom goes: &gt; &gt; - "excuse me....sir....sir!" &gt; i turn around nonplussed, -"uh...who? me?" - while pointing to myself. &gt; - "yes. did you just fart on my son?" &gt; weighing my options, i played dumb. - "what? i mean, i did fart." &gt; - "on my son?" &gt; - "well, i mean, technically speaking...i mean...what is 'on'?" &gt; - "why did you fart on my son?" &gt; at this point the little kid has the look of schadenfreude on his face, happy to see me in trouble. fuck you, i'm a man! i will fart on you if i please! i turn my attention to the little kid and stare at him, &gt; - "because the whole store could hear him being a little, rotten asshole to his mother so i thought i'd come over here and treat him like one." &gt; &gt; the mom looks at me, her son and the scattered gi joe/wrappers/box on the floor. the mom is puzzled as to what to do and says, - "just..just go." - that's my cue! i turn around, walk away with little extra step. i look up to see the black orb of security cameras and all the stories on reddit about unjustly having to register as a sex offender flash before my eyes. as soon as i turn the corner, i book it outside as fast as i can while dialing my friend. like a true friend, he is right out front with the engine running and risk in the trunk. &gt; &gt; we laugh on the car ride back about the whole scene. with a slight hint of seriousness in his tone, my friend asks me: &gt; &gt; - "do you do that a lot?" &gt; - "ahhh, not that much. like once every 6 months or so." &gt; &gt; we both knew i was lying. we got to our other friends house, played risk until 4 in the morning while drinking scotch. overall, i would say it was a preeeetay preeeeetay good day.disclaimer: this is not my revenge story but one i thought you guys would like the story: so there is this guy who is a professional landscaper and he was contracted to do a big job for someone, the whole deal. completely reshaping the garden and basically making it look amazing (so i hear) but he had one problem, he didn't get paid... the revenge: now this guy doesnt like not getting paid (i have another story about him) so what he does is magic, after weeks of trying to get paid he had enough. he put on a boiler suit and a mask, he jumped into his van and drove to he house, went to the garden and sprayed a "kill everything" weed killer over every thing. the best part is it took 3 days for them to notice and there was nothing they could do about it...so when i was a teenager we had the dick neighbor. you know the one that to call the cops has to just hit redial. so after years of him yelling at us for playing ball to near his house, or how we needed to cut our grass shorter because it wasn't even with his and looked bad. or the party after party he had the cops show up at our house. (and not even teen drinking parties either. just normal ones my folks were having with the music set to like 7) finally i just could not take it anymore after the last thing. so its a saturday afternoon in july (2pm) my friends and i are out playing with our cars as teen age boys do (ie rebuilding a engine etc). suddenly the cops show up, we are all wtf. after talking with us asking about what we are doing. he finally says ok and heads to our neighbors house, tells the guy that at 2 oclock on a saturday afternoon is when we are suppose to be making noise and not to call again. i decided ok fuck this already. so about 3 am i sneak over his place and remove all his lug nuts. at 7 am i am woken up to a loud thunk and cursing. i look out my window see his car in the street all four tires are off the hubs and pushed up into his fenders. he still was the dick neighbor but i had a smile on my face when i saw him. and thought of the time and money i cost him.note: i'm not sure if this really belongs here so please let me know if i should move it. i apologize for the shitty grammar and formatting, it's not my strongest point and i suck at explaining things. i posted a dumbed down version of this as a comment in askreddit but i'll add more detail here. this started about 15 years ago (when i was 9), my friends and i were just a normal group of kids who enjoyed everything from playing with sticks to building monsters out of bionicle. we were harmless and stayed out of trouble. anyway, this asshole whom i shall refer to as anal, decided it was in his interests to bully us. keep in mind that i'm talking about a fully grown 40 year old man (at the time). one day we were doing our usual stuff and kicking a ball around in a mostly empty car park, only anal's car was there and we were nowhere near it. now this creep must have been watching us from his house which was about 40-50 metres away, because as soon as the ball rolled near his car, he came sprinting out like a nutjob and snatched the ball. we asked for it back and naturally he said no, so we had to get my friend's dad to get it. anal lied and told him that we were jumping on his car and kicking the ball against it so we got into trouble. this had started to happen quite often to the point of our parents doubting him but not doing anything about it because it wasn't really worth the drama and time. we eventually started to hang about with his son, fedora. fedora was pretty cool at first but he started acting like an idiot, i don't mean normal kids stuff. he would scream in your ear or spit on you thinking it was hilarious, he also had a really high pitched laugh like a damn monkey. we decided to distance ourselves from him and not bother with him but he kept coming back. now to make things worse, his dad always seemed to be watching somehow because every time fedora got injured, he would be straight out to blame and accuse us of bullying. example 1: fedora sprinted into a lamp post and knocked himself out, anal went apeshit and threatened our parents that "if we continued" he would call the police. example 2: fedora fell off his scooter in front of his dad and anal told our parents we did it. example 3: he got stuck up a lamp post and once again we got the blame. when we were 14, anal really went too far this time. we kicked our ball over his fence by accident and he was in the garden ready, he popped his head over looking all smug but luckily my friend's mother could see through the kitchen window. anal came outside ready to complain but my friend's mother was ready for it and couldn't be bothered to deal with his shit. she asked him if he could pass it back and what did he say? "fuck off you cunt". now my friend's dad had heard this, and his eyes caught fire. keep in mind that he is really well built while anal is a skinny little shit who can only talk big. anal only ended up with a black eye because he managed to scramble away and call the police, luckily nothing was really done about it because it was our words over his. time went on and he kept trying shit, but now we were hormonal teens so this was a mistake on his part because we had nothing to lose, gave no shits and knew how much he loved his car. one night, we shoved dog shit up his exhaust pipe and sealed it off with a used condom, used his aerial to poke more shit, covered his handles in shit, rubbed ketcup on his windows and let his tires down. that was when it all started. when it snowed we tried wrapping his car in cling film and poured warm water over it to get it to freeze over but it didn't work out too well, so we just covered it in snow and it stuck really well. this helped the water freeze over and give him a hell of a job getting it off. sometimes we would just steal his aerial or simply let down two tires, other times we would just piss against it. other things we did to him would be petty stuff like hiding his bin on bin day so the binmen didn't empty it, pelting his house with a dozen eggs on halloween, post shit through his letter box etc. i had a feeling he knew it was us, because he bothered us a lot less. i'm 24 now, it's been at least 5 years since we last messed with him because we are all getting on with our lives and definitely doing better than him. he tries acting friendly with me but keeps his distance. the lesson of this story is that those kids you fuck with will one day grow up and it will be too late to realize that you've molded a fucking monster.okay, so i am a bouncer. proof: username. i know this is long, but there is a tl;dr at the bottom there are nights however, when i go to the bar and drink on my nights off. this was one of those nights. so it's a wednesday night at the bar and i'm off. wednesdays are greek night and $5 pitchers of whiskey and coke. and they make the drinks very strong. so the bar is full of drunk frat guys and shitfaced sorority girls. now i have no problem with greeks, i was greek myself in college. i do have a problem with self entitled little fuckers who think that they're above everyone else. so i've been sitting at the bar for a few hours drinking and chatting with my co workers and it's around 1:00 a.m. the bar has a good amount a people in it. well i've been talking to this girl at the bar and she wants to go dance. i like to think my big ass can get down, so i oblige. we're dancing for a while when i see this cocksucking fuck ass dick mcsonofabitch walk in to the dancefloor area. he's a part of the douchebag fraternity on campus. the guys that jump people in the parking lot for looking at a girl wrong, the guys that can't get in trouble on campus because they've been there for so long, the self entitled assholes that do what they want because they think they're invincible. so this guy, his name can be p (for pussy), comes in the bar drunker than a three legged deer riding an escalator. he's grabbing at the shot girls and causing a ruckus all around. hey, it's my night off, i ain't dealing with this shit. but i keep an eye on him just in case i need to intervene. (once you're a bouncer, you stay a bouncer). he's bumping guys and yelling fuck you's to everyone that looks at him weird. he's looking for a fight tonight. well p seems to settle down a little bit and he gets on the dancefloor about 10 feet away from me. he's dancing (i say dancing, he looked like a 7th grader) and he keeps rubbing his hands all over her ass and legs. he gets a little ambitious and starts going for her waistband, to finger her i imagine. she keeps slapping his hand away. after a few times, he gets visibly frustrated. he decides that he's getting what he wants and goes straight to stick his hand up her skirt. she pushes him away with an "oh my gosh, get away from me" expression. he tries to grab her again and she pushes him and yells no. he grabs her even hard so she spits in his face. this all happened in a few seconds. well what happened next made me the angriest i have ever been in my life. he slapped her across the face. hard. so hard she fell to the ground. now i can stand a lot, but you don't ever put your fucking hands on a woman. i see red. i yell "mother fucker!" and go over to him as fast as i can (the dance floor was pretty packed) and i shove him against some railing that enclosed the dance floor. he swings and jaws me. from what the other bouncers tell me, it was a hard hit. i barely felt a thing due to the alcohol and anger. i swing back around and come down on his nose with my fist. it was an awkward punch, but powerful. he staggered back against the railing. i don't know why i did this, i guess i watched too much wrestling as a kid. i ran at him and clotheslined him and myself over the railing. i roll over on top of him and just start hitting him as hard as i could everywhere. the face, the chest, the neck, i wanted to cause as much pain as possible to this mother fucker who would dare hit a girl. i was eventually pulled off by the other bouncers. but right before i was, i headbutted the fuck out of him. p just laid there, not unconscious, but not moving and definitely in a lot of pain. his nose was crooked, probably broken, and blood poured down all of his face. his face was red, his lip busted, and his shirt was torn. i had teeth marks in my forehead and my jaw hurt. the whole incident happened in a short amount of time, but it felt like forever. the bouncers picked him up and threw him out of the bar. they said if he ever comes back, they'll beat his face in. my boss gave me a ride home and said he would have to write me up for having a fight. i didn't care. i was still so angry. the girl he hit is okay. i was just so dang mad that anyone would dare lay a hand on a girl and i wanted to do what i can so he could never hit a girl again. i have a friend in that fraternity who didn't care for p too much. he told me that p had two black eyes for a few days, his nose is broken, his tooth is crooked, and get this, he broke his thumb punching me in the jaw. from what i hear, he wanted to press charges, but once his parents found out that he hit a girl, they wouldn't let him. since they pay for every single thing he does, they have the power. i hope that mother fucker remembers me for the rest of his life, and takes that night as a lesson. i know that there are gonna be some of you that read this and want to bitch me out and say that was stupid and that i'm a horrible bouncer for having a fight at work. there's always a few of you. well fuck y'all. i don't know what y'all's morals are, but i don't stand hitting women. y'all can get on another thread and bitch to someone who gives a shit. tl;dr drunk asshole is drunk. tries to sexually assault a girl, she spits in his face. he hits her. i see red and go after him. punch, kick, headbutt, and hurt this guy. he gets a broken nose, thumb, two black eyes, and busted lips. he wants to press charges but his parents won't let him because they found out he hit a girl. also, titties. edit: i admit, this is more justiceporn than anything else. if you knew the guy on a personal level like i do though, you would understand how it's revenge for me. he causes a lot of problems in the bar, he's lead jumpings of my friends in the parking lot, and he's just a general douchebag to most. he needed to be taught a lesson. now whether or not y'all decide that this is revenge or not, i posted this for people to enjoy and relish that an asshole got beat.alright, so i just recently discovered this subreddit, and i love you all. the revenge stories are perfect, so i figured i'd share one of mine from a while ago. flashback to middle school. i'm maybe 13 or so, short, little chubby, and the new kid in a public school (former christian-private school student). so, i'm horribly socially awkward, as my former classmates i had known for years. now, i was at a school, where i knew no one. naturally, this made me a target for bullying. so, introducing the primary bully, wangster, as he was a suburban-white boy who thought wearing snapbacks, dc's, and listening to lil wayne made you a gangster well, everyday we had a reading block. nerdy me lost his mind when i discovered the school had a library with actual books. i read the entire harry potter series in two weeks. well, i'd get to reading block a bit earlier, and usually the teacher would let me sit in the class to get that extra time with the wonderful wizarding world. wangster and his friends would show up, sit directly behind me, taunting me. they were smart, and were only loud enough for me to hear, and not the teacher. when she would leave, wangster would pull the same stunt. "hey, that's my chair," followed by the seat i was using being pulled directly out from under me. i'd hit my head on the desk, and even got a bruise once. after the fourth time, i did what any sensible kid would do, and reported it to the teacher. now, the teacher knew that i had a rough time adjusting to school, so she confronted wangster and his friends. of course, they all back each other up, and nothing came about. well, that's a lie. after wangster found out i reported him, the bullying got worse. i'd be shoved into lockers in the hallway, get food knocked out of my hand at lunch, and my books mysteriously started disappearing (i kept multiple to bring home and read. seriously, i fucking love reading). so, one day, i decided to get my revenge. during this entire time, he still kept 'chair' gag, and thought it was the funniest shit. so one day, i sat, reading yet another book. when the walked in, i stopped reading, but faked looking like i wasn't paying attention. the teacher left the room for a moment, probably to get water or something. that's when wangster made his move. "watch this," he whispered. i carefully lifted my weight up off the chair. "hey, that's my..." fwooosh!!!!! i stood up as fast as i could, snapping my knees, sending the chair flying behind me. now, while i was a chubbier kid, i had also been playing tennis, both recreational and competitively for about five years. the chair flew back, nailing him square in the groin. he keeled over, tears almost welling in his face. the teacher walked in to see wangster almost crying, and me feigning a shocked look on my face. "what happened?" "i'm so sorry, wangster! i didn't know you were behind me." i apologized. i turned around to help him up, to which he smacked my arm away. "fuck you, clifford." he whispered under his breath. "here, you take this chair. i'll grab another." i said with a grin, just quiet enough for him to hear me. that concludes my story for now, i've got a couple others involving wangster and his comrades. **op has since been removed, but this was obtained from the cached version.** i had to come on here and get some kind of side-line perspective, because currently no one else in the family knows that the reason sil is deported is because of my wife. not sure i should out her either, in my current state of mind. sorry if this is long/disorganized. my mind is currently in chaos. background: we have been together for 8 years, no kids. basically, all of this began when my brother and sil moved back to our home country, after he had been living in sil's country. prior to that, my wife emma didn't have an issue with sil. my wife and sil are both from the states, but my wife has been living with me in my home country since we got married. my brother and sil are what some people might call free-spirited. sil is from portland (something wife rolls her eyes at) and is very "hipster". they both smoke regularly, something i don't have an issue with, but don't feel like getting involved with either. my wife has no issues with drugs/drug use but she can't stand how much my brother and sil talk about pot whenever we see them. six months ago, my wife decided to finish her master's degree and was offered an opportunity to do a semester abroad. coinciding with that time, my brother and sil moved back here permanently. however, from what i understand, sil is technically still on a tourist visa (which has expired by now since they came in february) and i'm not really sure what was going on with the whole paperwork process. they seem to be bad at planning. sil has mentioned before that she wants to have a kid with my brother because she would not only get paid maternity leave here, but it would cement her staying. she told my wife this over facebook messages, as well. when my wife left to do her semester abroad, and brother and sil moved in, we hung out a lot more. at first my wife was cool with it and would say hi, etc. but things changed when bro and sil invited me on a road trip to sweden, something that my wife has always wanted to do with me but we never got around to. after that, she would become short in her answers whenever i said i was hanging out with them. she began to make subtle comments about sil and the more i saw them, the more vicious the comments got. as a result, i didn't go out with my bro so much when i knew sil would be there. i love my brother, but honestly, he takes a lot of energy to be around, so it's not something i really minded too much. however, things came to a head when both sil and my wife entered the same photo competition. my wife entered first and then sil saw her post and entered two days after. then she and sil engaged in pretty childish subtle facebook statuses about each other (always masked as "someone" or "this person"). my wife was pissed and i took the opportunity to ask her what was going on between her and sil. she basically told me that she resented how sil got to see me all the time now and how she feels inadequate compared to her because sil does all the cooking (although its mostly those minimalist dishes people make for instagram, and not very appetizing for me) and i am the one who cooks in our marriage. sil is also asian, and i made the mistake of telling my wife that i had had a thing for asian girls back when i was 20 and everything japanese was all trendy. she was also upset that i had gone to bro and sil's wedding without her, while she had been abroad during her bachelor's degree. she also is afraid that i'm going to start smoking again because of them. i told her it was not something i was interested in because pot mostly makes me paranoid and depressed. she also brought up that she hates how i will talk shit about my brother and sil (mostly about their need to constantly talking about smoking and some of their very out-there ideas about things) but act perfectly fine to their faces. she said she feels like i'm placating her by saying sil is annoying, but i still go see her. she said it makes her feel like i will lie to fit the situation and that bothers her. well, i hadn't seen bro or sil for a few weeks now, and my wife and i were back to normal. she came home and we were having a good time seeing all our other friends. she didn't even bat an eyelash when i said some of the guys had invited me out for a guy's night. all was good. then last week my brother called and asked me if i wanted to hang out. he sounded pretty high and i told him no. emma casually asked what was up and i told her. she got a bit quiet then shrugged and went back to doing whatever. about 10 minutes afterwards she said she was going to take the dog for a walk and run to the shop to get some vegetables for dinner. this is basically what went down. she went outside, called the police anonymously, and said that she was a "concerned neighbor" and could smell marijuana coming from my brother's flat. the police came. my brother and sil were arrested and fined. however, when they went to pull up sil's profile to record the incident, they discovered her expired tourist visa. she had to be transferred to a sort of "holding" facility for people who are in queue for being deported. now there is a whole shitstorm happening. my brother is beyond upset and the family is shocked. this isn't really something that can be worked around as 1. marijuana is illegal in this country and 2. she was on an expired visa and they didn't file the correct paperwork for her to live here legally. so if she is deported, she may face a 5-10 year ban. this means either, the end of their marriage, or my brother will need to figure out how ot move to the us with her. the thing is, no one knows it was my wife, except me. and she doesn't even sound the least bit remorseful. we had a huge row about it and she stood by her decision, saying that if sil was that stupid to do illegal drugs as well as not have her papers in order, then it was on her. if i'm being honest, i don't care so much about sil being deported, but i care that my wife felt so threatened by her that she went to this length. she's the type to made subtle remarks and be frosty, but she has never done anything close to this before. so now i'm in a real bind. i really don't know what to do. i definitely cannot tell the family, and i don't really feel the obligation to anyway (i'm not close with my mom because she left me as a kid and i don't talk to any of my relatives really except my dad and brother). but i cannot just let this slide. i need to impress upon her that she has potentially ruined a marriage all in effort to remove someone she finds annoying from our lives. someone we don't even have to see every day. what advice can you guys give me? there's no one else i can even talk to about this. update: holy hell. this really blew up. i will post a real update soon, but your comments and messages are very appreciated. things are quite tense atm, but tomorrow we have agreed upon a sit-down. will update letting you all know what happens now with us and the situation. as of this moment sil is definitely being deported. tl;dr: wife and sil have rivalry, wife called the cops on sil while knowing that sil has an expired visa. sil is on her way to being deported. **edit: this is not my story. the story was posted in r/relationships by another user.**my aunt's story. what had happened was equally as simple as it was annoying. her group of friends would be walking by a cluster of upperclassmen, and as a scare tactic they would lean into their faces and bark at them like dogs. they captured the reaction they dreamed of so this sort of bullying happened for many weeks. not long after, this same "barking" bullshit was being used across the school. girls who got this treatment really lost their shit which just egged the seniors on further. my aunt and her closest friend were the only ones left that stood through the pestering to handle the situation. therefore, the targets on their backs had grown substantially. the final day the girls were approached had been building. towards the seniors they strode (each one prepped and determined to get a reaction out of the duo).they chorus of girls leaned in all at once and were just about to bark when- *shhhh* my aunt had defiantly shushed their stunned faces. faces watching her hand reach into her pocket. she tossed a handful of dog bones for the bitches and kept on walking. and that was the end of that. this is a cross-post from tales from tech support. i was told to post this here, as it definitely qualifies as pro revenge (you send me one spam? i help get your mlm company shut down and nail you for $270k out of your personal pocket). i've run it by the mods before i posted it, just to make sure it was kosher. i've redacted the links to the press releases as well as the actual entity's name; we'll be referring to it as the funky spammer. - - - - - tuxedo jack and craptacularly spignificant productions - present - those who hunt spammers - part the second - i'm up all night to get funky - - - - - nearly a year had passed, and it was the middle of october 2012. i'd left the managed services provider i worked at (the one what catered to the vapid bleached-blonde pennypinching harpy), and i was working at the hospital chain in austin. i'd gotten engaged, and i'd moved to an apartment one block from my office. the spammers who'd bothered me in 2011 had buggered off, never to be seen or heard from again, and the torrents of crap that had taken up so much space in my pst file trickled down to a few 419 scams every now and again. of course, there was still the occasional spam that got through, and those were usually deleted. life was pretty good. sure enough, though, that was a finite thing. more holes in openrealty's tell-a-friend function had been found, and people were using it once again to spam. payday loan affiliates spammed my inbox - my retribution was swift and severe. a bit of google-fu found the name and home phone number of the ceo of the company whose products they were spamming, and a quick call to his house (again, in arizona - what is it with that state and spammers?) during dinner got me the name and contact information for the affiliate who was spamming me. it didn't hurt that i namedropped when i called the president - he knew about the guy i'd nailed prior to this. needless to say, that ended spams from them quickly. one night, my phone dinged at 6 pm to signal an incoming e-mail. a quick look at it showed that it was a typical spam - it named a company whose name started with funky, which was a penny auction site similar to the zeekrewards scam that was shut down around august 2012. an affiliate link was inside it, run through a url shortener, but it wasn't anything that firebug and the network request panel in firefox (ctrl + shift + k, just fyi) couldn't track properly. i fired up camtasia to record my thought process while i went through analysis for the spam. and yes, this is the incident that spawned my infamous drunken profanity-infused spam analysis video to which i've made references to other times. no, you don't get to see it; it drops my real name in there. "well, let's see. the headers are spoofed, there's the use of a compromised openrealty server in the netherlands, there's no visible physical address for removal, there's no - huh, that's odd." at the bottom of the message, it said the following: i am sharing this opportunity just once but if you have doubts you can unsubscribe anytime by simply send a blank email to and put 'remove' as your subject the only question was where the hell were you supposed to send the e-mail to? there was no physical address, and the e-mail address was no doubt falsified. a wonderful, wicked idea struck me, and i opened up my laptop. while it booted, i kept going through my analysis, and i got the affiliate id from the link. a perusal of their site showed no functional privacy policy, no terms of service, nothing but a site that seemed designed to collect e-mail addresses and skype names for a future launch. however, they did have a page with their lawyer's bio on it, in which he had a link to his facebook page, so i paid a quick visit to said page and perused it for a bit. after a series of messages with him (amazingly enough, he was online at the time), in which i asked to be removed, he stated that he wasn't a point of contact for his client and said that i should go to them directly for opt-out requests. he didn't, however, give me the owner's name or any contact information. i shrugged it off. no matter, i'd have it easy enough after a bit of work. besides, who likes dealing with lawyers? at that point, my laptop chimed to signal that it was done booting, and i launched firefox on it. i navigated over to mail.yahoo.com, and for kicks and giggles, i attempted to create a new mail account with the same address the spammer had used as a reply-to. "let's see... **[redacted]** at yahoo dot com..." i snorted. "no way he's stupid enough to use an account that doesn't exist if he doesn't want can-spam violations." a few seconds later, i completed my mastery in the emulation of picard (read: facepalm) as yahoo allowed me to create the e-mail address successfully. i keyed in a variant on one of my usual passwords, and a few seconds later, i was at the inbox, which started to ding as replies with the word remove as the subject flowed in steadily. yes, that's right. i managed to create a mail account, one that was purportedly already being used for opt-out requests for a mlm / penny auction scheme's spammers, and thus managed to prove conclusively that the affiliate never had any intention of honoring opt-outs. but wait - it gets better. can-spam does have some teeth. the mccain amendment holds the key - the companies being spammed can be held liable for damages, ftc penalties, and remedies, if they know or should have known that their business was being promoted by spam. i was sure that this would pass a prima facie test for this - and after consulting with a lawyer friend of mine, i was reassured and then some. over the next day or two, i gathered information about the company - i dug up the llc records, which showed it to be an llc based out of montana. a few calls to various agencies later, i'd reached someone who'd given a damn, and i was told to forward on all the information i'd gathered about the company to the montana commissioner of securities and insurance, which handled such things like insurance, investments, and, as it happened, penny auction scams, for which it had issued a warning about for zeekrewards a few months prior. meanwhile, a metric assload of replies flowed into the yahoo account, most of which had bodies filled with expletives and profanity. everything i gathered, including credentials to the yahoo account, was passed on to them, as well as the ftc and sec. i noticed they didn't change the password to the account, but i didn't care, really. the bodies of the replies that came in were hilarious. i didn't hear anything from the mcsi for a few weeks, though i'd noticed the web had gone quiet about the site, and the mlm forums i lurked on for intel strangely seemed to have a lot of threads complaining about that company purged for no apparent reason. one brisk fall morning (translation: 75 degrees and dry - it is texas, after all) in mid-november, i walked into my cube and docked my latitude e5420, then went and got 32 ounces of cafe verona from the break room before sitting down and loading firefox. i loaded up the mcsi's site to see if there was an update on the funky spammer. i did not expect to see that the commissioner of securities and insurance had a press release up stating they'd ordered them to stop doing business! i mean, i'm sure as hell not complaining. it's rare as hell that you get to see your efforts vindicated in such a fashion. in all fairness, though, i'd be lying if i said i didn't do a happy dance and squee rather loudly in my cube. i was quite happy that a certain coworker whom i've mentioned before wasn't working there that day, because the look i would get from her would be both flabbergasted and gobsmacked, tinged with more than just a hint of "why the hell are you doing that at work," though the looks i got from the head of network security and my other nearby coworkers almost - almost - offset my joy a bit. a few weeks later, the mcsi put up a new press release in which they stated that the owner had been nailed for illegally selling investment opportunities. not only did they have to pay back the investors, the founder of the company ended up paying out of his pocket to reimburse them! ever since then, it's been very rare that i've analyzed spam. sure, there's tons out there. yes, they're annoying, pernicious, and the spammers are probably a rather large festering pimple on the collective ass of humanity. but when you get results like that, you just can't really top it, and a part of you doesn't even want to try, you know? - - - - - tl;dr: we are samurai - the keyboard cowboys - and all those other people who have no idea what's going on are the cattle. [moooo.]( - - - - - schadenfreude is a delicious thing. it's even better when you have the law backing you up. if you want to see more, check out my submissions to talesfromtechsupport.since i haven't made any acts of revenge as sweet as this (maybe the worst thing i did was tag along while my roommates poured water into another cunty ex-roommate's new benz she got from her sugar daddy when she forgot to close the sunroof)... not to mention it's kind of a reminiscence for my late father (r.i.p gordon c. w. 1957-2013) tldr: dad moved up to portland, developed health issues, sold house to a complete schmuck since his house was nearly impossible to sell, made sure schmuck had a bad time when he moved in after schmuck harassed him **back story** &amp;nbsp; in 2005, my dad moved up to portland due to cheaper housing prices, but nobody else was in a position to move... i had a business raking in pretty good money + other personal reasons, my grandma got senile/dementia and needed round-the-clock care right as he was closing escrow (but when she stabilized we couldn't afford to bring her up since now she needed 15 (!) meds and we'd have to pay out-of-pocket for her transition)... that left my stepmom to go up there with him, but she divorced 3 years later, so in late 2008 it was just him and 2 bengal cats. to make things worse, he was a level-headed guy, but his health rapidly deteriorated with arterial collapse, high blood pressure that he had every single side effect from, including depression and thoughts of suicide [that he acted on :-( ] that never went away, his full physical never tested his blood sugar but it skyrocketed to 700 on one er visit and all the complications that came with it, and cancer as the cherry on top. with the medical bills, he couldn't sustain a job due to frequent hospitalization and was on disability, and around 2012, my computer repair business collapsed and got a job that can barely sustain myself, let alone have a budget to go out there and at least visit the poor guy for the weekend, so he had no choice but to sell the house. at the same time, the housing market slowed down (especially portland), there was a crack house up the street that devalued the neighborhood, my dad had a knack for kitschy décor wasn't particularly tasteful, he was on the medical marijuana program so the house always smelled like chron and had a few plants growing, and last but not least, since he couldn't even afford to move, he had to depend on the proceeds of the house to afford his new living arrangements... all of that made his house a hard one to sell. so, after 5 months he finally sells off the house to this guy that was a bit of a prick from the get-go, but beggars can't be choosers. the contract said to give him 14 days after closing escrow to move out, but instead of waiting for that 14th day, the new owners loads up a u-haul the split second it closed escrow, parks it in front of the house and instead of nicely helping my frail, still-recovering-from cancer, they even go as far as breaking in and goading him; my dad even almost shot him since he thought he was a burglar. of course, getting portland pd involved was useless as they said it was a civil issue instead of treating it as harassment. **the revenge** &amp;nbsp; me, a few of my friends that knew his plight and of course his buddies put our heads together and put up all sorts of ways to screw with the house: * he pissed and crapped in most of the hvac floor vents, &amp;nbsp; * threw clumps of his cat's excrement into the hvac vents as well (which owing to the smell, it gave them carte blanche to piss/crap on the vents too), &amp;nbsp; * went into the attic and hid a cheap mp3 player+speakers above the master bedroom to turn itself on that played a creepy sound like scratches, animal noises and even spooky laughs every few hours at night (by getting a timer for the speakers to turn on at 1am, then i made a 2-hour long silent mp3 track and sent it via dropbox... i spent the entire afternoon walking him through it all over the phone and teamviewer on his computer, and it's probably the most expensive and involved prank, but it's worth it), &amp;nbsp; * removed the pins from certain door hinges, &amp;nbsp; * unscrewed the faucet aerators just enough to jet out if you turn it on, &amp;nbsp; * subscribed to every gay porno mag + controversial publication we can think of (such as nambla and kkk) to be sent to that address, &amp;nbsp; * poured stump out on the larger trees (one of his friends was a gardener who of course, specialized in stump removal), and &amp;nbsp; * dumped a few open cans of tuna between the wall studs.this happened last week and the details may be a bit off since it was told by my dad. all acronyms used here refer to either the company or company owner based on the context. my dad is a network consultant and distributor. his work involves selling and maintaining wireless equipment and providing communication solutions. a few months ago he was bidding for a multi million dollar government project, competing against rivalcompany(rc) and evilcompany(ec). rc and ec were friends as they sourced from the same manufacturer. a bit of background info: when my dad's company (dc) first started, him and rc were good friends as they both sourced equipment from the same manufacturer. after dc grew, my dad switched to a different manufacturer and slowly dc and rc started turning into rivals. however, my dad was a diplomatic guy and always maintained friendly relationships with rc. one of the requirements for being eligible for the project was that the company bidding needed to possess a special certificate(not sure of the name, but it was a huge process to obtain). but a company without the certificate could 'lease' it from another company possessing the certificate for a short period of time or if two companies worked together, only one of the companies needed to be certified. only rc and dc had the certificate. since ec was bidding via rc (working together), they didn't require a certificate. so if ec won, they would share the profits with rc as they only got in through rc's certificate. so the bidding begins and all the companies produced a quote. ec produced the lowest quote and won. now, dc also a consultant which meant once the bidding was finished, he would go through the winning company's quote to see if it was feasible to be implemented. and surprisingly, the winning bid was so low that even going by bare minimum, the company would actually be losing money. my dad knew about the agreement between rc and ec and decided to have a talk with the owner of rc. &gt;dc : any reason why you're losing out money on this project? rc : what do you mean losing out? we're making a nice profit. dc : are you sure? you might want to take a look at your bid over here. rc : this wasn't what we agreed on. hold on i need to check. rc called back a few hours later &gt;rc : i can't reach ec. he's in a meeting. dc : you have a bigger problem to deal with right now. the bid has no mention of your company. he's taken it on as a standalone company. rc : that's impossible. he doesn't even possess the certificate. dc : your company leasing out the certificate tells a different story. rc : no way. i never authorized that. these have got to be forged documents. now the way things work here, is that if you have a dispute with the bid, you'll have to file a claim and an enquiry would be launched which painstakingly slow and inefficient due to the number of authorities involved. and my dad can't testify to this as discussing the winning bid is illegal. &gt;rc : you have to do something. dc : you're in luck. his equipment is not capable of providing coverage to the entire district and it's really outdated. i'll bring this up in the board meeting after that my dad attended the meeting and brought up the problems in ec's equipment which made the government official reject ec's bid and hold a new project bid. this gave enough time for rc to file a report. the report went through, dc won the contract(yay!) ec was banned from participating from further projects (and a few charges were filed i guess) and the alliance between ec and rc ended. tl;dr : company tries to screw over friend, gets teamed up by friend and rivalthe previous situation: back when i was around 16 years old, i had this friend tom who had major issues with his physical education professor. he'd been going to the same middle-school (non-us) since he was 12 years old and through some odd cosmic joke every year he'd been assigned to the same professor. one that clearly had it out for him personally. you see, tommy wasn't particularly athletic or fit. i'm not saying he was lazy or in poor physical condition, he just wasn't the type for gymnastics or sports. this teacher on the other hand had this r. lee erney-type of "i will motivate you, private pyle!"-kind of mentality that, well, "just didn't work" with the likes of tommy. hence, for tom the last four years comprised a veritable litany of verbal abuse, poor grades (yes, gymnastics classes are graded in holland) and assorted petty crap directed at him by this dickcheese, gunnery-sergeant wannabe. tommy was always able to deal with crap he was dished-out by being a stone cold vindictive bastard. i'm not even kidding - all this happened 20 years ago and i'm somewhat afraid of him finding out i typed out and posted this story. they say an elephant never forgets anything? well, my childhood friend tommy would make the average elephant look like a mentally handicapped alzheimer's patient. this cute little boy had the power to hate! i went to another school than him, so i was never fully aware of the tensions between him and 1st. sgt. fuckface other than the occasional fuming recap of the crap the bastard had put tommy through recently and the subsequent "my vengeance shall be terrible!"-speech. but nothing ever seemed to happen. i chalked this up to him taking the "high road", forgiving the bastard his transgressions and continuing with his life. oh, how mistaken i was. the setup: tommy was now in his final year on middle school and it seemed that staff sergeant dickcheese was showing signs of relenting. the prof's unholy crusade showed signs of petering out, and a semblance of normalcy had been established. tom's grades were ok, nothing fancy, but he was going to graduate and as such, he applied to join the committee organizing the graduation party. looking back, this should've suprised everyone as he was in no way, shape or form the kind of kid to join any committee, group or organization that involved doing anything else than smoking pot or listening to music. but hey, to be really honest me and his other friends didn't really think anything of it. we chalked it up to him liking a particular girl in said committee or some other juvenile crap like that and left him to it. we were wrong. you see, the graduation party was to take place in the school's auditorium, so all tables, desks and chairs normally placed there had to be moved into the gymnasium for storage. and that was tom's angle: to sabotage, subvert and defile his arch-nemesis' lair - the gymnasium. six weeks prior to the party, tommy started saving up his allowance. no more cigarettes and pot - just a steadily increasing amount of cash money. on the day of the party, this had reached the equivalent of around $ 60 us, burning a hole in his pockets. on graduation day, tom had spent most of his after-school day hauling furniture from the auditorium to the gymnasium, stacking desk upon desk and chair upon chair. and he had been tremendously enthusiastic about it, too. so much so that the principal had given him the keys to the gymnasium, ordering him to lock it once done and make sure nobody would get locked in, as the school would be closed for summer-recess after the party was finished. so now tom had everything he needed for his plot of vengeance: access to the gym, a stack of desks to use as makeshift scaffolding and $60 in cash. the revenge: during a small break, tom went to the local butcher's shop and spent $60 on as many assorted meatstuffs as het could get his hands on. he came back to school with something like 20 pounds of meat - ranging from chicken and turkey to steak and pork. he then spent the entire night stashing this meat every place he could think of: over the ceiling tiles, inside of the lockers, he even crammed minced meat into the tubing of the wall-mounted climbing racks. and then he left, handing over the keys to the principal and going home. the effects: over summer, tom and i had a bit of a falling out and as i didn't have any other friends going to that school i never heard about the implications of tom's actions. that is, until my kid brother started going to that same school some 7 years onwards. it turned out that the day after summer recess, the teacher that inspired the whole action had also been the one to open the gymnasium post-summer recess. the gymnasium remained closed for two more weeks while the cleanup crews had to rip out the ceiling, most of the walls and bin the majority of the implements of sports usually found in a high-school gymnasium. as for the legacy of ton's actions: the horrors he brought upon the (now retired) professor have been spoken about in hushed tones ever since, finding their way into middle-school lore: "i heard that one day, mr so-and-so opened the gymnasium after a vacation and was assaulted by myriads of stinging insects". "i heard that once he opened the doors, he was assailed by a stench so putrid his hairs went white and he never could smell again!". ah, to be so young again.... legal action was attempted but failed due to lack of proof, or so i was told. tl;dr: professor picks on student for four years, student hides meat throughout gymnasium and leaves it there over summer recess, biology ensues edit: i accidentaly a word and a couple of enters. 'cause, formatting.i own a hair salon in a small town in the country. there is not a whole lot to do where we are, and my shop is not just a salon, it is a gathering place. many of my regulars have also become good friends. i have known allie almost three years and we have become pretty close. day before yesterday, allie came to my work almost in tears. a while back, she and her husband hit a rough patch and were considering divorce. while they were apart, she is friended by a man she's never met on facebook who she begins texting and later, sexting with, despite her better judgement. he gradually gets more possessive of her, even though they have never met in person. he knows her situation with her husband and gets very jealous... a few days ago, allie finds out she is pregnant, so she and her husband decide to try to work out their differences and stay together to raise their family (they also have two other girls under 6 years). everybody is happy.... that is, except facebook guy. allie tells him that she is pregnant and has decided to stay married and must no longer text him. he gets angry and threatens to tell her husband about their messages and pictures, despite the fact that nothing has happened between them.. even if it didn't ruin her marriage, he is threatening to embarrass her with it. the man is willing to try to ruin a pregnant woman's life, and break up a family... all because he feels that he is entitled to pictures of her boobs. that's where i come in... apparently, i went to high school with this man, and even though i dont remember him, we are facebook friends. allie just wanted me to flirt with him to distract him from her. but, i could never be presented with such a perfect example of an asshole and not try to make an example of him! at first, i play coy "i can't seem to place you, but you look familiar to me, cutie!" (he is not cute). i flatter him and get him to send me some nude pics. at first they are just close up pictures of his cock, so i tell him that "anyone can get a pic off the net. i wanna see your face!" i told him i was at work and couldn't send any back but it was so hot being around all these people and them not having a clue about the 'sexy' pics he is sending me. in reality, we are all gathered around my phone laughing our asses off at this egotistical misogynistic jackass. by the end of the night, i have received many, many nudes and even a video of him jacking off. (classy!) he might know allie and i know each other on fb (he lives in the next small town over) but has no idea how close we are. last night, i found out he is a higher level of jerk than any of us thought. he is 34, and hit on the 15 year old daughter of another friend he doesn't realize we know. when she put him down, he called her a whore. if there was ever a thought of going easy on him, it was dashed right then. we have a tentative plan... i want to lure him to the shop under the pretense of a haircut/get to meet you. just as we get him all settled in, allie will arrive for her hair appt. "well, facebook guy! i didn't know catfish troll was your hairdresser!: then i'll say "well, allie, i have kinda been talking to this fella (giggle giggle!)" we'd like to drag out the discomfort before i reveal to him the fact that none of this is a coincidence and if he doesn't leave my friend the fuck alone, i will wallpaper the entire tri-county area with his nude photos and upload his jerkoff film somewhere appropriate. i have saved all the texts and messages and will post them if there's any interest in how this plays out. i hope he shows up!!!! am i evil? tldr: jackass man throws big fit and threatens my friend. i pretend to like him and he sends me lots of pictures of himself. idiot has no idea she and i are friends. i had a shitty neighbor. his property abutted the rear (lol words rite?) of mine. he was a bitter old shit who spent his time in his extensive vegetable garden, on our property line. an italian guy, the kind whose home-grown tomatoes probably made his "famous" red sauce. we were a young family at the time, just the first wave of new people starting to gentrify the working-class neighborhood. we had a fixer-upper and a baby. we didn't have much money to work with that first summer, so i spent a lot of time in the yard doing my best to landscape the overgrown jungle left by the previous owners. i basically ripped everything out, until we had a lawn. we had record rainfall that summer, and everyone's property had standing water. that old shitdribbler starts screaming at me one day, while working out back. i can't understand half of it, because it's a mix of old man gibberish and italian. apparently, he was blaming my removable of massive weeds on my property for flooding his garden. it didn't have anything to do with the regular deluges of rain we were getting, or that our properties were at the bottom of a hill. once my attempt at reasoning had worn out, i ignored him, turned up my headphones, and went back to work. i was ripping out the last long stretch of weeds and laying grass seed along the rear property line. the next day, we get a knock on our door. it's a city inspector, asking us to show them the drainage we installed without a permit. i had no idea what they were talking about, so i asked how they knew about it. they claimed they couldn't say, but they wanted to see the rear property line i had worked on yesterday. i simply told them that i had not installed drainage, i had removed weeds and seeded. pointing out the supposed drainage location, i indicated that no one in their right mind would install drainage there. they agreed and left. the plot curdled slightly. i should mention that this wasn't just me - that old shitswallower had a similar demeanor with his other abutting neighbors. one of them was a hard-drinking carpenter who lived next to me, and he recommended that i just offer to beat the fuck out of that old shitbagger like he did the last time that old shitsharter complained to him. apparently, that was the reliable standard in the neighborhood. i, however, was not interested in beating up an old shitshrifter who was clearly all too happy to run to the city with lies. i went about my business, until that old shitstrainer yelled at my wife and baby while they were alone in the yard one day. my mother was helping at the house, and went outside to see what was happening. that old shitsharpie screamed at my mother, too. old man spittle, incomprehensible words, surprising volume, shaking jowls, etc. well fuck him. the old neighborhood may have opted to beat the shit out of that old shitsundae, but he was quite clearly too full of shit for anyone to ever completely beat the shit out of him. i pulled some money from other house projects and i built a fence. it was a gorgeous suburbanite fence. it was made out of resin, a brilliant white, and installed professionally by fence...ers. it was a perfect white picket fence, the american dream of fencing, a beacon of gentrification hope in the middle of a working-class neighborhood of overgrown yards and cars on blocks. i have a muricaboner just thinking about it. except for that old shitsargeant - our shared property line did not get a white picket fence. our shared property line got an 8 foot tall solid security fence. i watched him that day, from my window, as that old shitmilker stood in his garden and glared at the workers installing the resin equivalent of the berlin wall along our property line and his beloved garden. that old shitslapper may have noticed the temperature dropping, because his entire garden was now cast in shadow. i waited at the window most of that day. i watched his garden. i watched him in his garden. i watched him wait for the sun to come back. the sun did not return to his tomatoes. with his gaudy landscaping of cheap waterfalls, ornamental trees, and various other tasteless crap, and my new fence, his garden no longer had much sun exposure. the weather got colder, the fall and winter passed, and i saw less and less of that old shitminion. i saw him replant the next season, but i rarely saw him outdoors after that year. his garden was meager, according to my view from our second floor. when i started this post, i told you that i had a shitty neighbor. the following winter, i saw someone new in that old shitnibbler's yard. i never saw that old shitsmoker's family, presumably because his attitude towards his neighbors carried over to his family. i greeted the newcomer, thinking he had just moved in. it turned out that he was that old shithustler's son, and that that old shitjockey had deteriorated over the year and had to be moved to a care facility. i'm assuming he died that year, because a new family moved in during the summer. i removed the security fencing and replaced it with picket to match the rest of the property. good fences make good neighbors.some background info: this guy was had bullied me during intermediate school (grades 5-6). this story takes place during high school my sophomore year about a year ago. this guy, lets call him 'arse', gets involved in the group called vemma. basically it's a huge pyramid scheme where they try to make you sell energy drinks called verve to others and recruit others into the group. joining costs $500 dollars to get product to give out to people and you pay $100 every month for a refill. i personally loved these energy drinks but there was no way in hell i was paying for them. (additional info at the bottom) arse messages me on facebook trying to get me to go to a meeting at a guys apartment for a business meeting and that there would be free energy drinks. he never specified what it was for but i went anyways. i listen to what they have to say and figure what it is and i tell them that i don't have the money but if he pays for it that i would make enough money to pay him back. he knew i was smart and he thought i would be able to do it. i wait a few days for iirc was 180 cans of drinks to arrive. as soon as i get them i close the vemma account and message him "karma is a bitch isn't it? thanks for the drinks" the goal of the game is to keep them on the phone for as long as possible. my record is 53 minutes. here is how it works... me: hello? tm: hi, could i interest you in useless crap today? me: why yes, yes you can. i've always wanted to buy useless crap from someone i've never met, over the telephone. is there different levels of useless crap? could i purchase the gold plated crap? would you like my credit card now or later? tm: please hold while i connect you with our sales specialist. me: yes please! tm: hello. i am the useless crap sales specialist, how can i help you? me: i want to purchase the gold plated useless crap please. tm: excellent! can i get your credit card number please? me: ya, hang on just sec while i run upstairs and grab my wallet. do you mind if i put you on hold for just a sec? tm: of course. take your time. set you phone down at this point and go do something. anything really. after about 5 minutes return to the phone and tell him you can't find your wallet and that it must be in the laundry - please hold. repeat this with other locations (car, truck, garage, cellar, bathroom, closet, etc). i like to play this game while watching a tv show and i only pick up the phone during commercials. they will stay on hold as long as you reassure them that you intend to purchase their crap. i once had a manager call me back after the sales specialist had hung up. the manager was pissed and was cussing at me about me being an asshole. i tried to reassure him that i truly wanted to purchase his crap but he just kept saying "don't play fucking games with me!". i laughed and laughed and laughed once he had hung up.alright, this story more or less comprises the last two years of my life. i'm currently a math/compsci (or possibly comp.sec.) major intending on going to a major university on a scholarship. as part of a rather poorly thought out and even more poorly executed plan to *"improve standards!"* i had to take junior and senior math from the new teacher. she was terrible. you see, this particular teacher had absolutely no understanding of math, whatsoever. the school required her class (unofficially. the principal was an even bigger prick than her, but you can't in em all) junior year because of the act (you should have seen how scores tanked). this was bad, because beyond being an idiot, she was a self-righteous, proud, whiny bigot. for example, she has a habit of trying to bully students who disagree with her into submission. (strike one!) she also likes multiple choice tests. so do i. the problem is that her tests rarely have the correct answers as an option. (strike two!) she also had no idea how to teach the math. a single simple example problem would take 45 minutes, or until a student figured out how to do it and solved it for her. otherwise class was just trying different methods to solve a problem over and over again. she loved the phrase "and that's how you *don't* solve this problem!" (with a big cheesy grin). we heard that eight or ten times a class. (strike three) (turkey) now, i took her class junior year and muddled through it, bored out of my mind, irritated because she would fail me on the same assignments that my friends had aced (i copied an assignment once just to see what the shift was. she usually dropped my grades by thirty or forty points on average.) i tutored the other students in the class, trying to help them pass, for which i got a detention and a stern talking to. (i also failed the assignment for "cheating") ********** senior year would be different. ********** first semester of class, i did nothing but cause her pain. i'd gotten a guaranteed full ride from the aforementioned university, so i knew she couldn't touch me. the time she spent trying to solve a problem, i'd solve it in fifteen seconds or so in my head, tell the guy behind me who would then write it down, and then proceed to make sarcastic remarks and making fun of her general stupidity to the other students. eventually i'd get bored and sleep until the guy behind me woke me up and nodded, meaning that they'd finally solved the problem and i had been right. she got incredibly desperate towards the end, trying to expel me for insubordination, trying to make me repeat high school by failing me (please, i had eight math credits), to trying to bring the principal in to bully me into agreement. up until she tried to expel me, i was playing nice. she treated me like crap, i treat her like crap, we can both hate each other. then this happened. i should note that my mother teaches ***math*** at a local university, and is second or third from the head of the department. about this time she gets involved and starts being an "observer", using this as an opportunity to shred the teacher's remaining reputation while we filled out letter after letter to the school board and i threw out via the internet and school board meetings the general incompetency of the teacher. i'm friends with a number of school board members. by second semester, i'd had enough and dropped the class. she relaxed on everyone else, and found out she had been fired. it's hard to come back from that. tl;dr: idiot teacher tries to get pushy, i get her ass fired. edit: i only managed to drop the class because i was friends with the school board. many people couldn't drop her class, even though they had the credits and they didn't need it. a lot of people lost scholarships and took huge hits to their gpa due to this teacher's unfairness and bullying. i know at least two students that lost full rides to major private colleges.**backstory:** my house is relatively big, and my aunt lives with me, my mom, my dad, and my brother. she's a crazily devout hindu, to the point that she **hates** all other religions (and races, for whatever weird reason). she curses them all the time, yet nobody really knows about it but me. **the story:** so my aunt's just gotten a new boyfriend, and it looks like he's *the one*. problem is, he's just like my aunt: bitchy, self-centered(except when it comes to my aunt), and a devout hindu who hates other religions. i didn't really care about how hateful they were against others because it didn't really affect me in any way. that was before *it* happened. basically, my christian friend and i were working on a project for our ap world history class. i invited him over to my house, thinking nothing could go wrong. boy, was i wrong. immediately after he got to the house, my aunt greeted me, and asked what the "white trash" was doing here. throughout his stay, they cursed him in my native language, they stopped him and i from getting snacks, and made sure he felt altogether terrible during his stay. now, it got personal. and how perfect a time: they had just set the wedding date. over the next few weeks, i told my friends what i was planning to do, and invited one "foreign"(as in, not indian) friend over per week. i kept a recorder(not the instrument) in my pocket running at all times. keep this up for a few weeks, and you've got yourself some amazing incriminating evidence. soon, it would be time to unveil my greatest(read: only) evil plan ever. wedding week rolled around, and soon, it was time. i'd prepared a short paragraph, and then a video showing their wrongdoings. my turn came to speak, i said my paragraph, and i showed the video to the *entire* family. the video started and ended, and as i saw their jaws drop lower and lower, my grin grew wider and wider. at the end, i maniacally laughed, and my parents took me home. i'm pretty sure they beat the shit outta me once we got home, but i don't really care for that part. tl;dr my aunt was a bitch to my non-indian friends with her husband(then boyfriend), i take recordings of her bitching, compile it into a video, and show it at her wedding.first post ever. i'm not exactly a wordsmith, so please be kind. this story starts off about 12 years ago in high school. 16-year-old me dated this girl for a year and a half. first love and all. anyways, she was in the grade above me so when she graduated, shit started getting weird with her. she became very secretive and distant. i kind of knew something was up, but wasn't sure. one time after a shower, she asked me to grab her some clothes out of her dresser so i obliged. there was a note in her underwear drawer (it was high school) from this dude in one of my classes that basically just said how stupid i was and he couldn't wait for her to break up with me. well, i lost my shit and confronted her and she folded. we broke up that day and didn't really speak for a long time (her brother and sister and i were kind of close). fast forward 4 years and she's still with the dude, which at that point, i'm fine with. i've moved out of town, they'd moved out of town, there's nothing connecting us. one day out of the blue, she texts me and says that her and dude are having some problems and she's in town and wants to meet up and talk. well, talk turned into some pretty rough, angry sex and she told me that she didn't think it was going to work out with dude and she wanted to get back together. i told keep that she needed to call him and break it off first. she did so with some hesitation and tears. i made sure she said it was because her and i were getting back together. he seemed blindsided. it had to be hard because all of her stuff minus the clothes on my floor were at their place, but she went through with it. after drying her tears she looks me in the eyes and says that she's happy we can start over and be together again. i straight up tell to get the fuck out of my house and never come back. i literally push her into the hall (she's still in basically nothing) while she's crying and completely mind-fucked. i could hear her crying as she walked out and slammed the door. then watched her get in her car and drive off. i'm not normally a vindictive person. i didn't go into it with the plan of doing this and honestly, felt horrible about it for the longest time.**/r/prorevenge metrics:** total subscribers: 50,014 subreddit rank: 694 subreddit growth &amp; milestones: i wish this was my story but alas it is a fellow construction workers. see he's a carpenter in many forms, trim, framing, cabinets, stair wells you name it the guy builds it. well he's like the rest of us avengers and doesn't take kindly to pushy no pay builders. he built a very fine, very elaborate stair well for a massive home, almost mansion dimensions. lo and behold pushy no pay builder who i quote said " i've been building houses longer than you've been alive" aka dad handed me a job and i fly with it, flat refuses to pay for my friends quality work. taken aback my friend eats it for a few days and then does the unthinkable. he disassembled the whole stair well, not in a nice way either, with hammers and brute man anger. needless to say he didn't get paid but he didn't get sued either so take that no pay builder.about 5 years ago, a friend of mine was being bullied online by her boyfriend's ex and her friends. they were commenting on her appearance, calling her a slut, basically typical mean girl comments. they were really going after her and a friend who was tried to defend her. literally an entire thread of insults and hate. the girl who was posting most of the insults (we can call her "jess") was a friend of mine until she did something similar to me. after watching this barrage of hate unfold for about 2 days, yours truly decided to step in and try to end it. i was moving out of state in a few weeks anyways, so i really wasn't worried how i would be perceived by anyone in my town anyways so i really let all these girls know exactly what i thought of them. basically, i called everyone who insulted my friend out on their personality flaws. i went the extra mile with jess however, telling her she would probably never do anything worthwhile with her life. i told her, "you will probably end up staying in (my town) for the rest of your life, working the same or some similar crappy job (she was a server) because you don't bring any other value to society other than petty drama." a little harsh, i know, but i didn't care. it needed to be said. fast forward to this weekend when i came to visit some friends. we decided to go out for dinner before we start the night time festivities. when we arrived at the diner, guess who is going to be our server this evening? the look of shame on her face was enough for me to know that karma does exist. i didn't say much to her, certainly nothing mean this time, but she was being very passive-aggressive towards me. when it was time to pay the bill, i signed my receipt and left a small note at the bottom that said "don't you just hate that i was right?"so did anyone see the art critique freak out video? it might be faked but that sort of thing really does happen. i used to be an art student (computer graphics) at a stupid expensive art school and i've experienced a freak out much worse than that first hand. art critique story time if you want it: have you all seen the dove commercial? so to sum that up, the women in that commercial describe themselves as uglier than they really are. the artists draws their description and they leave. another person comes in and describes the same woman with more accurate detail, usually much prettier than the woman describing herself. well there was this girl in my first drawing class who had the opposite problem. she'd draw really well rendered self portraits of herself, much skinnier and better looking. which is fine normally, but she also distorted major features like eyelashes (the drawing had big thick ones while she had none) and fuller lips (hers were very thin), she looked a lot more like a relative of the honey boo boo family + red hair. again, it's totally fine if that's how she wants to see herself, no one commented on it for a long time. but the problem with her, she would point out to many other girls "your cheeks look a bit thin in your drawing, i think you should have drawn your jaw line softer". just underhanded and hypocritical remarks. the professor would point out that other people's drawings had less issues than she was pointing out. she kept contradicting him though. i'm still convinced that the prof decided to get his revenge on the final assignment. the final would be a fully finished self portrait. if the class couldn’t tell who the portrait belonged to, it couldn’t get more than a c(it was 50% of our final grade). over the class, her portraits had been becoming more and more distorted, not resembling her or anyone that could even be related to her. the final colored portraits were due and they were handed in a pile. the prof picked them up and placed them on the wall. most of them were easily recognizable except for hers. it was a portrait that looked like scarlett johanson. the guy next to me said, “i didn’t know scarlett johanson was in the class”. i don’t think anyone honestly even knew it was honey boo boo girl’s portrait. the features had warped so much from her last homework, it was sort of unexpected. so the prof asked, “who’s is this?”. honey boo boo stood up with this shit eating grin to announce it was hers. he opened the floor to critique and reminded us, for the first time ever, that our participation grade will be impacted based on our ability to critique everyone’s finals. meaning we had to lay into her or watch our grades suffer. we had to say what he wanted to, but would get in trouble for. it took the whole class verbally laying into her portrait for 30 minutes before she broke down, started lashing out at some of the more attractive girls in the classroom for putting so much pressure on her(for just existing apparently). eventually several people started attacking her back, until one person called her fat and she lost it (objectively she was fat). she cried and cried but didn’t want to give up the spotlight. she just stood there sputtering and basking in all the negative attention. sort of funny to note, the guys in the room backed off as soon as she started crying, i think the girls saw through her bullshit and kept up the defense. the professor just sat there with the best poker face i have ever seen in my life. the professor ended the last class early, since she wouldn't do the sensible thing and just leave. it sort of sucked since i didn't get a critique on my final but it was worth the show. she ended up getting a c in the class i think, despite her portraits all being really well rendered. **tl;dr - honey boo boo keeps drawing herself like a supermodel. she’s difficult with everyone in the class during critiques. professor gets the class to critique her final self portrait as hard as she's been critiquing everyone else. she explodes when class predictably turns on her.** edit: so someone figured out my personal information through stalking my reddit account and threatened to use it to get me fired. it looks like i'll have to delete this. so long reddit account of 4 years. wife and i are with her sister who totally fucked her over on an $800 phone bill. we're parking in los angeles and she asks if it's cool to park there because she's too lazy or stupid to read the sign. it wasn't cool to park there. wife says "yeah you're totally good!" knowing full well... nope. not only did sister get a ticket but got a boot too due to more unpaid tickets (like bills.) i had driven myself and made an excuse as to why i couldn't give her sister a ride. [this]( status showed up in my newsfeed. basically, he got up to do something and was logged out of the public computer he was using, and lost a lot of unsaved work. his retaliation was a little over the top in my opinion...what do you think?**prologue** as any normal person, i dealt with some bullying coming through elementary and middle school. in high school this intensified as i was relatively new to the area. i remember one upperclassmen, kyle, made it his duty to torment me. he would trip me in the hallway, tease me, and he even defaced my posters when i ran for student council. this bullying culminated one day when he threatened me with a bb gun. he stupidly brought it to school and busied himself with shooting the walls in one of the regular student hang outs. at the time i had thought nothing of it. eventually he began aiming the gun at students and firing so bb's would bounce of the walls and hit them. soon enough he targeted me. i was not having it that day. i had just lost the election and i placed my student council loss on him and his upperclassmen friends. i asked him to stop but he continued to fire bb's near my legs. things escalated quickly as i literally stood up to him. one of my friend's tried to pull me back saying, "he's just an asshole man, let's just go." i couldn't deal. i *told* him to stop. he paused for a moment then aimed the gun at my face. he had a female friend beside him. she tried to settle him down and pleaded with him to stop, "he didn't do anything kyle, stop it." i remember his smug face in detail as he held that bb gun on me. he asked me, "why don't you make me?" i had no good response. i thought to myself, "you messed up man, here was your moment to stand up to him and you've got nothing." at the last second, i said, "why don't you shoot me then pussy?" he smiled as a i stood there and raised the bb gun back on me. i didn't even think about moving. then, *nothing*. he chickened out. his female companion got up to leave and he followed. i had won this round. **the revenge** it was a few weeks on when my dad &amp; i pulled into our local gas station to fuel up. dad twisted off the fuel cap, grabbed the pump handle, and squeezed to begin filling but nothing came-out (these were days when we transitioned from post-pay to pre-pay). then i heard a familiar voice over the gas station pa system, "hey guys, that's not how it works anymore, you have to come in." this was said in perhaps the smuggest tone i have ever heard in my life so far. as we walk in, i see that it is kyle and i immediately formulated a plan. that night i went to a 24/7 walmart and bought spray paint and gloves with some cash. i don't even know why they let that slide. i was still under 18 at the time. i dressed in a black outfit when i got home and slinked over to the gas station. it was closed. all over the clean white paint of the building i wrote kyle's name. not just his first name, his full name. first, middle, and last. i wrote it on the front of the building, the back of the building, and the sides. i wrote it in cursive and in regular script. *it was beautiful*. i felt some regret about it when i had got home but i stopped worrying when i thought of who i retaliated against. **the conclusion** kyle lost his job. we were even. he didn't even bother me anymore. i don't think he ever suspected me. a couple days later my spray paint art was covered with some whitewash. **epilogue** things got better as high school went on. i made a bunch of friends and was elected to student council the next year. i guess you need to prove your mettle when you move to a small town. **edit: in the future, i will be mindful of others when plotting revenge. in the end i think my act caused very little collateral damage. a gallon of white exterior paint costs ~20$. i'd just hope that they got kyle to paint over my handiwork himself before they let him go.** sorry for the wall of text. there will be a tldr at the bottom. -background it was the summer after i finished fourth grade. i was at my daycare 6 days a week because my parents both worked full time. there was a kid that liked to physically abuse me and all the other kids at the daycare. he was definitely a troubled kid. he had adhd and took meds daily for it (i asked the teachers why he took meds everyday and it was explained to me). during the summers his parents would let him skip taking meds because he acted like a zombie (understandable iyam). while kid was off his meds he would beat on me and others relentlessly. he was a year younger than me (and 6 inches shorter) and i had been going to this daycare since preschool so it was expected of me to know not to retaliate to him but rather walk away and rat him out, which i did but there is only so much a daycare aid can do to control a wild child. anyway, over the years i’ve been around this kid, i had received bruised ribs and one broken one, a broken toe, and minor cuts and scrapes. other kids got hurt as well. knocked down from trees, shoved, sand in eyes; you know…the classic little kid bully shit. we put up with a lot and this kid only got time out. it was obvious every kid hated this little bag of dicks which lead to the teamwork needed to defeat this kid once and for all. -the catalyst. i’m playing in the dirt by myself doing who knows what. i’m a bored kid; i don’t know wtf i was doing. anyways this little shithead comes up to where i’m at and destroys whatever i was making. i get pissed off. hey man it was my dirt creation and i’ll be damned is this little fuck will bully me forever. i get up and shove him away and say “fuck you dude, leave me alone”. heck yea that will teach him. the end of my suffering is now! the little dickbag runs away. i’m victorious. i go back to my dirt and begin trying to rebuild whatever it was. i hear running behind me. i turn my head to see that bastard running at me with scissors from a teacher’s office in his hand. i’m fucked. he jumps at me and lodges the scissors about an inch into my thigh, right though my jeans, and leaves them in there and runs off the ultimate winner. i cry, my parents come and take me to the hospital blah blah blah you know how it goes. next day i’m back at daycare quarantined in a teacher’s office for the next 3 weeks till my leg heals enough for me to be able to play around without pain. (i was not being punished. i was there to heal.) during those 3 weeks of what to me seemed to me like punishment, my rage grew. i will kill this kid. he will know real pain when i’m out of this office. 3 weeks go by and i’m ready for some sweet revenge. i plot with my 2 oldest friends to get the teacher distracted from the play area so i can have some one on one time with satan’s son (the dickbag if you didn’t figure it out). my friends will hop the brick fence while the teacher is watching and run off in different directions. my friends like the plan and agree it is worth the punishment to get back at the kid. -the revenge. i’m in the playground, so is that little bastard. i signal to my friends to execute the plan. they jump the fence. the teacher watching the play area runs off to go get my friends. i’m alone with that fucker…finally. i immediately run at him while he is playing in the sand box. i get a good kick right in his face. he gets knocked flat. damn that was too quick, but oh well. i won’t beat him while he is down. he knew he had it coming. i turn around and walk away leaving him to his sobbing. victory is mine… suddenly i fall to the ground. that fucker kicked me from behind right in the ding dong. one of those kicks with the tip of your shoe that just smooshes the balls right to your taint. i’m fucked. i can’t get up. he runs off as i struggle to regain my breath and dignity. as i start to get up, defeated, that fucking kid comes back with one of those huge push brooms and proceeds to hit me with the bristle end, not causing much damage but definitely building up my rage (and adrenaline). after a couple whacks, i stop his next swing and punch in right in the sniffer. i broke his nose, i heard it (and it was later confirmed to me). blood on my hands and him sobbing and bleeding on the ground. i’ll be damned if he gets up this time. i run off and grab one of those big wheel tricycles, lift it over my head, and deliver the most powerful hulk smash a 4th grader could deliver. the little fuck goes limp and begins doing that loud scream/crying. the teacher is back with my friends to find a bloody little shithead on the ground and me standing over him, victorious. proud of what i’ve done. i gladly get taken to the office to be scolded and have my parents called to take me home. my dad arrives, hears the story from the teachers, threatens me with the worst belt whooping i’ve ever had, and takes me home. as soon as we get inside the car, he turns to me and says in the most serious tone, “today you learned to defend yourself. this is the only time i will not punish you for fighting.” i respond with silence and just stare at my feet. my dad then says with the biggest smile, “hot damned you kicked the shit outa that kid though huh?” the parents never brought that kid back to daycare. i returned as a king of the playground. tldr: kid abused me for years, eventually stabbing me with scissors sending me to the hospital. i kick the shit out of him and bash him with a tricycle. edit: formattingthis story is fairly recent, last summer to be precise. i went up to a big name college to take some summer courses and the college gave me an apartment with three other people taking the same classes. i got along really well with two of them, lets call them jeff and mark, but the third one, we will call john, was constantly getting on my nerves. let me explain the living situation to get a better understanding, there are two bedrooms a shared kitchen, bathroom and living room. my real roommate was john. we got along fine at first but he never understood basic common courtesy things like not staying up till 2am with all the lights on watching tv while your roommate is trying to sleep. this happened more than once, i needed to wake up at 6 to make my lab time. i would find myself kicking him out of the room and he acted like i was the bad guy. after a while we got a chore list together so the house would be somewhat clean and no one was doing more than someone else. it was all fair and on paper it worked. the list was mostly rules on doing the dishes. you use it you clean it. if you didn't clean it, which would happen to us all, you just clean the sink out once a day and it revolved between the four of us unless the dishes weren't yours at all. simple right? not for john. he would never wash his dishes and used double the dishes as the rest of the house. so what happened when it was his turn to clean the sink out? he just didn't do it, saying he has too much work do to his classes. that was the biggest bullshit we have ever heard, we all have the same classes there is no difference whatsoever. we could still find time to clean and work on projects. giving him the benefit of the doubt i believed him thinking that maybe it takes him longer to get homework done. this was not the case, seeing how far he was with the homework i found him watching tv, books unopened and work not even started. this is an hour after asking him to do the dishes. so he clearly had enough time and then some because he never even started his homework that night and just played xbox and watched tv. the rest of us went home for break and left his dishes in the sink, hoping he would finally pull his weight. we were surprised when we got back to find them done, but soon learned he didn't do them, his mother did. his parents live 3 hours from the college and she came up to visit but instead cleaned his mess. he is 21 by the way and his mother was still picking up after him. we couldn't believe it. weeks pass and jeff, mark, and i never left any dishes in the sink because we were tired of the mess and how disgusting it looked. but john didn't care he still left uncleaned dishes in it. within a week it was filled with john's crap to the point where it was unusable. we had it, we told him we would stop driving him to class if he didn't clean his share. he didn't and had to walk to class for a couple of days. no progress. i changed the password on my router so he couldn't use it and be without internet(all homework and projects must be submitted online). still he didn't care. then we gathered all of his dishes and put them in a garbage bag, and threw it on his bed, hoping he would get the hint. still being dense asshat he was, he did not clean them. the crap then soaked through the bag and onto his bed. this then made him clean them. this took 5 weeks for him to finally pull his weight. from then on we just had to mention a garbage bag and he would suddenly find time to do his chores. tl:dr roommate never cleaned his dishes, dishes found a new home in his bed.i don't post on this sub, however i usually quite enjoy the stories. i couldn't find a better place to put this, so here's the flip side of the coin of revenge. so a couple days ago i had a friend over. we've known each other since high school, but we've only ever just been friends. she and i decided to hang out at my place, and it was fun. the next day, i wake up to my car covered in spray paint. like, hood, roof, lights, doors, windows, fucking grill, everything. now, i used to have some enemies, but i've long since grown up and become a chill dude, so i couldn't imagine why someone would do this. the writing said: "don't touch her", "i'll kill you", "seriously" so i was concerned enough to call the cops. they show up, i fill some shit out, and we find the spray can thrown into the bushes near the car. as the officer and i are discussing possible suspects (or lack of) we are approached by a nice old lady. she asks me "are you the owner of this vehicle?" to which i admitted. she asked me if i knew a tiffany(name changed because duh!), and i run over to my car. there it was, in huge white lettering "tiffany", and then it clicked. she had broken up with her ex a month ago, and it turns out he lives down my street. he must have seen us getting in and out of my car when she came over, and decided in his infinite wisdom to fuck with my life. i text tiffany, and it turns out she received a text the night before that was from her ex. it appeared at first glance to be a pic of him with cum on his chest, but upon closer inspection, we noticed it was bright white, and drippy as fuck. paint... he had fucking paint on his chest. so now, because some piece of shit 30 year old man-child thought i was seeing his ex/decided i deserved a new paint job, i have to deal with potentially thousands of dollars in damages. here are pics for proof [here]( and [here]( i don't think this post breaks the rules, however if it does, let me know! if anyone cares about the current status of the case: the warrant for his arrest is supposed to be submitted/active today. i get a free 250 meter restraining order, and if i see this piece of shit in person i'm breaking both his arms :d. update: i fucking cleaned my car. this happens again, i'm blinding him with acetone. so here's my car [now]( and [now]( and [now]( i'm so fucking done with this. i'm a big guy. not huge, but strong. but this story takes place in eighth grade football. at the time i was roughly 5' 9" and 160 lbs, and i would routinely go up against 220-240 lb linemen. (i played left tackle) and win. this story took place during one of the last games of the season, before the championships. the team i was on was the bucaneers, and lets say i played against the vikings. the half back from the vikings was a total douche i knew from school. he was the most popular player on their team because he was a good player and would relentlessly harass anyone who wasn't good enough. you know the type. he was a dick to everyone, disrespected coaches, teachers, parents girls, boys, and thought the world owes him everything. now during the buc-viking game, the bucs were losing very badly. i'm talking 7-28 in the fourth quarter. the situation was utterly hopeless, and our coach told us that we had a good game, and to not feel bad for ourselves. so yeah, we were toast. the last thing any of us wanted to do was go back out and get destroyed another play, but we were in our own 10 yard zone, and nobody wanted the score to get any worse. we hobble over, get set, and the vikings run a new, trick play. in the last quarter, with absolutely no hope of being beaten., on a team whose already given up. dick move in the first place, right? they get a touchdown, and the crowd goes wild, except for our parents, who are just shouting good job, at this point. and i've been tripped in the mob that is the line, which is not normal, because normally i'm standing over the other guy, helping him up. (i was a weird football player.) well guess who carried the ball for this touchdown? that's right, mcdouche the halfback. he stands up. he spikes the ball, and he screams his best victory screech. i look over at the sideline, and mcdouche kicks me in the back of the head. it was not an accident because he's staring at me smiling. i'm pissed. i yell for the ref, saying that this idiot just kicked me in the head, kick him out of the game. he just says he didn't see it, sorry. mcdouche laughs at me and we go to the kickoff. *we end up actually scoring within 4 mins of game time after this incident. forgot to mention it. after we score, it's time for another kickoff. i line up, the kickoff starts, and my friend the kicker launches it up into space, giving me plenty of time to get underneath the ball. i'm sprinting as fast as i can at the kid that just caught the pigskin. because the football god was on my side that night, mcdouche was about to catch the ball. i sprint at the little fucker as fast as i can. i avoid the first line of defense, comprised of linemen. leaning into the hit, and dropping my shoulder gets me through the second line of defense, and footwork gets me around the third. i pour on speed and anger of the entire night, waiting for him to catch the ball. mcdouche gets it, and he sprints to the right, not seeing the little ball of hate that is speeding towards him as fast as humanly possible. i saw, through his helmet, that smug little smile of his, from catching the ball, turn to a look of horror as he catches sight of me. mcdouche plants his foot and skids in fear, trying to protect the ball from the purple jersey in front of him. it's too late, i launch from a full tilt sprint, straight through the air, with my shoulders at his chest, and my helmet aimed at the ball. my metal face guard caught his hand. it was sandwiched between a football, and two sprinting football players, connecting at 20+ mph. he does a backflip, landing on his head. i slide over him, and not so gracefully sprawl across the turf behind him. i saw stars. i turn around, and he's dropped the football, curled up in pain, holding his arm. the coaches come out on the field, the games stopped, and the ambulance is called. he's crying on the field, in front of half the middle school i attended. he's humiliated. later that night, i learn that i connected with him so hard, so perfectly, that i shattered 7 bones in his hand. and i slept like a king. edit: forgot to mention it was later in the game. they scored 4th quarter, we drove ball back, and this was next kickoff.i don't know if this should go under /r/justiceporn or /r/pettyrevenge, i'll let you decide. i own and operate a delivery service delivery hot tubs, furniture, and pool tables. i've been doing about eleven years or so. like any job, it has its ups and downs and more than a fair share of conflicts. there were conflicts frequently between me and the stores i delivered for, employees and assistants i've hired, and customers who've hired me through the years. this is a tale of a bitch. a drugged out, chemically adled bitch. it was four years ago, i was doing a pool table setup near st. louis, followed by a hot tub delivery between st. louis and the lakes. as per normal, i had to collect a considerable amount of money from these customers which had to be dropped off at the business that hired me at the lake of the ozarks. i finished my last job around 6:30 p.m. and arrived at the business to drop off my collections around 8 p.m. the store, knowing how accomodating i was toward them, asked if i'd be interested in delivering a really light sofa to a town up the road. they told me it was ten miles away, turned out to be thirty, so i was a little irritated by the delay and it being in a fairly remote area near the lake, i ended up spending extra time trying to locate it after dark. i wasn't happy, considering the fact i still had a two hour drive ahead of me before arriving home. i end up finding the place. i knock on the door and discover that i've delivered during dinner time for the people. i apologize for how long it took to find them and asked if they'd like the sofa deposited in the living room or the garage. the man tells me neither and informs me that it has to go down stairs in the sun room. he shows me the stairs at which point i inform him that the delivery was a first room of the house or garage delivery (a fact they were informed about before i left the store). the man is hostile when i tell him this and says he isn't accepting the delivery unless i put it in the sun room. i inform him again that it is a garage or living room delivery, no stairs. i also inform him that it will never fit down the stairs no matter what. it is at this point that he leads me over to the side of his house and tells me that i'll have to carry it down the side or i can take it back to the store. i'm used to this tactic and any other day it might have worked, but i made a lot of money off my first two deliveries and i wasn't making very much off the sofa delivery so i'm more than happy to take it back to the store. the side of the hill he wanted me to carry sofa down in the dark was covered in rocks about the size of my head or bigger. an extremely dangerous endeavor i refuse to undertake. here's where it gets ... bizarre. i had already taken the sofa off the truck in anticipation of carrying it into the living room or the garage and it is sitting in the driveway. he thinks i'm bluffing and tells me to take the sofa back to the store. i inform him that's not a problem, but he won't be able to pick it up or return it or exchange it until the delivery fee is paid. he's already told me he wasn't paying. i reach down to grab the sofa and his wife, the woman who bought it, jumps on my back and starts clawing my face. she's raked my cheek and clawed some pretty deep furrows in the skin. in fact, i still have some faint scarring from these scratches even today. i shrug her off where she lands on the sofa, at which point, her husband threatens to kick my ass for assaulting his wife. he gets in my face, cursing at me using every curse word combination he can think of and at this point, the red neck in me moves to the forefront of brain and i stand my ground and promise them that i will plant the next person to touch me in the ground. i'm pissed beyond being professional, but still, i represent the store in this delivery so i "politely" ask him to have his wife get off the soda. by the light of the street lamp, i can see that the woman is high as a freaking kite. her eyes are glassy, her nose is red, and i can smell the pot on her and the wine she'd been drinking. she is out of it for the most part. he removes his wife from the sofa, and i reach down to grab the sofa again. i warn him to control his wife if he cares about her, and he calls me a few choice names in reply. i mentioned that the sofa was really light, so i usually just pick this model up and throw it on my shoulder and carry it where it needs to go. this time was no different except for the crazy chick. i reached down to grab it again and the woman tried to jump on my back again much to the protest of her husband. i had anticipated her doing this again and quickly snatched the sofa the driveway and quick-stepped over to the truck. she missed me completely and landed face first on the pavement fucking up her grill horribly. i mean she messed herself up horribly. she didn't stop her self with her hands before she hit. she just plowed into the pavement like she was leaping into a pool. the man gets pissed and takes a swing at me. i step back from him and move toward the front of my truck. i do this two more times with his swings going wide each time. i didn't want to fight if i could help it, so i just kept backing out of range and in doing so, i was stepping into frame for the driving cam i used to have in the cab of my truck. he tried hitting me about six more times until his wife's crying forced him to abandon his attempt at assault. i secured the sofa why he tended to his wife. i was parked on the street because his driveway was pretty steep and i had a hot tub trailer attached. he told me i better not try using his driveway to turn around or he'd drag me out of my truck and beat my ass. i inform him that the sofa, because of the late hour will be taken back to my shop and would not be released until to the store or him until the delivery fee was paid. he told me he'd be filing assault charges against me for what i did to his wife. i showed him my camera and said please do, because i had it on film. (i didn't. realized on the ride home that the camera hadn't been on.) as i was backing up the street (because they lived on a dead end street), my trailer jack-knifed into a dead snag. after pulling forward and back several times, i was able to back it up the hill and around the curve into the regular street again. it was at this point that i noticed that part of one of the limbs in the dead snagged had broken lose and landed on the shoulder of the road, which gave me an idea. i back the trailer into the dead snag a couple of times and the top of the tree broke off and blocked about two thirds of the street. i got out and with a little grunting and grubbing, i was able to pull the tree top across the street enough to block their exiting their block. it cost me a tail-light on the trailer but it was worth it. the sweet justice in this was that my shop that i was storing the sofa in was two hours away in springfield. when they finally contacted the store and i explained everything to them, the store backed me up and returned their money minus the money for the two hour delivery i charged for taking it to springfield with me. well, that was my tale of red-neck revenge. hope you liked it. tl/dr; asshole and crazy chick received sweet karma after assaulting me during delivery.so i'll start by saying that i am a jr. ref at my local (airsoft) field which i will not name just for the fact that it is going to court. anyway i'm 16 but a very respected and aggressive player. so it begins with us playing a game where you have a certain path to follow and along the path their are key objective buildings that you must capture to move your spawn closer to keep pushing up. anywho the next building we have to get is fairly large with three windows facing us one window on each side of the door. no ones pushing on our team so i decide to start it and ask for covering fire and run up to the side of the building (their were no guns shooting out of the windows at the time, this is important later) so the doors on the far right side of the building i'm on the middle left, i go to clear and shoot the guy in the right window with my shotgun. i move on to the left one and see a kid crouched facing the other way. i shoot him and then a person in the corrner that i dident see shoots me in my plate carrie with his rifle point blank (20ft engagement for 400fps) alright not too big of a deal, it happens to me a lot because i tend to scare a lot of people do they act on their instinct, i explane that is against the rule to shoot me so close with the rifle. he starts babbling on about how i can shoot people so close but he can't ect.. and how i didn't call my hits when i ran to the building (no one was even shooting when i ran) i tell him that i'll call the hit as long as he does. he says somthing and turns like he's going to walk away, but in a split second he turns points his rifle at my face and sends 5 rd burst point blank directly to my face. two getting caught by my glasses two getting caught by my shmog, and one hitting my ear causing bleeding. i point him out to the ref and what not. he talks to the owner then i get brought in for him to apologized, an i told him "i do not accept your apology on the grounds that you could have blinded me, deafened me, taken a tooth out. you assaulted me because you did not follow the rules because you decide to be an inconsiderate asswhole who could have ruined my entire future as a functioning human and you are oh so lucky i'm not sueing you" the owner said it was my call weather he gets banned or not at first i told him to not let him back for a while. then his friends who were a table away from us, started being dicks to my friends and i. so i let the owner know that i wish for him and his friends to never be allowed back. and during this time, the dude threatened a marine/army colonel (don't know for sure other than he's a colonel) that he was going to shoot him with a real gun. he didn't say it directly to him, but to his friends and their were many witnesses. so now because of that he his now being reported because of the threat, and i'm now in the process of getting him assault charges. btw this dudes 21 i'm 16. things arnt going to be well for him for a while.several years ago a major hurricane blew through my hometown and the government issued a damage repair to all houses effected by the storm after evaluation through insurance companies (something to that extent). construction contractors took advantage of the situation going door to door offering their services. contractors get money, everyone gets free repairs, why not? whole neighborhoods signed on and work began. my parents were getting their home repaired and after a time realized the amount they were quoted for was too high so they planned to break the contract and find someone else to do all the repairs and replace all the shutters and window framing for the same price. while on the phone with the contractor, he tells them they're willing to to do all the extra work for free so my parents stay with the original contractors. after many many months the work was done and the guys came to collect, except they didn't replace the shutters and window framing. my father withholds the money because they admit to lying about the extra work in order to keep the contract, but refuse to do it because they didn't write up the new contract for my dad to sign so they're not obligated to do it yet wanted our money. this devolved into arguments with them threatening to sue us. a couple days later after discussing this with the family we have them over for a meeting and agree to pay them extra but discounted amount to do the shutters and framing. they come back and finish the work. when the time came for them to receive their pay they visit the house and my mother gives them the check. they realize that the amount was for the original work without the additional pay as agreed. they get pissed. my mother snarkily replies to them that since they didn't sign a revised contract she was not obligated to pay them the extra amount. they left without much of a fight. tl;dr get it on paper. this one is an unorthodox form of revenge, though. not from the food server but instead a dismayed observer. so i'm out to dinner with some friends. and one guy, a friend of a friend, is being a particular prick. as a side note, he is known as a real penny pincher. a tight ass, so to speak. always asking for drinks, asking for handouts. and it turns out that this guy has been rorting our country's (australia) welfare system for years. i only recently found out. so here we are, at the restaurant table, and he is being racist - talking about hitler and using fake german accents in this hungarian restaurant...in front of the friendly young hungarian waitress... he is complaining about the menu, and generally being rude to this poor waitress who is obviously new to the job (a backpacker) and just being nice, whilst no doubt earning very little and not being tipped much (we don't tip as much as people in the states) so i tell him to stop being an asshole, but he won't listen. he continues... we all, as a group, scold him for being a prick, but he continues. time passes, and later, the waitress brings his dinner which consisted of chicken schnitzel and chips. at this point, we are all happy because the food is great, but of course he then decides to complain and ask the poor waitress to put the chips back in the frier because "they're not cooked enough". and to get a new soda because "it is diet, not regular" (we sip the soda and all agree he is wrong). i'd had enough. pissed off at this guys lack of empathy, most likely due to the fact he has never worked in hospitality - in fact he doesn't work at all - he relies on welfare payouts from the government, i decide to seek revenge. .... so... as soon as i got home i wrote a long detailed submission to our welfare system 'dob-in' program. it is basically a website where you can anonymously dob in welfare cheats. he's toast. i wrote everything i know about the guy, including his boasts about rorting money. i wrote his name, his address, his general m. o. (from what i've heard, etc). feels good.so, last night i heard a track that reminded me of the story of revenge i'm about to share with you guys. the track is [too many rappers]( by the beastie boys and nas. its a decent cut about poser rappers amongst other things. years ago i did a solid for a friend of a friend's friend; dj'ing for some show they were throwing i think they described it as a stop on a regional tour. so i start doing some prep work, i ask for some of their instrumentals and they're taken aback. all they had planned and wanted me to do was play their mixtape (they called it an album) while they rapped over themselves rapping. i'm not sure if i need to explain this or not, but this is amateur as fuck and definitely not hip-hop. at this point i knew it was going to be bad, but stuck with it anyway since they said they already sold like 80 tickets. it got worse. their 'album' despite having decent, probably stolen beats is embarassingly cliche. it was full of rhymes that were boastful lies, mysogyny, but worst of all uninspired and uninteresting. regardless, i work with what i can. i figured out some good mixes with my own instrumentals, marked some bars i could loop so they could freestyle or work the hype, pick out some points i can scratch with. i was ready. a few days later i get to club and set up, but there is no sound engineer. whatever, i work with the house stuff, perform checks, and get ready stressing out way too much over all this foreign equipment. the time comes for their set and for a good hour these losers were holding people at the door trying to make it look like the place was bumping, but in reality it was a ghost town. probably 6 hours after i had got there the set finally starts for an entire 30 people. the first half went as good as it can go when 3 or 4 douchebags are rapping over the sound of themselves rapping despite them looking like dear headlights when their tracks didn't end. there is a quick interlude and i decide i'm getting paid now. i knew they didn't make enough at the door to pay my full fee, but i was cool with taking a cut. they fucked up by offering me a measely sum that i can't even remember. when the second half started i kept working, kept up the professionalism, but for the last two tracks i had my fun. the second to last track i kept my hand on my turntable's pitch slider. i would speed and slow down the track subtlely. to anyone listening they probably wouldn't have noticed, but if youre singing over your own song for the umpteenth time you definitely noticed. again i give them a chance to actually be mc's with some looped instrumentals, and again they can't do it and i cringe. i queue the last track and think fuck it and change my turntable to rotate at 45 rpms instead of 33. and guess what? those broke clowns stood up there posturing to an empty house singing about how cool they were rapping their last track like chipmunks. i don't know why they didn't stop, maybe they didn't want people to know they were rapping over their own voices or they were frozen by humiliation. don't fuck over your dj, especially if you're creativly bankrupt and are a whack rapper. passion and inspiration are more important than money, but when the money is gone there is no respect.ok so some years ago (i was about 19-20 i think, now 26) a friend of mine had a free house, so a bunch of guys were gonna head over, sink some beers, smoke a little, play some vidya etc. i had just been offered a permanent position at the temp job i was working so i fancied going out for a few drinks first to celebrate, but the guys were already at the house which was in a different town. no biggie, me and my brother will head out for a few drinks, then hop on a train and come down to the house. we do, then we pick up a couple more beers at the shop (45min train ride) before heading to the station. the train is at the platform but isn't leaving for a good 20mins, so we grab a table and continue chatting. we're right at one end of the carriage, sat opposite each other, with me in the aisle seat facing down the entire length of the carriage. i see a group of younger people walking down the carriage towards me. a girl, then two guys. all dressed kinda like scene kids so i don't pay them any attention... until the girl, without skipping a step, walks past and slaps me in the forehead. i turn in my chair and start yelling expletives at her, along with my brother, but she doesn't stop. just opens the door to the next carriage and continues through. the first guy follows her out but the second guy stops at our table. starts running his mouth about 'how the fuck are you gonna start on a girl' and 'if you want a fucking fight me and my friend will be through there'. we both try to talk this guy down as we're peaceful chaps, explain that she slapped me in the face, and basically give him the opportunity to walk away. but no, the tirade of yelling continues - we'll fuck you up, don't fucking talk to girls like that, yadda yadda yadda. later conversations with people about this have pretty much confirmed that the guy was on cocaine - firstly because of his mr. invincible attitude, and secondly because of the sizeable chunk of white/brown stuff that had formed in the corner of his mouth. in an attempt to defuse the situation, my brother pointed it out and said "dude, you've got something on your lip there" to which we both chuckle... he responds by spitting at us. remember i said we were peaceful guys? yeah, line crossed unfortunately. we're also both over six foot tall and i think i'm about 13st (180lbs) - my brother is bigger still. we both jump up from our seats and he finds himself face to face with me - i swear i saw him visibly shrink, quite impressive as he was already a little runt. i think the realisation of what he had done finally sank in. after a quick mental rundown of "ok, so you've stood up, he spat at you, what do we do now?" i leaned backwards and launched my forehead square into his nose. blood exploded everywhere, and as he staggered backwards i caught his nose again with a left hook (not gonna front, my hand hurt for days afterwards. but god it was worth it) he collapsed into a seat, clutching his face... while his friend came back into the carriage to get him, shaking in both himself and his voice, apologising profusely for both of his friends. as i said, we're peaceful guys so i didn't go for him - i said not to worry cos he hadn't done anything, but i pointed behind him at the girl and said "you should bring her in here, see what she's caused" we bounced off the train after that. managed to get back to our house, where my brother's gf was having a night in with her sister, who i had never met before. brilliant first impression - explaining the story and then holding out my red-stained palms, saying "that's his blood" hahahahain college, roommates friend was this pot smoking indian dude that was a total backstabbing dickbag. he would do the most underhanded shit, talk behind everyone's back. hit on our girlfriends, never buy a round of drinks. just a typical dirtbag, but ofcourse yea we smoked out with him. go figure. anyway heres the revenge story: he took allot of pride in his appearance, too much cologne, and his parents always gave him money so he could buy fresh gear. all of us were having a simple conversation that turned to talking about teeth whitener. he started cracking way too many cold jokes about me and my roommates bad breath in front of these ladies that we just met. that night, girls ditch us because of his shit talk about some other stuff you just dont say to woman you are interested in, a total cockblock. it was time for revenge. this what we did. one night that he was confirmed out of his apartment, we smashed the back window of his apartment one night. he told us about it, and that he thinks someone tried breaking into his place but nothing was stolen. he was a bit paranoid and talking all this shit about how he has a gun and will shoot a motherf'r. etc. he is like 90 pounds wet, no muscles. the seed was planted. about a week later, he tells us that he went his mailbox and there was an envelope in his box with just a picture of a toothbrush and with magic marker "remember the date: 5/17/97" . please note i changed the date, it was a date in the future 2 weeks, basically." he made a big deal about this at parties and stuff when we would start a conversation during a smokeout session about weird events, or sightings. he would get thrilled to tell everyone this story. a week later, we put another two pictures in his mailbox: it was a pic of his bathroom, with his toothbrush clearly seen hanging there. the next pic is the toothbrush handle hanging out the rear end of someone's very hairy buttcheeks. yes, for two weeks straight we would hang with him: play video games or whatever.. go off and take a piss. shove his toothbrush up our asses. he never found out who did it. nor did he ever ask. during a smokeout session, we brought up our favorite conversation weird things that we seen, heard, etc. it's his turn to speak up... since he is not saying anything. so we ask him if he has anything to contribute to the conversation? he's like "naa, man i ain't got nothing." giggles, all around. my friend almost lost his shit laughing.. but blamed it on the weed. ***tl;dr version up top: hunter moore the revenge porn king was probably relieved when he got arrested.*** story at link [here]( but i'm posting the text below for quicker viewing. *if it's in italics then it's something i added* by: bullyville founder every day, both kids and adults experience online bullying. awareness may be up, but unfortunately so are the incidents of harassment. how many more tortured young kids will choose to take their own lives, rather than face the insecure bullies who get pleasure from ruining theirs? hunter moore from the now defunct isanyoneup.com is probably one of the internet’s most notorious offenders. hunter is a self-admitted bully with a long history of outrageous behavior. on abc nightline, he proclaimed to be a “professional life ruin-er.” when confronted by the village voice about a pending fbi investigation against him, moore stated the following. "i will literally fucking buy a first class fucking plane ticket right now, eat an amazing meal, buy a gun in new york and fucking kill whoever said that. i will burn down fucking the village voice headquarters if you fucking write anything saying i have an fbi investigation." and lets not forget about his comment to gawker during an interview, and i quote, “i’m gonna sound like the most evil motherfucker-let’s be real for a second: if somebody killed themselves over being on the site do you know how much money i’d make? at the end of the day, i do not want anybody to hurt themselves. but if they do? thank you for the money.” back in april of this year, i convinced hunter to shut down his now infamous “isanyoneup.com” revenge porn website for a nominal fee. hunter was so convincing that he was going to turn over a new leaf and be an advocate against bullying, especially underage bullying. within 72 hours of that transaction being complete, hunter was on twitter cyber bullying kids worse than ever before. telling kids that they should “kill themselves” using vulgar, racist language and advocating more violence and revenge. i should have known that his attention would eventually turn to me. and turn it did. moore, starved for attention, went on an online rampage accusing me (amongst other things) of being a pedophile. i was with my wife and two baby boys when his defamatory tweets came through. i shudder to think what the marine in me might have done if hunter was standing right in front of me. but you know what, that’s not the right answer; violence is a weak medicine when fighting a bully like hunter moore. i took the high road and didn’t even bother to respond. instead of making an anger fueled decision, i studied moore. once i looked for his weaknesses, they were easy to find, #brainsoverbullies. moore’s world revolves around his twitter account. it was horrifying to see how many of his followers retweeted his defamatory comments with even nastier ones. and then came the straw that broke the camel’s back. as if accusing me of pedophilia wasn’t bad enough, hunter moore threatened to rape my wife while my kids watched. he has now been served with a defamation lawsuit and has restraining orders filed against him in two states. he can add this to his ever growing criminal record. anyone who retweeted hunter’s pedophile comments and added their own can also expect to be served with a defamation lawsuit. ”internet tough guys” are also legally accountable for their actions. hunter and some of his followers now realize this, along with their parents since some of his followers appear to be under the age of 18. you would think that hunter would have learned his lesson about receiving naked photos of possibly underage girls on his twitter account or via email after the fbi raided his house (actually his parents’ house since he still lives at home, he's 26) but apparently not. here at bullyville, we’ve decided to turn this darkness into light. we’ll soon be launching a brand new site for isanyoneup.com (*this didn't seem to come to fruition*) that not only shows the history and eventual dismantling of this disturbing website, but also brings valuable information to people who have been wronged by similar behavior. we are also putting together a class action lawsuit against hunter, on behalf of all the victims from isanyoneup or any other social media that he used to directly harass and intimidate people. we’re doing this mostly for the completely powerless, underage women who were verbally harassed after hunter posted their completely naked, unedited photos on his site. hunter moore pissed me off long before he came after me and my family because he picked on those who he thought couldn’t fight back. i tried to use positivity to stop that, and i actually (naively) thought it worked. now that he’s crossed the line with his personal attacks against me and my family, there’s no turning back, i won't let him. i once believed that a stint in the military might be a good option to get hunter back on track, but unfortunately, he became ineligible after his recent arrest for head butting a woman in a nightclub in new york. and that sums up what kind of bully he is. he preys on those who he perceives as weak, but this time he’s not getting away with it. do i have your undivided attention hunter? do you clearly understand what is happening to you right now? i’m standing up to a bully, and that bully is you. sometimes you have to be a bully to beat a bully. i’m reclaiming the innocence you so recklessly stole from these innocent young girls whose lives you’ve destroyed. strong people stand up for themselves but the strongest people stand up for others. i’m really looking forward to seeing you in court as are some of the underage girls who you’ve publicly tormented. all of the money that we win from these multiple lawsuits against you will be donated to battered women’s shelters across the united states. let this serve as a constant reminder to you that it’s never right, under any circumstance, to hit or disrespect a woman. now i realize that you don’t have any money, but after we win these judgments against you, any money you do earn in the future will go towards this charity. so you just go right ahead and launch that new website that you keep telling everyone about. october 31st (*2012*), right hunter? your "investors" might as well just write a check to our charity because that's exactly where their money will be going when we're done with you. oh, and the only thing you have left– your beloved social media, that’s going away too. your isanyoneup twitter account is going to be shut down shortly – and i’m 100% responsible for that. you see hunter, you’re violating the trademarks that i now have in place for isanyoneup and iau. you might want to go read the fine print of that contract you signed. remember your lifetime ban from facebook? well that also includes any other page you try to hide behind, including your current iau2 community facebook page, say goodbye to that as well. by the way hunter, when you’re retweeting the completely nude photos of girls, are you verifying that each one of them is at least 18 years of age? i didn’t think so; add that to your list of problems for today. you might want to go familiarize yourself with federal penal code 18 usc sect 2255. and hunter your tweet about “leaking emails” between the two of us during the acquisition of your website would be so welcomed. assuming you don’t create fake email interactions, which you’ve done in the past, you will be violating, yet again, the terms of the agreement which included a confidentiality clause. any rational person doesn’t believe a word that comes out of your mouth, including the amount you’re claiming to your “fans” and the media that your revenge porn website was purchased for. once again hunter you’re on the main stage. enjoy yet another 15 minutes of infamy, it will most likely be your last. karma is right around the corner anxiously awaiting your arrival. this will be the last time i speak to you directly hunter. i’m sure you’re going to have some unbelievably intelligent public tweets/lies since you’re a literary genius. looking forward to you supplying additional evidence so the world can see for themselves just who you really are. as benjamin disraeli once said, "courage is fire and bullying is smoke." *there's a bit more after this, but the end result is the evidence this guy gathered and posted in this article led to a $250,000 judgement against the hunter moore, and this was all a while before he was arrested by the feds.*i grow weed for a living, and in this business we tend to hire by invitation only. when i first started, i was invited by a "friend" and for the sake of anonymity we'll call him jason. since i had to quit my part-time job, quit school and travel out of state for this opportunity, jason let me live with him and his girlfriend while he was supposedly "showing me the ropes." for nearly two years straight, i went to work with jason every single day, including holidays. we would hop into his loud, obnoxious, cop-magnet of a car (what we were doing wasn't exactly legal) and drive to each grow site, which took anywhere from a few hours up to an entire day if we had to harvest. in two years, jason taught me nothing. he delegated all the hard work to me, and blamed me for anything that went wrong even though we basically had the same responsibilities. our boss had already fired a couple of guys because they couldn't get along with him. i refused to let that happen to me, because i knew the marijuana industry was getting bigger, and i was determined to get my piece of the pie. for two years straight, i put up with his shit, kept my mouth shut, worked incredibly hard, and essentially risked my life with this asshole while teaching myself how to grow good weed. i could go on forever about the things this fucktard did, but you get the point. luckily, my boss was paying attention, and offered me a partnership in california, where i'm originally from. this was the big leagues of the marijuana business, and my time had come. jason was forced to maintain the operation out of state for another six months until he eventually asked for the same deal. he was now a partner as well. things got out of hand fast for jason. his abilities as a marijuana grower were becoming more apparent with each crop. the yield kept getting lower. his place always seemed to look improperly maintained. he couldn't keep track of what he was doing over the course of several weeks, and we would have to figure out solutions to his problems. after another year of this nonsense i decided enough was enough. i devised a plan to subtly plant the idea in my partner's mind that jason was embezzling. i told a close friend to keep an eye on him for me and let me know what he does, since she hangs out with his girlfriend every now and then. i would hear stories about jason going to music festivals, and then exaggerate the cost of the tickets (not that i really had to since they're expensive as fuck anyway) and i would even suggest that he went partying some nights even when i knew he didn't. and with each little drop of poison to jason's name i added into my partner's ear, there would be a phone call made to jason about progress at work, which usually led to a heated conversation about his usefulness to the company and other shortcomings. i went at this for months, until he finally agreed that jason should be kicked out of the business. i felt like andy dufresne escaping shawshank after having just crawled through a river of shit. as an added bonus, my partner was entitled to half of jason's equipment after we kicked him out, about $7000 worth... all of which was offered to me for free. **tl;dr** lazy dumbfuck is a constant pain in the ass while i'm a lowly employee; i become my own boss and start a chain of events that leads to his subsequent unemployment. edit: i think i have to remind everyone that it is legal to grow marijuana in california depending on where you live. and although marijuana possession and cultivation is still a federal crime, i think reddit would agree that those laws will inevitably change.i was laid off temporarily one winter. during my off time, i got a phone call from a guy i knew a few years earlier. kind of a good-for-nothing, but generally harmless. he told me he'd started a painting business, and had a huge contract, and could use any help he could get, fast, and knew i was off and might want some work. he was based out of a city about 70 miles away, so he said i could stay with him if i wanted, he's got room. so i took him up on it. i get there, and the guy doesn't have a truck, and asks if we can use mine. his is "in the shop" - total bs, he didn't even have one, but i didn't know that yet. we go to the first house to paint(he really did have a contract to paint several houses), and he points me to where he'd like me to start. i have painting experience and he knows it, so i don't need a lot of supervision. but i don't notice him doing anything at all. just going to the bathroom every 15 minutes or so. well it becomes obvious pretty fast, guy's got himself a coke problem. to the point where he can't do any work, just gotta inhale powder all day. now i don't begrudge a man his substances, coke, weed, acid, alcohol, whatever, as long as you're meeting your responsibilities, and not dragging down others around you. over the next couple of weeks he hired a couple more people who came and went, and didn't get paid for their short stints. but both those people were, to be fair, absolutely terrible, and caused more damage than they were worth, so not paying them was reasonable. over those couple of weeks, when he'd get good and high, he'd get talkative(as blow tends to do to a person), and he'd let slip how he can't have any utilities in his name, cause he owes them all hundreds or even thousands of dollars - phone, internet, electricity, water, gas, even car insurance somehow - the works. he's got a good girl gina at home, who's pretty sick of this shit, but is too nice and trying to fix him instead of helping herself. so everything's in her name. so a couple of weeks go by, i do my work impeccably every day, and it's time to get paid. there's no money to pay me. he's making excuses about how he didn't get some money the customer had promised, like i'm too stupid to see where the money really went. anyway, i had nothing else to do, so i worked another week, listening to his promises that i'd be paid the next friday(the end of 3 weeks or work). sure enough, friday came and there's no money to pay me(but there's been blow every day for 3 weeks now). so, i leave. i'm not working for free. and for revenge on getting 3 weeks of work out of me for free, i sent an anonymous letter to every utility he owed money to, telling them where to find him. he immediately had collectors on his doorstep, filing summonses against him, for thousands of dollars. plus, with me not doing any work, the customers went from being impatient with how slowly work was being done, to firing him for breach of contract. good girl gina had enough and dumped him. he had to leave town pretty much immediately. he had no vehicle either, so packed a bag and hitch hiked out of town. last i heard, he was in and out of rehab, still a junkie(about 10 years later), and still going from town to town burning bridges and only concerned about his next high.when i was in fifth grade, i was always getting picked on. it was bad, but there was this one kid, he shall be named justin, who was a demon. i would draw trees in class after the lesson was over. justin picked up on this and would take to calling me a tree fag. he did stuff like this all the time. during winter i would wear some cheap green gloves, and i was dubbed booger fingers. i didn't tell the proper authorities because that usually made it worse. although i did become friends with the principal. i tried to become friends with him, and he would burp one of those horrible burps that smelled like trash juice in my face. one day, about a week till school was out for summer, i had had enough. i got one of those wood pencils, sharpened it to a point, and waited till we were on the way to the bus. they had to dig about an inch of pencil lead from his back. when the principal had made a show out of taking me to his office, he got this look on his face like "why?", and told me to next time punch him. i was suspended the next day and no charges were made by the parents.to begin with english is not my first language so be prepared for some silly mistakes. second, some of my memories of this event is a bit hazy, if there is any questions about how things were i'll try to explain them. the entire event took place in a month, but my revenge happened over a weekend. this was in the autum of 09, i think. i was born 95 and my brother 94. but since he had skipped a year in elementary school to be with his friends, we were in the same age group altough we went to the same school we never were the same class. it all began in high-school. anyhow, facebook had made its great entrance among minors so both of us had facebook accounts. at that time i was a social recluse, a anxious anime nerd who had a few friends and a perfect target for practical jokes, which my brother knew. thus i was "faceraped" (for those of you who are unfamiliar with facerapes it's when someone posts statuses on another persons account, its often quite silly and obvious). this was not much of a big deal, i "faceraped" him back so to teach him a lesson, but he didn't learn much from it as i found myself "faceraped" once again. this was enough i thought. time to end this silliness, but only how? that's when death note makes its appearance. it's an anime, in great simplification, about two people locked in a battle of wits. as i watched it, all became clear for me. i now knew how i was going to get my revenge. i was going to out wit him so greatly that he would not dare to mess with my facebook again. the first step in the plan was to get access to my brothers facebook account, so i was in need of his e-mail and his password. i got the perfect opportunity for this when we, one friday, were at our grandparents place, he wanted to check his facebook on their computer so i simply axelsurfed his password, easy. his e-mail would need some wit. i asked him if he could help me install the e-mail feature in my ipod, after some arguing i got him to use his e-mail to unlock it (apparently my e-mail "didn't work") now for the detailes. i asked my brother for a good movie to download, he happily adviced me to se the movie x and he also included the websites y where i could download it. now i had everything i needed. as soon as i were alone i logged into his facebook form my ipod, good thing they had wifi there. there i wrote something like this: "hello monsieur [last name]. thank you for downloading movie x from website y. i am now in full controll of your computer. love from france." this was not the actual message but i made some deliberate spelling and grammar mistakes to make the frenchman more realistic. after i wrote this on my ipod, i logged him out and logged into facebook with my own account. i scrolled down to my own message, made a poorly acted chuckle and showed it to my brother. needles to say he was freaked out. he instantly went onto the computer and deleted the message, sadly. the good thing was that he didn't change the password, he decided that he would do that when we came home. since i still could acces his account i kept my poor pokerface and let a half hour go by. then i wrote something like this: "monsieur [last name] why would you remove my last message? i just want to get along! you really hurt my feelings, do you really have to be this mean?" waited and showed him. he got stressed and deleted the message and told our mom that we should go home asap. two birds with one stone. once at home my brother immediately changed the password, which i had feared. this was his great misstake, the password he now had was quite strange, so strange that he wrote it on a paper to remember it, a paper i definatly could take a peek at. my brother searched for viruses, defragmented the computer and other stuff as well as he fiddled with his account. i locked myself inside my room, this was ordinary practice for me and my family allowed a teenager have that privacy. in my room i could barely contain my excitement. i wasted no time to create a fake frenchman. the name of the man would obviously be jaquille (there's not a single more french name then that!) i then checked for normal surnames. i decided with dubois, the third most normal surname, in case my brother would search for this man. then i looked for pictures of french men, as usually i took several steps to make him more realistic. meanwhile some of my brothers classmates had picked up what was happening to my brother and asked things like: "hey, frenchy, you there?" on my brothers profile. i was quite close to dying in my attempts to not tell anyone who the frenchman really were. later that night i snuck into my brothers room and got the password, this was when the turd would hit the fan. i changed his entire profile, where jaquille lived, where he went to school, changed his profile picture and so on. oh, and jaquille was furious: "mr [last name] i have had enought of you! do you really think that defragmenting, searching for viruses and changing the password will stop me?! i am greatly insulted by you! i only sought to be your friend, and you treat me like this! you really ought to be ashamed of yourself! no love - jaquille dubois" i also replied to his classmates, to their great joy. forward to the morning and all hell broke loose. my brother when compleatly nuts on his computer, he changed admin, the passwords to the profiles, deleted all his movies anything to get rid of jaquille, which i mocked him for publicly. this went on the entire day, he made somewhat desperat attempts to get rid of jaquille, and got his attempts ridiculed publicly. luckily he didn't try to change his password again, i guess he thought jaquille would found it out anyway. next day, sunday, was when the bubble would pop. i had to pop it. my brother had decided to reformat his computer, he would lose everything on it. i thought it would no longer be just about revenge then. i revealed myself on my brothers account, to everyones joy. my family all burst out laughing when i exposed the truth, even my brother was quite amused by it. but the greatest thing was how i was received by my school on the monday. people whom i didn't even know shouted encouraging things me, which was quite of the contrast to my usual day in school. the legacy of jaquille still lives on. from that monday no one dared to mess with me and whenever my brother threatens to do something to me i calmly reminds him of "the frenchman"i'm not sure if this belongs here or not, but after having read some of these, i think it does. so in middle school, i was a stereotypical nerd. i was in the band, did well in my classes, etc. unfortunately , i had a bully as well. the guy did all sorts of crap; thankfully it never escalated to anything physical. long story short, he made my life hell for years. on of his antics was constantly taking my pencils. i knew they were mine, and my teachers knew they were mine, but we couldn't ever get proof. so, i decided to change that. one day, i wrote on a piece of paper "this is g_dawg1997's pencil." i promptly folded it up and stuck it in the pencil. (i should note i use mechanical pencils.) anyway, per usual, he took it. when i noticed, i asked to see it. he said no initially, but for some reason eventually let me have it. wrong move. over his protests, i took off the end of the pencil and pulled out the note, and then handed it to the teacher. he ended up in a fair amount of trouble once the school principal realized that the guy wasn't such an angel. it felt great.for a while, we've allowed posts that don't really involve revenge because we'd like to be fairly hands off and let people up or downvote posts, according to what they think of the revenge. posts that don't include revenge do generate reports and complaints, which we notice, but the posts still get upvoted. we're open to changing what's allowed but we'd like to know what people really think. going off of the ratio of upvotes to comments, it seems the silent majority is content with the non-revenge posts, and the vocal minority doesn't like them. obviously the silent majority may not reply here, but we'd like to know what everyone thinks. edit: the mods have discussed this and we'll be moderating posts more strictly from now on, to reflect the rules. i'm not a fighter. i never have been. i had a close "friend" (we'll call him black eye) back in college who would fight every time he drank. more often than not, he would be picking fights with his closest friends, including me. i'm a happy drunk, so i'm even less violent when having a jolly old time. this story has little to do with him, but that's the friend circle i was in. one of them was a beast of a wrestler, yet the nicest guy you'd ever meet. they were genuinely good friends, but they were really just fun to party with - on the good nights. one day, him, his macho friends, and i are at the neighbor girls' party. beer pong, sorority chicks, alpha males, and me. the party starts getting rowdy. the cops come. they id a few people but all is well in the world and they just make people leave. no big deal, our group walks two doors down to black eye's apartment. three people from the party come as well. we're having fun playing drinking games and whatnot. at one point, i go to grab my galaxy s4 from the tv. no phone. i immediately have a mini heart attack and ask someone to call it. i had just been using it. the volume is all the way up. everyone goes quiet, no ring. we all know exactly what happened. macho friends and i run out the front door and continue calling. i recall that one of the other guys went out back to "call his gf." we run around the apartment building. before turning the corner, black eye calls it again. sure enough, that boring generic samsung ringtone goes off behind his apartment. thanks to the light, we see it sitting in the grass 15 feet from guy pretending to be on phone. as in, he literally had his phone up to his ear while the screen was showing the home page. we call him out on it. "come on man. free beer and you steal my phone?" he freezes up completely. all he can say is "what? what?" he did not say another word. he just kept freezing and asking "what?" macho men starts getting in his face. i'm not going to stop anything. one more time, he stutters and asks, "wha-". black eye punches him in the face. it was so fast (and i was intoxicated enough) that i actually did not see the punch even though i was staring him in the face. he doesn't move. blood drips out of his mouth. i'm still not a fighter, and i'm not close with that circle anymore. t was definitely mildy satisfying to see instant karma though. "wha?" he leaves. we go inside. one girl realizes her phone is missing too. we call it and are happy to hear it ringing in a drawer. she swears she didn't put it there (why would she?). we ask the guy's two friends to leave. i fly home that weekend. my old buddies told me that all those guys brought a few other guys to come kick their asses. this time phone thieves and their buddies get beat. you may be under the impression that it's possible he didn't steal it. he was the only person who had left the apartment (there was only 7 of us) since i put my phone down ~10 minutes before. it was him. tl;dr: someone steals my phone. macho friend punches him. guy tries to bring a possy a few nights later. they all get beat. i don't like violence, but instant karma is a delight to witness.okay so i'm not sure if this is pro enough for you so if it isn't then feel free to tell me and i will put it under petty revenge. okay this story starts off when i moved overseas to study in an international college. i was staying in the school's hostel in my final year, however, due to my young age, the room i was assigned was for really young students and delinquents. this was so that the corridor could be watched over by supervisors. now i was the only "young person" there, everyone else in my sector were delinquents and unfortunately, it turns out they pulled some strings so a 3-4 of them were close friends that chose rooms beside each other. they were the worst fucking neighbours i ever had. every other night meant wall rumbling and sex noises, my table would shake and the paper thin plaster walls did not hide anything my neighbour wanted to do. without fail every 2 am i would be disturbed by drunken laughter or angry screams. walking back to my room wasn't easy either. they were big older russians (about 4-5 years older) students that were there to literally flunk classes. every day was a new adventure, be it dirty piles of laundry left outside their room to navigate through, spilt bottles of alcohol that seeped into my room. loud drunk people banging on random doors and walls and picking fights with cleaners or even broken chairs and lights left in the corridor to be cleaned up. now all this i figured i could live through, it wasn't a big deal for me, exams were pretty far away and i wore plugs to deal with the noise. this all changed in the last few months of my stay there. one day i hear the usual laughter and shouting in the room beside me. after a while i hear a knock on my door. opening it, it seems that the door was rigged so that upon opening it a bottle of piss would tip over and drain into my room. cue fast hands and panic as i desperately grabbed the bottle and stopped about half of it from spilling. i spend the next 30 mins cleaning myself and hands but the piss smell was terrible. it seemed that this "prank" was planned for a long time because the concoction was painful to breathe in. after cleaning my hands off, i took the half empty piss bottle, cleaned and capped it. and set it on my table. it was at that moment. when my room was smelly as fuck and i knew the it would be so for the next few days until the cleaners came to clean my room. it was then did i decide i had enough of his shit. so i kept the bottle, left it on my table as a constant reminder to the pain i suffered that day, the smell sealed inside i began gathering everything i could think of to create the worst revenge imaginable. first off was a trip to my friends room. my friend was a pretty messy guy and often had all sorts of moldy crap inside his room. one of those such things was a mixing bottle. the bottle was intended for fresh juice to be squeezed into it but my friend hadn't bothered to take a 3 week old lemon out from the jar causing it to fester. i took that. next i went online and searched for as many stink. i bought some basic stink bombs at first. then lady revenge saw my plight and a few weeks later, i had found out my friend had purchased butyric acid for shits and giggles online. i took that from him too. now i didn't want to mix this up too early or my own room would stink. unfortunately, me waiting too long ruined a part of my revenge. of the 4 people that were together, 3 of them had left or moved out of the hostel. thus only one was left. and he was to be the sole victim of my hatred. so the time came and i mixed it all up. a few weeks before he and i were to leave (we had the same supervisor and i was really friendly with her while he was not), leaving it in my toilet which had a really powerful airvent. i let it sit for a few days and all this time, i had kept the bottle of piss with me half empty on my table. it would be the last piece of my plan. now came plan b. i was afraid that i might not have time or would chicken out from the main quest, and since i had spare stink bombs that i hadn't used in the final product, i decided to go through with plan b anyway. spying on him, i learnt of the times he would leave his laundry in the laundry room or go to dinner. i took the extra stink bombs, and for three simultaneous washes, i dropped them in with his washing. i like to think that his clothes were fucked from three washes and 2 dry spins. i would never know. so back to the concoction finally after 2 whole days of festering, i poured it into the bottle. making my own modifications to the bottle (i chopped off the top to allow the entire thing to spill immediately. i poured and stirred. god the smell was horrifying...but so beautiful. as i stared at the bottle, i knew the time was right, he would be stuck in that room for the next few days and there wouldn't be cleaners around as the holidays were about to begin. ironically, a few days before, the supervisor came to wish me goodbye in advance as she was leaving first and asked me whether my neighbour was a nice neighbour as she also knew he was a delinquent. i had told her i had no problem with him and so we left on good terms. as a final i would say cherry on top. i peed a bit into the bottle as my mark of revenge. back to the revenge. i placed it at his door but with my own mix, i attached the bottle to a piece of string which i strapped to his doorknob, upon opening, the string would drag the bottle over tipping the entire thing into the room. i did my work when i tracked him to be inside the room after his dinner and banged on the door furiously to get him worked up enough to swing open the door as fast as possible. it went better than expected, after hiding i heard a loud scream before a slam, a sound of the door opening again and then a louder scream. i could hear him charge around shouting something in russian before going back to his room. success. as i approached my room once again the smell hit me, lucky for me i was ready, a few days before i had borrowed a large fan to be placed in my room from another friend (summer hits hard with no ac) and so the smell didn't waft into my room for long. i could see the large stain left all over the floor. laughing to myself i went to my room and rested. now fast forward a few days later. eventually the guy did everything with his room door open to allow the smell out. walking past the large stain left behind showed me the damage done. the spill had effectively flown inwards (fortunately for me) and gotten over a whole bundle of his clothes i believe he was packing(which he dumped at the foot of his door). i would see him walking around looking pissed as hell. sometimes if i sat close to him in the canteen i could still smell the stank permeating from his skin. i guess he wasn't that well of a scrubber. i spilt about 500ml of stinky ass liquid into his room, 300ml of it was his own piss and very little of mine. he stayed in that room for another 2-3 weeks before all of us parted ways. my final glee was at the end of everything, he came up to me as i was leaving, asking to speak with me. in broken english he asked if i saw anyone throw the bottle of piss into his room. i shrugged my shoulders and feigned ignorance. as i loaded my luggage onto the bus, i saw him walking to the canteen so i screamed as the bus passed by the hostel and left to the airport. "thanks for the bottle of piss, i left it at your door!" i hoped that was enough for him to understand what it meant. i like to think it was though probably not since english wasn't his first language. tl;dr russian neighbour makes my life a living hell and the final straw is spilling piss all over me and my room, i take what he gave me and threw it back with mine and a bit more.i didn't do this but one of my guy friends did. when i was in high school we had this handicap kid in a wheel chair who thought that just because he was in a wheel chair you couldn't touch him. he was always in trouble for sexual harassment and shit like that. he even propositioned me once in a very disgusting way to which i replied "oh hun, you'd fall in love and i'd fall asleep." he got so mad, but didn't try anything else, probably because it was common knowledge that if you screwed with me, my 'brothers' would find you. well, i told one of my guy friends about what he said and he was upset. he told some of his guy friends and so on and so forth until they had a group of people who were tired of this kids shit. he harassed their girl-friends and/or female-friends and talked shit and despite his many many write ups for sexual harassment, the school refused to do anything besides send him to 'sensitivity' training. i guess my complaint was just the straw that broke the camels back because the next thing i know, they've done something about him. now i have to explain one thing to you. our school had a 'grand staircase' which was basically a huge stair case with a landing in the middle and 12+ steps on either side of the landing. so these guys, my friend included, corner him in between classes, pick him and his wheel chair up, put him on this landing and left him. he was there for over an hour, i think 3 but it i'm not sure, he was there in-between class changes and not a single person did anything to help him, not one. a school of over 2,000 students who use that staircase as their main mod to get from first to second floor and not one person did a damn thing. i even walked passed him and laughed, then walked away. he had to wait until a teacher found him and got other teachers to help get him on solid ground. my friends never got in trouble for it, i'm not sure why, i think it was because he couldn't really identify them by name. after that, anytime he tried shit, all you had to do was say "staircase" and he'd go white and shit himself. **edit** when i say "sexual harassment" i mean he was notorious for not only making the most disgusting comments but grabbing girls butts, breast and groins (yes, groin), slapping their asses, lifting their skirts and shirt. i mean the foulest stuff that would have gotten you kicked out but because the school didn't want anyone to get butthurt, they didn't.story starts in '95 or '96. i was in hs and was going with some close girlfriends to a very close guy friends house for new years. needless to say, lots of drinks, and for a 110lb hs kid a whole bottle of jack put me out. my then, very close male friend 'ryan' told me i could pass out in his room. all was good as 'ryan' had always been straight with me, or so i thought. so, i went into his room alone, and closed the door. i was enveloped with quiet and darkness, the perfect mix to sleep off the over consumption of alcohol. skip ahead an undetermined amount of hours. i start come around to the sound of our mutual friend 'cory' yelling through the door. "dude, don't do this. you know this is fucked up. just stop, you know it's wrong". i look up to see what i thought was a close friend, 'ryan'. i freaked, and pushed him off. i tried to pretend it never happened, like i do all my problems. a few weeks later i find out that 'ryan' really liked me, and it wasn't just taking advantage of a drunk girl thing for him. that is when i got my plan for revenge, however i never would have thought it would be so great. 'ryan' actually had the nerve to ask me out, i said yes. i went out with him, i laughed at his jokes. my friends wondered wtf i was doing, i never told any of them that it was all in my plan. one day i heard from 'cory's' girlfriend (who was my best friend) that 'ryan' had told him he was in love with me. that was my que. the next night me and 'ryan' had plans to go out and i had my ultimate revenge ready. 'ryan' shows up, to go out. i say nothing as i get into the car. in the pause he starts crying, and says his mom just found out she has 6 months to live, that her cancer was far more advanced then they thought. i think to myself, no fucking way this could play out any better. so i look him in the face, with no emotion, and tell him "i never even liked you, we're done". i figured this would cause at most some minor hs heartbreak and several months of pain. it wasn't until 15 yrs later that i seen how deep i had cut him. we ended up working at the same place, and i came to find out he married a girl, that looks like me, talks like me and has my same name. normally the name thing wouldn't be a big deal if i had a name like amanda or brittney, but i have a ver unusual name. found out when he got drunk at the company xmas party that he is still in love with me. i hope he wallows around in it until he dies, fuck him!this didn't happen to me, but i think the story is too perfect to not share. at school i lived in an apartment that's been passed down in our fraternity, so we all know each other and have stories shared from the past. well, a few years ago one of the roommates was notorious for leaving his dishes in the sink and never doing dishes. not a guy my older roommates hated and wanted out, just an annoying thing he did. well, one day they had enough of the shit. it was a 4 person apartment. the other 3 bought paper plates, utensils, bowls, everything and decided to only use those disposable ones. they didn't let the 4th roommate know about this. well after a couple weeks the sink started getting really filled. roommate #4 came into the living room one day while they were watching tv and said something along the lines of "man, the sink is really getting filled... someone should do the dishes." at which point they made the big reveal that the dishes all could only be his. he was pissed for a short bit, but it got the point across and it's a great story now.disclaimer: this is not my revenge and isnt as good as the last one story: this is the same guy as my other post. he is a landscaper and he doesn't like not getting paid. he did some work for a lawyer, i think it was around two or three weeks of work and the lawyer was very pleased, and got lots of compliments from his neighbors. it was the talk of the street at the time. however the lawyer didnt pay up... revenge: like i have mentioned the landscaper doesn't like not getting paid. he decided to make a point and show the lawyer up. he parked and old caravan on the guys lawn with a sign saying "pay me!" when the lawyer asked what was going on he said "me and my family wont be able to pay the mortgage because you wont pay me, we are just going to live here with you" lets just say he got paid the next day.about a month ago my bike got stolen with lock and all. the moment when i walked out of the library i knew there was something wrong because i didn't see any in the neigbourhood that even remotly looked like a mountain bike. as i was panicking my burger started to fall out of my mouth, because of the sheer suprise that someone would steal a bike with 2 locks on it in the middle of the city where everyone can see. i asked one of the security gaurd that worked near the place of the crime, if he has seen someone stealing a mountainbike? his answer was something in the lines of this, "the chance that you will get your bike back is small, due to the fact that people steal bikes with locks and just puts in a truck and sells it poland or something." except the fact that guy had a bias view on polish people he seemed like a straight up guy that wouldn't be bullshitting me. i proceed to walks home instead of pressing charges in defeat, pondering if i should be an asshole and steal one for myself (didn't do it. didn't want to that jackass). a month passes by, and it's my birthday (so the 10th of december) in the evening i went to watch the premiere of the last hobbit movie (which in my opinion was way better than the other two) as we're walking from the movie my friend, and i roll a spliff and start smoking as we're walking home. as we turn around the corner into a street that's usually calm eventhough it's next to a street that has like 10 bars. in the corner of my eyes i can see a shape that looks quite familiar. i check it out and there it is! my bike in its grace &amp; glory. i recognized it imiidiatly cause i had this bike for over 5 years now and it was quite an expensive and sturdy mountain bike that you don't see that often in my city. plus it had the kinks, scratches and dent that i was responsible for through the years. as i inspect further i can see that the thief put on a new light a new seat, and he got new brakes (very nice!) as i notify my friend we both agree to smoke the jay first and call the cops after. but we had one issue, the bike was locked, and i didn't have proof that it was mine, cause you see, i got it as a gift from my neigbour, and my neigbour got it from a friend of his. the neigbour never used it due to the fact that he already had a bike. and it would've been quite helpful if the the orginal owner was still alive. and if you don't have proof that the bike is yours, then you don't have shit to show to the police. as i start panicking, my proceeds to call the police to notify them about the situation. they will reply with that they will be there withing 15 min, since it's not a urgernt matter. my friend then calls up his dad. who is in a very high position within the police force. he tells him the story and tells him exactly what to do in this situation. i don't know what the fuck is going on, but he looks quite happy and he doesn't tell me shit except that everything will be fine. the police came on time and we tell them the situation. the police couldn't do much since i didn't have proof that it was eventhough they did believe because of how precise i was with mentioning the kinks and dents in the bike, and that i knew everything about the bike model and showed them where i scratched my name in 5 years ago. but since i didn't press charges they couldn't do much. then my friends smile and proceed to tell them this "what if we can kill two birds with one stone? what if we can proof that the person who locked this bike is not the owner? and what if can catch the person at the same time in one swoop? all you have to do is put a lock on the bike and wait for the person to come and as he is coming to pick up the bike, which should be between 00:00 (so around the time we were talking) and 01:00 (when all the bars are closing). he will be stunned and suprised and then you guys will come around the corner and so will we and start questioning him about it. and since he can't proof it to you guys he must have either stolen the bike or bought it from a thief?(which is also punishable thought our law)" the two police officers were quite skepitcal with the plan, until my friends proceed to call his dad through skype, and give the phone to them. my friends dad shows proof of who he is and that he agrees with the plan and takes full resposibility for anythings that will happen after this call. both officer agree on his term, and then one of them tells them that i should press charges online rightn now throug my phone with the frame number of the bike so that i can use it as proof that it ws mine. as we set everything up the moment of truth happens. around 01:10 a scrawny looking guy comes around the corner, wearing a hoody,jeans, and some nike air max. as he is walking up to the bike he stops midway and then runs to the bike. he is checking it and then starts screaming and swearing in polish (had 5 polish friends who were my high school buddies, and we used to play a lot of online shooters on east europe servers, where they swear in russian and polish, so you pick some shit up) so the suka keeps screaming, and that was the que for the police officer to come around the corner and have a talk with this guy. the guy sees the cops and is frozen on the spot. i proceed to walk around the corner with my friend and we walk towards the guy until we're infront of him. the police officer ask him what the issue is and why he's screaming he proceed to tell the officer that someone locked his bike. the officer looks at him and smiles then points at me and tells him "that's funny cause this guy just told me his bike got stolen, and that this bike looks exactly the same as his. the guy got caught when he couldn't show the cops any proof that the bike was his. the agony in his face was beautiful. on the spot i remembered that i had i had some pictures with my bike that i made in the past and that you could also see the exact same dent with it in it. the cops were convinced now, they proceed to get the bolt cutter from their car and cut the lock like it was nothing. before i go away i walk up to the car and look at the guy and tell him "thanks for the fix bro, i don't have to pay for jack shit anymore. the police officers thanked us and to call them if we ever have another crazy adventure like this. i say goodbye to my friend and to tell his dad that i will send him a gift. as i get back on my bike i proceed to [smile]( like an idiot. while singing "i fought the law, and i won! and the people is how my birthday miracle happend. **edit:** i think some people are confused or just sceptical about this story. let me explain some little things so you might understand the situation better. i live in holland. in holland we use a lot more bikes than cars. so that means the rate of bike theft is also very high. so high even that there is a suprise check on the road just for bikes. to see if they're stolen or that your bike is still functioning fine, you actually get a fine for having no/broken lights or if your break doesn't work well. so that means we also have seperate laws just for bikes. so do understand some things are easier here when it comes to bikes, but some things are also harder because of the laws. so before anyone starts rambling about this story making no sense, try to imagine that you live in a country where the people actually care about bike owners.i didn't do what happened in these stories, i was too timid at the time to have the balls to do these, but my badass sister and my boyfriend did: a couple of years ago i dated an asshole (ah) who was physically and verbally abusive. after making me a shell of myself, stealing my debit card, putting me in debt and killing my credit he slept with our married coworker, and left me to be one of her several fuck buddies. a few months after we broke up he came crawling back to me to be friends (ie: using me for rides and money), being the idiot i was, i let him right back into my life. after a month of watching his abusive and controlling behavior my sister had enough. one night, while he was "showing he still could control me" (his exact words), made me stay outside my sister's house, in freezing weather, to cry to me about his latest failed conquest. she watched my attempts to try to go inside, just to get a jacket, only to see him yank me down to the stairs. she grabbed a large beer mug, and called together everyone in the house, and got them all to piss in it. she calmly went outside, mug in hand, and walked over to us, telling me it was a frosty beer. walking right up to ah, sitting on the wall, she motioned me to stand next to her, which i did, the next moment that "beer" was all over him. after marinating in it for a moment, the heat and smell being a dead giveaway, he realized what was on him. he screamed and ran off into the night, to this day if my sister sees him she'll sniff then ask what reeks of piss. the other story also involves ah, but this time my current boyfriend (bf) is the one dishing it out. bf and i share a love of wrestling, so we were planning on joining some friends at a hooters a few towns over to watch the latest pay-per-view. ah, seeing this as an opportunity to get money out of me, see scantily clad women and maybe flirt with someone, decided to tag along. right off the bat he was being a fuckball, refusing to chip in for gas (he agreed to get a different ride home and pay them), making us drive all over creation for him, making us wait outside his house for a half hour, then punching bf's window, telling us to behave (we were discussing the night's matches while i painted my nails). the ride up he mostly behaved, aside from a few crude comments, but the second we sat down he was hell-bent on making us as miserable as possible. my friends had 2 tables, one had 2 extra seats, the other only had one, so to me the seating arrangement was obvious, but not to asshole. as bf and i went to sit at the 2 spots, asshole began to complain and whine until someone gave him a seat closer to us. ah began ordering several expensive drinks and foods, while bf and i spilt an order of fries and each had a soda (relevant, i swear). while watching the ppv bf would occasionally hug me, or give me a quick peck, which apparently pissed ah off, so he tried to drag me next to him by my tounge. bf wasn't having it, so he pulled me back to my seat, keeping his arm around me. ah reacted by storming out of the restaurant. catching up to him he threatened to "beat my ass" if i came near him, so i went back inside and enjoyed the rest of the ppv. after it ended ah came back, insulted his ride home, then came up to bf and i, telling us we were going to pay his bill (over $50!!!), take him wherever we were planning to go, then bring him home, for free. i get ready to tell him off, when bf puts his hand on my shoulder and tells him we'll take care of everything, but he should go use the bathroom because it'll be a long drive. ah agrees and says at least one of us has a brain, scuttling away. i'm about to tell bf off, when he tosses my coat at me and drags me out to the car. 5 minutes later my phone starts blowing up, but its ignored. i later found out ah began begging everyone a free ride home, saying i'd promised him the night was on me (nope), so he didn't bring his wallet (another lie). he was forced to pay his bill, with tip, then pay my friend $50 for a ride home.this is a long story. i am leaving out 95% of the drama 'cuz it would take up too much space. it's about my second husband and how i went from deleriously happy to completely demoralized in less than two years, and how i paid him back. we met at work and i thought we had a fun and friendly work relationship. that's what i thought until the day i gave notice to quit. after that, he seemed upset, and when he called me from work, on mothers day, i found out why. he told me about his 20 year, loveless and hateful, marriage. and, he told me he loved me. my first thought was wtf?!? a married guy from work tells me he loves me? but after 7 years alone, it was nice to know i could still find someone to love me. as my last week at work wound down, we started to meet for lunch, dinner after work, hot makeout sessions in the car. i was determined to not have actual sex with him, because i had always had a rule against dating married men. but the passion was just too hot, the urges too strong, the whispers of love too enthralling to stop at just kissing. once the deed was done, there was no going back. the sex was just too good, too primal and so, so, so, very orgasmic, i just couldn't wait to have him for my own. after a couple of months we moved in together. it was like a fairytale. i was his princess. he took such good care of me, he doted on me, he did everything for me. we had sex every day, two, three, up to five times a day and i thought i was in heaven. there was drama with his ex, but he "loved" me and we could get past it. i was in love, i was blind to his faults, but that changed. eventually he started to get jealous over any interaction i had with men, co-workers, clients, men i walked past in the grocery store. it started to go horribly wrong. we eventually moved into his former marital home and it went beyond horrible. he started to slap me around, the emotional abuse and accusations increased to an every day occurrence. i had a feeling he was cheating, there were clues, but he told me i was crazy and imagining things. i quantified it in my demoralized mind, because he "loved" me. then i knew he was cheating. i went to his softball game, in disguise, and saw him with her. i finally knew i had to leave. i left him and did not tell him where. i got another job and did not tell him where. this was in the days before cell phones, so i didn't give him my new phone numbers. but we had some friends in common and he begged them to tell me he still"loved" me, that he was done with her, and that he wanted me back. i know, i was stupid, but he "loved" me, and i agreed to see him. the heat was still there, hot as hades, and i moved back in with him. i quit the crappy job i hated, and it was going to be fine. and it was, for the weekend. but he told me i had to go, he was wrong, and he wanted to be with her. so i eventually found a new place to live, found a new job, and i was going to move forward with my life. wrong! the same scenario was repeated, not once, not twice, but 5 or 6 times, always ending the same way, him persuing me until i went back to him, him telling me to leave, the last time i went back he asked me to marry him and fool that i was, i said yes, because he "loved" me. it was not a marriage made in heaven. he was still seeing her. he was still being emotionally abusive, he still slapped me around and accused me of cheating on him because i was 5 minutes late getting home from work and i was chewing gum to "cover up the smell of cum on my breath". yes, the cheating bastard actually said that, even though i had never even thought about cheating on him, but i guess that's what the pot does to convince himself that the kettle is black. the marriage lasted for 7 weeks. i left and moved in with family (he knew them, so he knew where i was). this time i was strong. he would call and leave messages for me and i wouldn't call back. he wanted to see me but i refused. he eventually filed for divorce. i did not contest it. the divorce was scheduled for final dissolution on a monday, and he called me on the friday before. he started to leave a message that went something like this. him: hi baby, i guess you know court is scheduled for monday. but i really miss you and i still "love" you and maybe we can work things out if you want to give it another try. there's still time to cancel the divorce, so if you think we can make it, give me a call back..... i pick up the phone then, but i don't stop the record function on the answering machine and i get our entire 30 minute phone conversation on tape. during this conversation i play along, letting him know i still love him, too. he tells me he is totally done with her, that he was only with her because he was so screwed up about us and he didn't want to be alone if he couldn't be with me. blahdiddy, blah, blah, blah. same old crap he had been feeding me for the last year, but the things he was saying about her were things she needed to hear. and by this time i was so over the bastard, i wanted the divorce to be absolutely and undeniably final. so i keep him talking, knowing full well that her is going to be arriving home from work soon. when he starts trying to end the call, i do everything i can to keep him talking, asking if her is going to be home soon, and he says "f*** her. i don't give a s*** about her. but i gotta go now and i will call you sunday." click. so, i take that tape and make 5 copies. over the past 9 months i had been doing some detective work. using his phone bills i was able to get the addresses of her brother, ex-husband, and parents. i sent copies of the tape to all of them with a note telling them to make sure her listens to it. i also sent a copy to her at his address. i sent them on saturday, overnight express, but i did not know that the post office delivers overnight packages on sunday. so my plan to get the tapes delivered on monday, after court, failed. i also delivered a copy of the tape to his attorney's office, who threatened me for illegally taping a phone conversation, to which i responded that he had to know it might be recorded because he started to leave a message and i "forgot" to stop the tape. that shut the attorney right up. so on sunday, the day before the divorce was supposed to be final, i get the final message. he is pissed, screaming the foulest descriptions of females that anyone has ever heard. he sounds like he's foaming at the mouth, he threatens revenge, he screams that the divorce will be final, and he is done with me. he went on for at least 10 minutes and i am sure her was there listening to his final rant against me. i wish i could have been there when her listened to the tape, and knowing that he might have intercepted the tape i sent to his house, is why i sent tapes to her relatives. i wanted to make sure she heard what he said about her. only she was just as stupid as i was and ended up married to him. but it still wasn't over. he started leaving "love" notes on my car. he sent me roses on my birthday. i sent the notes and roses back to her and told her to get her man some professional help 'cuz he was just plain crazy. so i wished for a man who would love me and have sex as often as i wanted. i got a man who"loved" me and had sex more often than any woman needed. but i should have known that a cheater will always be a cheater. and it was my big, big bad for breaking my rule about never dating married men. never happened again. i did hear later that they were still married, and that he was still cheating on her. better her than me. edit for clarity: although he was still legally married, they were living apart, ex was living with her boyfriend, and there were custody and property issues that delayed the final divorce decree. so even though tbey were still legally married i was not the cause of the breakup. but it is not a wise choice to be with someone until the final papers are signed.a few years ago i was going to a&amp;p school for 6 hours a night after working a 10 hour day all week. i hated being there along with everyone else that was there. we had this huge fucking doucher named bobby as a classmate. he'd done time for theft, drove a bmw that mom and dad had bought for him, disappeared so often that our instuctor made it a weekly assignment for someone to keep tabs on him and make sure he wasn't stealing something or fucking shit up. everytime he got in trouble for some stupid shit he did, he'd try to blame the instructors like they had it out for him personally. everyone, and i mean everyone, hated the idiot. he made all our lives even more depressing than it already was. on our smoke breaks he'd smoke half a cigarette, knock the cherry off and set it in a little groove on a sort of retaining wall, then go back inside. he would always come back out at the next break and finish it. for 16 months, 5 nights a week, i would pick up his leftover cigarette butt, stick it in my pants, rub the filter on my asshole as if chalking a pool stick, place it back on into the groove, and then watch him smoke it at the next break. it happend so much that eventually, everyone in my class, including the instructor knew i was doing it, and no one ever said a fucking word. the more detailed backstory is [here]( i tried to get some ideas here /r/evilbrainstorming, but that sub sucks by the way, unlike /r/prorevenge !!! *** in my work we have a few people who are true characters. unfortunately one of them is not so fun. a co-worker, an obese version of [don jon]( (literally), whom we call jon don because of his name, wasn't cleaning the toilet after himself for months. i and couple other guys tried to talk to him, but nothing worked. moreover, his trips to the ditch were making unable to use the toilet for any other men for the next 30-40 minutes, due to poor ventilation and poisoning gasses which were just hanging in the air. i found somewhere on prorevenge about capsaicin. i tested it out and decided to use it. *** i told all the guys, to be careful with the toilet, and actually i got the support of my actions, since no legal way was possible, and talking to jon don didn't do a thing. first, i sprayed the toilet sitting with the capsaicin solution. didn't to a thing, but i didn't think about the paper everyone uses to put on the sitting first. my second try required little more research and more time to make it work. since i'm a patient person, all the time i was delighted with the thoughts of upcoming prorevenge. *** i'm always on time at work, unlike jon don, which gave me the advantage in form of my research and not being spotted on my plans. one day, i went to the restroom, and marked the toilet paper every 10 blisters and rolled it back. all the guys knew to don't use the toilet which jon don was always using. after jon don's finished throwing with mud on the porcelain, and a significant amount of time has passed, i went to measure how much paper does don jon use. for the safety reasons, i repeated this procedure on another day. *** the 3rd step was simple, since i had all my data necessary. i measured the amount of the paper he uses, and i sprayed the capsaicin solution while i was rolling the toilet paper back, letting it to dry a little. very important here is the message i left. i wrote on a sticky note polite information, which i placed little after jon don would already wiped his butt with "capsaicinated" paper, so he didn't see the message before he rubbed the capsaicin on. the message said: "jon don, i ask you to start cleaning after yourself and to not make the toilet to smell like a shithell. this is the last warning. the next step will be letting to know all the female employees about the situation, which as you know was the secret among males. your co-worker." or something like that. i made sure with an american co-worker that there are no grammar mistakes, so the note wouldn't point directly to me, since i'm the only male in the company who's english is a second language. and since jon don knew my writing, i made sure it's unrecognizable. to be 100% sure everything will work like planned, i made fresh coffee after the lunch, which i knew jon don will consume, to soon after hit the "gym." *** every male employee knew what's about to happen. we all were waiting in anticipation for jon don, very curious of the outcome, hoping to teach jon don a lesson, which his mom definitely forgot to do. he walked our sweating and walking funny and very fast. he couldn't sit longer than 30 seconds at his desk and suddenly walked out from the office. he didn't show up back that day. he also didn't call the boss that he's leaving, but we made sure that he won't get in trouble covering for him. *** the toilet has been squeaky clean from the moment the message was delivered. i can also tell jon don spends much less time sitting on the toilet. we still wait after he's done, just to be safe. *** all the guys promised to forget about the revenge and to never talk again about it. i'm sure jon don will remember the lesson. *** so what really happened with the solution and jon don's ass? the solution itself has no color and no scent. but it burns the hell out of every part of skin you put it on. i accidentally touched my face after testing, even i washed my hands very carefully with a lot of dish washing soap, and it still burned my face. i can't imagine the agony and the burning sensation after rubbing it on your anus. until this day, i have no idea what happened to jon don after he received the message. the next day everything was back to normal, besides the toilet has been clean. *** tl;dr - a co-worker didn't want to start cleaning after himself, and one day his ass gets on fire.when i was in the 12th grade i went to a house party with a few of my friends. this was back when the hot game console was the ps2. (relevant later) when we walked in the kid that lived in the house and a couple of his friends were sitting there manhandling this really wasted girl. like putting their hands down her pants and sniffing each other's fingers and shit. we broke up the fondle party and took her home. she begged us not to report the incident. i'm not totally sure about her reasons. with it being a tiny town and the perpetrator being a football star and the popular guy in school, she claimed that there would be some sort of backlash. that sucks, but we respected her wishes. fast forward to several weeks later to the scene of a huge house party at the same place. he had a brand new ps2 and we each took turns slipping into the party when everyone was passing out and we pissed all inside the disc tray and down into the inside of the console to where you could shake it and would slosh. another friend of mine that had no piss on deck pinched a giant loaf into one of his dresser drawers. another one of us went in mr. rapist's mom and dad's bedroom, lifted up the blankets, stuck his finger down his throat and vomited a "crave case" of white castle sliders onto their bed and then neatly made the bed back. i'm sure when they returned from their church convention four days later it smelled pretty nice in that room. his methodist pastor father grounded him for all eternity. he was never prosecuted for the crime but last i saw him, mr. curious hands (now in his mid 30's) had six or seven small children and was in line at the local pawn shop trying to pawn a stolen tv for some meth. (it's a small midwestern town. if you take a shit everyone knows.) edit: i know this story is real. for me to try too hard to convince every skeptic would be pointless.background: me (19 f) and my sister (23) have never gotten along. she has always had it out for me for as long as i can remember... i have two younger siblings (17 f and 15 m) who she tolerates and for the most part gets along with. for example, she used to yell at me for going in the car with my mom to pick her up from places when she was in middle school/high school, on vacations with my cousins we all slept in the same bed and she would pinch me to the point of tears and whisper cruel things to me (she was around 15-17), when i was about 12 she threw scissors at me for being on the computer and not getting off when she wanted....i could go on forever but these are a few of the more minor things she's done. she has no remorse and cares only about herself and things that will benefit her, regardless of who she hurts. she is extremely territorial as well. after doing a bit of growing up i thought we were past this and able to tolerate each other, but tonight proved otherwise. i got a text from my younger sister telling me that my older sister was yelling and screaming that i had taken things from her room while she was away for the night.. i raced home (knowing what she is capable of in this type of mood) to find her screaming "you know what you did f*** you" etc... she couldnt tell me exactly what i took from her but she knew *something* was missing... i yelled back a bit and shrugged it off until i walked into my room to find [this]( the clothes are minor, but the puppy holds **a lot** of sentimental value..i picked up one of the legs off of my floor and fell to the floor in tears..i've had him for 11 years and fallen asleep with him in my arms every night. she knew how much this would hurt me. in third grade i went to work with my father for the day. after work he took me over to his friends restaurant in the seaport and we hung out there for a bit. i remember him giving me a little bit of money and his friends girlfriend (now wife) took me into the south street seaport mall where i picked out the cutest, softest stuffed animal i could find. we went back into the restaurant and started brainstorming names.. we finally decided on jereca.... a combination of my name, her name and the waitresses name (who i always thought was the coolest girl) from then on, jereca pretty much became my best friend in a way... he always provided me with comfort.. so when i walked in to see her do **that** over something that she was imagining killed me... i don't know what to do with myself..i'm hurt, angry and sad about this whole situation... any questions, comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.. p.s.the skirt is by the brand splendid... i bought it last year for a great price at loehmanns but i can't seem to find it online anywhere...anyone know a place that would have it? **update** so my parents said they had this long talk with her, she will replace what she damaged and that i need to let it go... this type of behavior from her is not uncommon and has been occurring since i was young. i threatened a police report and got yelled at. i asked for money to install deadbolts on my closet doors and i was told to knock it off. i really don't understand what goes through my parents heads, but my sister is not mentally stable.be warned. this is a very long story, i have shortened it and left out some details so any clarifications please ask. what occurred happened over the course of a year. &amp;nbsp; my mum is a very sweet lady. divorced. 70 years old, still works full time. trusting of everybody. she still lives in my family home and rents out a room to help with the bills and the company (it’s a fairly large house). we have had a string of lodgers live in the house over the years but this one was nothing like we ever expected. enter james, a well-presented, well-spoken man who worked in executive recruitment. 52 years old, thinning on top, a golden handshake and an air of superiority. he came telling tales of divorce and looking for somewhere to live that felt like a family home and not a hotel room. strange but he sold the story to my mums. he has id, he has business cards backing up his claim of employment. he seems like an ideal lodger. &amp;nbsp; things go normally for half a year. he seems like a nice guy. he is constantly telling us that he works for a recruitment company and is waiting on delivery of a jaguar company car. this was the first red flag. he regales us with stories of his past and tells my mum he was in the army in his younger years. specifically the parachute regiment. after a while he begins to make romantic moves with my mum and spending more and more time together. he takes a copy of my cv and offers to help me find better employment, either at his company or at one of his clients. even going so far as to arrange meeting with me to help me with my interview techniques. he pays his rent on time, often with a little extra for my mum. keeps saying he will be moving back out into his own property soon. &amp;nbsp; this is where things start to fall apart. it is now 8 months and the jaguar has never arrived. he has an excuse for everything. job interviews i am lined up for mysteriously start being cancelled, he is now romantically involved with my mother. i get a little suspicious but my suspicions are cooled when i am involved in a 3 way phone conversation with himself and a client as a primary job interview (for an incredibly prestigious job which i am afterwards told went very well and i would have a sit down shortly, he even starts offering to buy my mother and myself new cars. he arrives with brochures and books test drives for various cars. it was fun, but it just didn’t sit well with me. i should not have done it, but i had a quick search of his room and found id’s with two different names and paperwork in a black back pack that suggested he had been arrested before. i immediately tried to explain the situation to my mum, who dismissed it without reason (rose tinted glasses) and an almighty argument starts. i leave the house, covering all my tracks. i never found out who the client was on the phone. &amp;nbsp; a week later i get a phone call from a recruitment firm, asking me who i am and why i was in their system. it turns out that tony was a recruiter who had set-up a side business with an existing recruitment agency to provide high end recruitment. the owner / business partner was impressed with his credentials, but so far he had failed to deliver on just about everything and started missing days in the office. because of this they had gone through his e-mail and found one from me when i sent him my cv. at first they suspected me of being a client he was dealing with off the books, but it later turned out everything he had promised the company had been a lie. he was claiming commission for placing staff at companies that either never show up or didn't exist at all. a 2 hour phone call with the ceo of this company was enough to prove all my suspicions. this guy was either a pathological liar or a conman &amp;nbsp; it took a very long conversation with my mum, followed by an argument and then another conversation to get her to see sense. it was only then that she shared more details i had previously not known. he had been enquiring about her will more and more and the value of the house. promised her holidays that never surfaced and his behaviour was becoming stranger and stranger. it was at first a bit embarrassing, so many red-flags we had both either not seen or ignored, but with the rose tinted glasses firmly taken off it was all so clear. my mum had just returned from having a meal with tony before i had a sit down with her. our plan was to search his room, find evidence and either go to the police or wait for him to return. the first thing i did was try and locate his backpack along with the id’s but it was gone. everything else was still in the room but that bag. i had a sinking feeling that he had already guessed the game was up, i was being far too aggressive with my quest for information and had some how tipped him off. we waited for him to return. &amp;nbsp; he never returned. he had realised the game was up. i’m not sure how, but just like that he was gone. my mum was heart broken, i was stressed. we realised a lot of the things he had promised had been lies. it hurt. i had taken days off work for job interviews that never transpired. my mum had started to work less and less under promises that she would be financially supported by him. i needed my revenge. i needed to make him pay for hurting my family, hurting me, hurting my mum. we can only speculate what his end plan was. we suspect he was after the house, but she’s incredibly healthy by normal standards, let alone a 70 year old woman. god knows what he had planned to do. &amp;nbsp; i didn't sleep that night. the first thing i did was change the locks and get a close friend to watch the house. i then told the people next door what had happened and asked them to keep an eye out. i then logged a complaint with the police via a friend in the force and set to work. &amp;nbsp; the first piece of revenge, take every possession he had and donate it to the local homeless shelter. the sharp suits, shoes unworn and still in boxes, his tie collection. class rings, jewellery. all given to the homeless. it took 2 trips in my truck to move them but we did it. i hope we had some very well dressed homeless people that year. i hope the suits helped them with job interviews. i then called his (now ex) business partner / boss and confirmed what had happened. the two of us set to work contacting every recruitment company in the area with a copy of his photo, name(s) and a brief explanation that he was not to be trusted. we also went through a list of his previous employers / customers. many of them confirmed similar strange goings on and agreed to spread the word. i then contacted a friend who actually was in the parachute regiment. they can find no record of his existence, he claimed he saw combat in one particular war which would have made him eligible for a certain medal or commendation. no record is found of this. the army take a dim view of people falsifying service. &amp;nbsp; so we had taken his job and all the possessions he had except the clothes on his back and his car. (god i wanted that car. i wanted to crush it!). next was to remove his support network. we tried to trace his family, eventually finding the name and number of his ex-wife. we called her, she was a lovely woman who confirmed what we thought. it was not the first time suspicious goings on had happened but it was certainly the worst it had been. she had left him over his escalating behaviour. she suspects the behaviour to be from a break down of some kind. tells us he used to be very successful but lost his job and it set him on a downward spiral. she talks to their 3 children who immediately wash their hands of him. she confirms his lack of military service and fills in a lot of blanks for us. i had taken from him his home, his job, his carrier, his clothes and now his family. the police now had a report and where looking for him too and my friend in the parachute regiment told me not to worry about whatever they were doing about it, just to know they knew about it. &amp;nbsp; i spent a week touring the homeless shelters, hospitals and hotels looking for him. i drove over 800 miles at night looking for his car. we will never know where he went but i never found him or his car. his family have since had contact and his youngest son knows where he is. they assure me he checked into a facility and is receiving help. i’m not convinced but i’m not going to shake a teenage boy down for the location of him. his name and face is seared into my mind and i want nothing more than to take from him his heath but even i have a limit. but one day i will come across him again. i don’t know what i will do then. &amp;nbsp; post script: this occurred over the course of a year. there are a lot of details i had to miss out to keep this short enough to post. on the face of it all involved look very naive for falling for it but that is how con-men perform their art. they become part of your life, work your way in. there is a supporting cast behind this that helped me with my revenge and i will never forget their help. i wish i could finish the story with an epic final show down, a beating and a trip to the hospital / jail but sadly real life doesn't always go that way. i took as much as i could from him and i hope i stopped him doing it again, i believe he may well have done something to my mum once he got into the will. thank you for reading my story. &amp;nbsp; edit - someone pointed out i called him james and then tony. james was the name he gave us. his real name turned out to be tony. we called him james for entire time we knew him. since then i have got into the habit of referring to him as tony. spain returns dog poop left behind by irresponsible dog owners. go to: when i was growing up my big brother was always a pain in the ass to me. he had some anger issues and whatnot and since he was 9 years older than me he thought he was allowed to run the show. he would lock me out of the house when he was supposed to be babysitting me, he would do "fun" things like pinning me down and tapping me in one spot on the head which he called "chinese water torture," he told me i was 1/2 alien when i was 5 because we're only 1/2 siblings and i couldn't figure out what the other half was, and he was just a shitty person all around. (bonus revenge: one time when he was playing the lock-sdh59-out-of-the-house game i snagged the phone and called 911, cried into the receiver, and hung up. then i put the phone down and ran like hell. turns out they called back and my brother couldn't answer (because the phone was locked outside with me) so they sent police cars out. my brother had fun explaining that one to my parents.) well, one day i had enough. he had all these gaming consoles and stuff that were considered hot shit at the time (~2000). he never let me play with them and i thought that was rude, so i planned my revenge. one summer he went away *all* summer long and left his car in our barn. he also left all his little plastic game save things (i don't know what they're called. they're little cards that you would save your game to and each card was a different game.) in his room. well, i went into his room and took all the cards i could see and buried them around the property. but did i stop there? noooo. he had a glorious car in the garage that was just *begging* to be messed with. so what did i do? i took a jar of pickles and i dumped the whole thing in the back of his car. now, keep in mind that it gets hotter than a billy goat's ass in a pepper patch during the summer. by the time he got back his car smelled **terrible,** but that's not even the best part. he was moving across country after that summer to go live in arizona and he had no choice but to take the car that smelled like death and sweet, sweet revenge. **tl;dr** be nice to your little siblings. edit: a lot of you are getting butthurt over this. i told him about it a few years ago and he punched me on the arm and laughed. he said the car smelled horrible and he hated that trip and he never even knew the memory cards (thanks /u/jay2themellow) were missing. chillax, peeps. hello reddit! i have been reading through quite a few of these /prorevenge stories today and i must say i am inspired to share. i am going to flip a few names for anonymity and to avoid further humiliation of my former roommate. a few years back shortly after high school i acquired my first apartment living with two room mates. both of them i had considered close enough friends to occupy a space with. little did i know that living with people is incredibly complex due to the absolute lack of fucks given during your early 20's. shortly i will get to one of the highlights of this hellish rollercoaster into eviction. room mate brett had some sort of sick fascination with eating all of my food. didn't matter what it was or who it belonged to...he would demolish it. namely...my reese's puffs. i had tried multiple methods of reasoning with him. marking my name on the items, hiding them, even heated confrontation. he persisted and it was time to extract vengeance. a little background on my situation in order to provide clarity to the story. i had been convicted of a crime and ended up having to endure a shit load of community service hours working on an animal ranch owned by a non profit organization that rescued abandoned animals. there was a plethora of random ass animals ranging from peacocks to potbelly pigs that took residence within this sanctuary. all of them less than desirable to work with and clean up after. but none of them could exceed the absolute nightmare cleverly disguised as a pack of llama's. these were mean little bastards who would find any way to torment you. be it spitting, shitting, chasing, staring, or shouting. they had it out for me from the get go. fun fact that most would not know is that llamas like to all congregate and shit in one giant pile...this is like some form of sacred place for them and they do not like it being disturbed. none the less i was responsible for hauling shovel after shovel of the precious little nuggets into large containers and hauling them off the property. here is where it gets interesting...i had this sort of epiphany as i dug the shovel into the almighty giant pile of llama love. it had an interesting pellet shape and was relatively light and airy. it also had different shades of browns ranging from a creamy peanut butter color to an earthy dark chocolate tone. it looked....a lot like reese's puffs. there was no time to waste and no hesitation. the son of a bitch had just devoured the rest of my cereal and it was time to give him a lesson in apartment living. i bought a brand new box on the way home and replaced the contents of the bag with llama shit that i had collected earlier that day in a ziploc freezer bag. even thought i would purchase a chip clip and neatly roll it closed as if i had already enjoyed my morning bowl before placing it back on the top of the fridge. the trap was set... he rolled out of bed at the usual time around 10pm and enjoyed a quick wake and bake before he gorged himself on whatever delicious treats he could get his hands on. the sound of his barefeet on the kitchen floor. i awaited anxiously in my bedroom awaiting the sound of the plastic cereal bag unraveling. he was going for it! i heard the fridge open for some milk and the drawer open for a spoon! i heard him step over to the couch and sit down... complete silence before the almighty crunch crunch of victory echoed through the apartment. and then... he turned the tv on? and there was another crunch crunch.... then chuckling.... wtf? how can you not realize you are eating llama shit!? i told him on the 30th day of our eviction..... tldr: fooled my shithead roommate into eating llama shit. in the span of 2-3 months in 2003 i got put into a few situations where i had to get physical with people. since that little window of time, i haven’t really been in any similar situations. here is one of them. i read the rules, and i'm not 100% sure if i should have posted this here, or justiceporn or some place else. if so, please redirect me. i was at a bar with 2 of my friends called (bar) in (city). (the bar is closed now, so i assume it’s not a big deal that i reference it) it was big ass beer night ($2 for 22 oz bottles). pretty sweet deal, right? as you can imagine, people get pretty wasted these nights. unlike my usual drunken nights, i’m not in too bad a shape when we leave the bar at closing time. the bar is in a strip mall and the parking lot is located directly across from the entrance to the bar. (yes, this isn’t the classiest place, but was a lot of fun) as usual, when we leave there is a bunch of people meandering around, typically trying to salvage one last chance of hooking up. i get to the parking lot, about 25’ from the entrance, and see 2 guys jostling around another guy against a car. i assume it’s their buddy and they are just dicking around, wrestling. then i notice they are reaching into his pockets and i hear one of them say something along the lines of “get his wallet.” this kid they have pinned against the car is completely out of it. he is barely able to stand up on his own, let alone fend off two thugs. these kids were pure trash. scrawny, tatted up, shaved head punks. granted none of those characteristics mean you are trash, but i wanted to give a brief description of these guys. both of them are probably between 5’7”-5’8”, maybe 150-160 lbs each. at this point i decide i can’t let this go on and decide to intervene. i walk over the two guys with my hands held out, basically the way you would have them as if you were giving a speech. there was no sign of aggression out of me, as i was just going to tell them that needed to stop what they were doing. once i’m in front of them, they back away from the guy and turn my way. i’ve got one to my left and one to my right, but both in front of me. before i could get a word out, the guy on the right punches me above my right eye. it didn’t hurt, but it really woke me up and got my adrenaline pumping. i’m not a small guy. i’m 6’4 and at this time around 205-210 lbs. i work out, so i’m in pretty decent shape. when this happens, i’m still not in a defensive position, had it hurt maybe i would have been, but i begin to say “ok. well now you fucked up.” i get out “ok. now you f…” and the guy on the left punches me in the head right above my left eye. now standing there, both stunned looks on their faces. guess they couldn’t figure out why neither of their hits fazed me. after a 2-3 second pause between the three of us staring at each other, the guy to my left (who just hit me) turns and runs. i give a quick glance to the guy to my right and then hightail it after the guy who took off. i’m pretty fast, but i’ve got flip flops on. i’m tearing ass down this strip mall after him and my flip flops….well flop off. i keep pursuing him. he runs towards this guy walking with his girlfriend. this is where i get a little confused; maybe the guy had seen everything that had just gone down, but the guy running from me gets within inches of the guy and his girlfriend and the guy blasts the thug kid in his face. so he runs full force into this guys fist. his head and spine fling back. it doesn’t knock him down and he turns around the corner to disappear into the night. i gave up. i wasn’t ever going to catch him. i turn around, assuming the other guy would be gone too. to my surprise my other buddy is wildly swinging a miniature metal bat at this guy. once i get back to where they are, my buddy has stopped swinging the bat and the police have arrived. my friend conceals the bat and is able to put it back into his car prior to the police seeing it. everyone is explaining what happened and pointing out the other thug kid as the instigator of everything that has gone down. well he gets arrested and put into the back of the police car. i walk by, stop next to the police car, really big smirk on my face and it makes him go wild. calling me a bitch, saying he’s going to kill me, blah blah blah. i give him a wink and say “that’s cool buddy.” as i turn around towards the crowd, i have about 5-6 of this guy’s friends coming up and shaking my hand. thanking me for what i’ve done, while i’m thinking “where the fuck were you guys??” the police ask if i can come to the station and make a statement, i say “absolutely.” yeah, bullshit. my two buddies and i get in our car and head home. i hope the thug kid gets what he deserves, but i’m not going to a police station at 3 in the morning after a night of drinking. **tl/dr don't be a piece of shit to people.**this is a long one. i'll make a line below to let you know when the revenge starts, the rest is just back story and justification. i worked as a contractor under a security company for this one business. i was underneath my supervisor "super" from here on out. i was young when i first started working there. it was my first time actually working in a corporate environment for any real length of time. i had no idea how the politics worked, the pecking order and how much like highschool it reminded me. super had "trained" me for that site. i had really just worked with the company to find out what roles needed to be filled and done by security, and i wrote the book for dayshift for that site. i had trained every guard that came through that site. super got the credit of course. super also made mistakes and didn't care about the job. since i don't want to be here all day i'll just list if. if you'd like an explanation just ask down below. screwing up mail and blaming it on me, sleeping on the job and blaming the missed work on "re-training" me, telling the employees of my mistakes and personal life, taking the credit of any work that i did that he could, "not hearing" an exchange between an employee and myself which would have saved me from a write up (this one was the last straw by the way, since it was so clearly bs). and frankly a ton of other mean, condescending, and controlling things in and out of work that he said "was part of the job" which included driving around employees and himself, before and after work. without compensating gas or time. thing was, my complaints went no where, since the client was best friends with super and one of the requirements for our company having the gig was keeping super on. so it was either suck up, or leave. well i needed the job, and the other guards needed a buffer between them and super. related to revenge: i had sold him a broken car (he knew it was broken) for some small sum of money. he had to scrap it, i used that money for this next part. __________________________________________________________ see, super had a problem. he was diabetic. worse than that, he didn't seem to think it was that big of a deal. checked his level maybe once a week. using the money from the car purchase i did the only thing that came to mind. something my father once told me: "when someone makes to mad, kill them with kindness". so that's what i did. using that money i had bought so much candy and sweets, just for him. cookies, jolly ranchers, caramel, soda, recies pieces, fun size, king size, assorted bags, german chocolate. everything. i'd give him as much candy as he would take. and he'd take a lot. see, he doesn't buy candy or unhealthy things normally. but if put on a plate, he'd eat it just the same. i knew this would take a long time, but i had the time and patience to spare. i could wait. it took 2 years before the medical problems started happening. he started going to the doctor more often. would never say what was happening though. he would start to deny my sweet poison, until he saw me enjoying myself. then he couldn't resist. perhaps he was a stress eater, who knows. i had eventually moved to a different position (non-security related), but i still kept in touch with security there. as well as leave my rather large collection of candy for supers consumption. turns out he had to quit working security. turns out he had 40% functionality left of his kidneys. last i heard, he was having extreme numbness/swelling in his feet as well. extreme? perhaps, but perhaps he shouldn't have stuffed his face and taken his disease a bit more serious. the rest of the security team was happy to not have super around, they were now free to do their jobs. that is until the next super (super2) came around. which is another prorevenge tale in and of itself. if people want, i can tell that one as well. [part 2](my mom was the second oldest growing up and had 3 brothers. her parents always thought of her as the good kid but only because she wasn't as wild as her brothers (especially the younger ones) and was sneakier about it. the following story is one of her favorites and is honestly more brutal than any experience i ever had growing up. the youngest of my mom's brothers was j and he was a real terror when he was a kid. one day at the house when they were both very young, my mom notices j sharpening a pencil. normally that wouldn't be too big of a deal but he kept going and going on the crank (one of those old grindy manual sharpeners) all the while giving her an evil smile. my mom realized what's coming so she took off running and j started chasing her around the house making stabbing motions with the pencil like an idiot. this went on for a little while before my mom suddenly thought about it and wondered why she was running. after all, he may have had a sharp pencil but she was older and she should be able to use her seniority to put j to back in his place instead of running away like he wanted. she stopped, turned around with her hand held straight out and shouted at j to "stop!". this probably would have worked except j was too close to stop and he ended up stabbing the pencil through my mom's hand when he ran into her. i don't know where the adults were before all this but they showed up and took my mom to the hospital. everything was sorted out with no lasting damage. i'm sure j was punished for what he did in some way but my mom can carry a grudge and she was not satisfied yet. my mom got better and soon after she was able to get her revenge. j and my mom were playing a game of tether ball outside and j just so happened to have a bottle of coke that he was drinking from. this is back in the days when coke was only sold in those tall glass bottles. at some point during the game it was my mom's turn to serve the ball when j picked up his bottle to take a drink. she saw her chance and took it without thinking. she served the ball and watched as it soared around the pole and directly into the back of the bottle j was drinking from. my mom was able to play it off as an accident at the time and j had to get new teeth put in but once again there wasn't any long term damage. tldr: my uncle semi-intentionally stabbed my mom in the hand with a pencil so she used a tether ball to knock out his top 2 front teeth.i love riding bicycles. i'm good at it and i'm safe. in this story, i was riding on a busy but necessary street at night. helmet, reflectors and flashing lights were in use. a bunch of bros in a big suv came up close beside me and started swerving towards and away from me while yelling and taunting - trying to crash me into parked cars. i ignored them as best i could and they gave up soon, but as they pulled away i hocked a great gob of spit towards their vehicle. i was hoping to hit the windshield but to my happy surprise it entered the passenger window and i heard an angry exclamation of surprise. i like to imagine that it hit that fucker square in the face. tl;dr: suv goons tried to run me off the road; i spit in one of their faces from behind.so i have this cousin who can definitely be an ass. first of all, he thinks he is a hot shot. he works at apple, but is one of those home advisors. truth is he probably only makes about $15-17 per hour. i personally make about $85000 a year. regardless of the circumstance, he tries to make it sound like he is better than me. for example, he tells my friends that i'm not very bright. not going to go through the reasons, but i am definitely brighter. he also brags that once he gets married or moves in with his girlfriend, he will be making ton of money and get a better house than me. there are other examples, but you can take the hint. this guy is an ass. now his girlfriend is the exact opposite. she is completely cool and she is finishing school for a pharmacist. he treats her like shit. rarely pays for dates, doesn't open the car door for her, etc. he really doesn't know how to treat a woman. you may be wondering why she puts up with this crap? the truth is she has a low self esteem of herself. no idea why cause she has it all. i'm not a person who usually commits any kind of revenge as i figure a person will get what eventually is coming to them. but once i got some breaking info, i decided to use it to my advantage. when the ashley madison leaks happened, i did a search to see who is on the list. searched a lot and got nothing. but all of a sudden i got my cousins email to come up. at first i was thinking, why would he be on this. i was thinking it was some kind of weird curiosity. i then downloaded the database on one of my vm. sure enough, i did a awk and sed for the addresses and his popped up. he made credit card transactions that totaled about $850. they took place when his girlfriend was away at college. now i know this guy cheated on her. this was enough for me. clearly he was using her as a sugar momma. i was thinking just approach her and give her the papers. but she might just dismiss it since she thinks i made this up to sabatoge him. plus i didn't. want to be known for breaking up the relationship. so i sent an anonymous big envelope with her school info as the return address. that way she would more than likely open it. i gave her all the info to prove he was cheating on her with married women. well it took a couple of weeks, but she finally broke up with him. i found out she spoke to my brother in laws wife as they are close. she helped seal the deal. both my brother in law and wife didn't think my cousin was right for his girlfriend. and they wanted them to break up. but there is more to the story. it was a big deal he lost his meal ticket to riches. but something else came out of this. so apparently he was going to the genius bar where he used to work and was stealing tons of small stuff. like usb cables, power adapters, cases, and etc. his ex knew it. but again with the low self esteem, she never said anything. well she turned him in to the local apple store and apple eventually fired him afte investigating. this caused a spiral of events. he lost his truck and now stuck living with his mom. he's 25 years old and still stuck with mommy. needless to say his bragging is much less tldr: arrogant cousin pisses me off. find he cheats on his girlfriend through ashleu madison, told his girlfriend, lost his girlfriend and his job.this was a few years ago when i was in final year of highschool. i found out one of the students in the year below thought he was smart by "hacking" all the girls emails, by setting up email forwarding when they left their computers alone. he had been listening in on "gossip" that was being shared around, that he had no business of looking at. so the next time in web dev class, i set up a quick script that would spam his email address with 100's of messages. as it turns out, since it was running over the local network, i was sending email faster then it could be processed by his inbox, and it ended up at 101% allowance, he couldn't move email to trash, because he was over allowance, the system couldn't cope! he goes to the it office to get his email account looked at, and the school it guy couldn't even fix it, he had to issue him a new login, when asked why his email was full of messages from an unknown source, he couldn't answer, so i suspect that the it guy figured he had spammed his own account.[first one]( this story isn't as extreme as the last story, at least as far as the revenge goes. however, super2 deserved worse. as i said before i had moved to another job after security. this job was in that building. super1 had told new boss (boss from here on out) not to hire me. that i was lazy, rude, distracted, ect. however, boss had known me for years at this point and known this was not true. i made sure boss did not regret hiring me and took any assignment or overtime he needed covered. all jobs were done when they needed to be done. i was the go to guy in my new job. super1 had gotten sick and left his position. instead of promoting anyone they had hired super2 into the position. literally everyone else in the building knew how to do super2s' job better than he did. come to find out super2 is really just super1 2.0: likes to take naps, pass the blame, ect. ssdd. only super2 had an additional hobby. he like to (allegedly) sexually harass the female guards. multiple, to my knowledge at least 3 by as many guards, complaints were filed with both the company and the sec company's hr. every one of those guards were transferred to another site. at this point the guards that i've trained and worked with still see me as part of the team, i was the lead after all. but there was nothing i could have done, i was no longer working with them. only thing i could do was to let them know to warn the female guards ahead of time, and to keep an eye out. some time after all this, i broke a rule. (my mistake i admit that). i wont get into it because it's far too long for my patience to type out. what is relevant are the below details. * i broke rule * super2 was sleeping during this time * super2 didn't like that i broke rule and made a big deal out of it * i made it a bigger deal. since mutually assured destruction was an acceptable outcome in my book. turns out it reached the c-level. also turns out the c-level cared more about the details of the people responsible for protecting the building than me breaking that rule. i got called into a phone meeting, where super2 boss, my boss, and super2 were on the other end. i was told to drop it by them. my boss knew i was telling the truth, but didn't want to lose me (respect him for looking out). but this is when super2 made it my business. he called me a liar, that everything i dug up, all the evidence, all the forged reports. were all lies. everyone in that room knew the truth, but he called me a liar. i'm a dick, yea. but i'm not a liar by any stretch, and that set me off. see everyone knew me from my days as security, and i knew everyone. from c-level and down to the janitor. i had asked a c that i was friendly with what the deal was. he said there wasn't enough evidence. after showing him what i collected, he says this never made it up to him. i was confused and did some digging. turns out that my boss was a little too trusting of super2's boss. super2's boss liked to keep things to himself, because if super2 looked bad, his boss would look bad. the c-level guy said not to worry, he'd take care of it. a week later super2 was out the door. my evidence, plus some i didn't collect helped put him there. also the security company was told that if they didn't take proper action against super2, then there wouldn't be a contact for them anymore. they ended up losing the contract anyways because they never let the company know about the harassment issues, and that could endanger the employees. currently the super for security is a guy i personally trained and trust. overall a really good guy, if a bit strict, but that's ok. things are better for my old team, and things are better for me since then. i'm not a good story teller so if some things dont makes sense, please let me know. edit: let lose the typos of war.my own story of revenge: after a mutual "friend" of a number of my friends ended up knowingly and with malice screwed a couple of us out of 1000$ each, we decided it was time mount a pay back campaign. not sure if it is still an option, but remember how the little magazine subsciption inserts that always fell out used to say "bill me later" next to the credit card info? well we spread out a individually amassed and filled out a pile of the raunchiest magazines we could find, then moved onto all the kid mags we could find, then on and on till we had a massive pile that he would have to slowly deal with for years to come. not satisfied yet, we moved onto to browsing the internet for as many sign ups as we could find starting with a nambla mailing list, na, aa, and various organ failure support groups akin to fight club, and so on... the list goes on and on... all calling his phone to remind him of the next meeting. finally, feeling tired of all the "paper work" revenge, we satisfied our need for some physical revenge by using a super glue syringe and some epoxy to effectively seal every truck and door lock we could get to from the outside of his house. story here: copied for easy reading: &gt;didn't walk in, but found out she was sleeping with a vp of our company and had planned a trip to napa valley over our anniversary, under the guise of a business trip. &gt;went to hr and homeboy was promptly fired, since she was under him (tee hee), and kicked her out of the house. this is a story about my ex wife sharron. i thought she was the love of my life. we met while i was in grad school, while she was working as an intern at the library i frequented, we clicked immediately and the rest was history. within 2 years we were married and living happily ever after. i worked hard to get where i am at the firm i work at. this included sometimes 60 hour work weeks but most of the time i was only working between 30-40 hours depending on the project w/ weekends off. she meanwhile just worked as 9-5's and never finished school up. we were members at a fitness club and she would increasinly spend time there more and more even though she just used it for the spa part and never really worked out. soon it was getting ridiculous she was also more and more guarded about her phone. so one night we were drunk and she passed out. then her phone buzzed and an unknown number popped up asking if i was gonna be at work the next day. she was smart and never had any messages saved over 2 days from him, but the texts were damning. i forwarded them to me and kept the information. the marriage was done right then and there, and to think we were gonna try for kids. i immediately withdrew us from the club which pissed her off and caused a huge fight but i said, "we have to save up for the baby and a new house" she reluctantly agreed. she never did have the best metabolism so this was bad for her. i then set up cameras in the house for future use of course in court. i just needed time to collect my thoughts and my evidence and plot. i went on "business trips" and recorded her fucking the guy in our bed. that was it for me i hated her. i spent the next 6-8 months buying greasy foods, more and more beer and loading our dinners with fatty foods and pasta/bread. each morning i would wake up early and get us donuts every morning for that time. she easily gained 25 lbs over that time-i gained like 10 lbs..totally worth it. i also did what i could to be the best husband ever over that time. i called her all sorts of things and treated her like a princess so she wouldnt suspect a thing. i made the most romantic gestures and made our 4 year anniversary a dream vaction of hers. i did everything she wanted in bed and indulged in her deepest desires. i brought her shopping almost bi-weekly and took her to the best restaurants. i wanted her to know how much i loved her, and would say things like "i would never hurt you, i would always love you, youre mine forever, were a team, etc and you feel the same way right?." i dont know if it was the extra weight or the romantic gestures but she seemed to stop going to him and was spending more and more time with me and "re-fell in love i suppose" now was the time to strike. after saving up quite a bit we had a serious talk about starting the process of having a kid, it sucked becuase this could have been one of the best conversations of my life but instead it became the focal point of my revenge. we would do this thing where we would send eachother a text about what we were thinking even if we were face to face, it originated in all that time in the library together and was reserved for romantic lovey dovey or sexual texts. long story short this kind of communication was very intimate and special to us. so right when we started to talk i said "sharron take your phone out" she knew what this meant and was grinning ear to ear, she probably thought i was gonna say something cute...instead i sent her a video. the look on her face was priceless. she couldnt speak she couldnt move she was paralyzed. she began bursting in tears and said she stopped seeing him 2 months ago, and that it only happened a handful of times. and that i worked too much and she was lonely and she was sorry and that he meant nothing and that we could move past it and have kids. she was a wreck. i told her she shattered my heart and that i could never forgive her and that she was everything to me. she was ecstatic. begging me to stay, saying she would do anything. i simply said no and that i already had a lawyer and that she could damn well bet that infidelity clause was gonna bite her harder than a bull shark. in the divorce i let her keep her car that i bought and all her assets, we had a split bank account since it was easier. i gave her the last 5 months on our lease and that was it. she got even bigger, and looks like shit now. she tries to contact me all the time but i just never respond best part she can see that its "read". i really dont have feelings for her at all she was in retrospect so selfish and only looked after herself and others if they suited her needs. her parents were class acts and were so sorry to hear what she did to me i doubt they even talk to her, my ex mol loved me. shes alone as far as i can tell and struggling, tbh i pity her and feel bad because she used to be beautiful. currently im not looking to date i'm 26 and in the best shape of my life making great money. i post all my fun times and frequently with with beautiful girls from vationing or clubbing or whatever im up to that given weekend. my new single life is actually amazing and ive found a new part of me that would have been lost with her. i shattered her soul, body, mind and heart by giving her everything and taking it away at the perfect time. nothing too elaborate but enough to inflict lasting damage. the revenge doesnt feel that good now since i barely think of her, but its nice everynow and then to see my greatest enemy be diminished to a spec. i had an extremely annoying client who either never wanted to pay me for my services (computer repair) or would be so nit-picky about everything that it was never worth my time to do anything for him. he ran a radio station (over the internet) that supposedly had several thousand listeners, and mainly played old r&amp;b, except on sundays which played gospel. he brought the computer that did the broadcasting in one day and wanted me to fix it. he would constantly get it infected with viruses, and has absolutely no sense whatsoever in using a computer but he insisted. he left it overnight, the problem was resolved within just a few minutes. i hit him with a $50 bill on it (because i hate him) which he immediately balked at. ok, i thought. let's do this then. i loaded up his software and broadcast this all night long. he was there waiting for me the next morning when i opened up, paid, left, and i haven't heard from him since.more than a few years ago, i used to work at a college that was, quite frankly, a travesty. nonetheless, i worked there helping students. i fancied myself as a bit of a programmer then and worked a deal with one of the students to reprogram his family's website. revamping photos, redoing layout and design, third party tools and services that were free so that they could have the functionality they wanted (for free) without a major spot of programming on a server that wouldn't let them have those services anyway (think super basic web hosting). the works. i did it for a cut-throat rate (cutting my own throat, that is) and after looking at the code, i told him "look, i know you guys did this in front page originally. after i'm done, with the things you want, you won't be able to update it with front page again because you'll break it." i told him this three or four times. he acknowledged it each time and i set to work. back at this time, front page couldn't handle complex code or layouts because anything more complicated than a table was trouble. if you tried to change it with front page, it might look right on the screen but it wouldn't work in the browser so there was no way to know until you saved over the original whether you broke it or not. each phase of the work elicited a great response. i would do a block of work and upload it to the server and he'd pay me. he went in there once to make a small change and totally borked the site. "you used front page, didn't you?" yup. "i'll fix it but it's going to cost you more because i told you not to do that and that starts going into support and maintenance which you don't want. you just want code, design and that's it." he agreed, coughed up the money ($50, whoopee) and then i went about working on the rest of the site. once i finished, however, he withheld the two final payments (about $300) and changed the password to the site so that i couldn't upload the final block of work and couldn't take down anything else i had already uploaded. basically he wanted it something like 90% of the way there and that was good enough for him and it didn't seem to matter much that he was basically stealing. i actually had halfway expected this because he was arrogant and abusive to people most of the time but you can only eat so much ramen before it started to turn your stomach and i was tired of not eating. i counted myself just fine with this for the most part. i mean i had already made a couple hundred off him and his family and it was more than i would have made if i hadn't done it. he didn't know everything on the site yet and hadn't used every part of it. he basically went to the links i sent him, agreed to the work and i moved on to the next part. cue the third party services, my ace in the hole. see, since he couldn't actually change the site anymore without front page totally mucking it up and breaking the whole thing and i had never given him the passwords to the third party services that literally covered his site, i went in and changed the third party content so that it displayed what a thief he was. i considered it fair play and even up. he never noticed. i swear months went buy and he never. even. noticed. eh, no big deal. at some point his family would notice and then he'd either have to explain to them *why* there were notices like that all over the place or have to explain to them how he stiffed me. i considered it done and over with. and on that, it was. i just resolved to never deal with him again unless i had to for work. turns out that i did indeed have to but not for a while. in fact, his abusiveness towards other people disappeared completely for a while and i began to wonder if he'd just turned over a new leaf because, you know, people can do that. i didn't feel one bit sorry for what i'd done, tit for tat. but i wasn't angry at him any more. the school year progressed and i began to feel a little sorry for him because he was starting to have all kinds of problems including with life in general. we ended up chatting once in a while again and he let me know that he was about to get a metric fuckton of old computers that were being retired from the college and wanted to know if i'd build some out of the working spare parts and any other working spare parts left over would be mine. i figured, hell, no way he can screw me on that one so i said sure (after verifying with the college that it was good and legit). so i picked up 16 computers that were old and failing, built about 5 working pcs out of it, delivered them back to him for him to sell. i got a whole footlocker's worth of spare parts (not including cases or power supplies). a few weeks later, he and i had been talking. he had a disability (it wasn't hidden) and there was a piece of software that he'd come into one of the labs to use (i worked multiple departments) that allowed him to finish most of his assignments and was targeted at people with his specific disability. it was something like $5000 at the time and the department head in charge at the time thought it was just fine to leave the install discs on the desks in the computer lab in case the cds were needed for anything. i told him, "look, i know you need this software and i know how much of a royal pain it is for you to bring yourself all the way across campus when you can put that on your laptop and use it in your dorm room. i'm not always there but the cds are on the desk. the lab staff know you and would think nothing of it if you were to bring in your laptop and play with the cd and whatnot." he got what i was trying to say (he said as much). i felt bad for the guy, you know? it didn't require activation, had no product key, etc. i made it clear that he should *not* do this while i was there because while i had no problem pretending that i didn't know he wanted it and would plan to copy it but that i also couldn't and wouldn't turn a blind eye if i caught him. i made that abundantly clear. he nodded and was still pretty grateful that i let him know all the same. about a month passed and he started becoming extremely abusive to everyone again but much worse this time. one particular day, i had had enough when i walked into the room and he started off with "okay, dumbass... blahblahblah-i-don't-remember-the-rest-because-of-all-the-abuse-he-spit-out". my eye actually twitched a few times... i didn't trust him anymore and walked up to the lady in charge of the security of that special software... "look, i know that cost about $5000 per disc and you've got them laying out there for any student to just walk away with." after a brief conversation where i had to actually work to get her to understand this, she finally agreed. a few days later, abusive boy was back in the lab. i nodded at him, he came over... "hey, that lady is going to lock up those cds. if you're going to bring your laptop in and copy it, you should probably bring it tonight. just make sure i"m not in the room." he smiled, and headed out of the room. about 30 minutes later, it was time to close up the lab. i had taken to checking the software every night because "i'll be damned if it's my neck on the line." lo and behold, one of them was missing. i sighed. i knew what he had done. i had told him very specifically to bring his laptop in, not to take the cd out, trying to help the poor guy out, right? the worst part about is that even though i knew it was him, i couldn't just leave knowing that there was a small chance it could have been someone else. i knew well enough that he'd actually bring it back but if it were someone else, it might never come back. i had to report it. i walked up to the main desk and reported the theft, told campus security "yes, i know someone was in that room, i know who it was. i doubt he took it all the same." hey, i wasn't too thrilled with the guy but i wasn't about to pin it on him if i didn't have absolute proof and i didn't know for a fact, just strongly suspected. campus security found him wandering around campus with the disc. he was kicked out of the college (his senior year) within the week with only 3 months left in the school year. turns out that, for various reasons, the money he spent there for classes was wasted because none of those credits were transferable (like i said, the college was a travesty).this is a story i debated whether to put in here or r/pettyrevenge. i decided this had some weight so ill put it here first but like there later on. this happened to me only this week so its nice and fresh in my mind. **backstory:** in need of work i asked around to my friends and then found out through a good friend of a mine that there was a place opening up ideal location and industry for me. i had lengthy chats with the owner of this new franchise that was opening up. i had more business experience than him so i brought them up to speed and went above and beyond helping him out before i was even employed by them as long as i was guaranteed a job. this was a franchise job that was based around commissions i would earn based on clients i would pull in. the job was supposed to start at the beginning of june. i had other commitments but i started shuffling all of them to fit around this job because at least situation wise it was perfect even if the wage was average. june comes around and im still waiting to hear from the owner. **nothing**. i chase him up and get told the franchise is not going ahead. 3 days later its suddenly going ahead again and so its all stations go from the end of july. fair enough delays can happen with new businesses. owner is worried about leaving his high paying job to take over secondary job in the franchise to help out as i would be only employee so i help out and reach out to friends with same skill set as myself so they can take his position and he gets to keep his high paying job. lets call owner d for douche and my friends g1 and g2. **current story:** myself and g1 get hired (no contract yet, important) to start advertising and walking around with flyers to advertise the new franchise. g1 quits their other job because of assurances of shifts/money/work with the franchise. during this advertising we get asked by the local council to move on as its illegal under those laws to do what we were doing but with a permit it would be legal. pass this onto d and move on from the area. g2 was interviewed and promised a job and work that myself and g1 were already doing. they were waiting on schedules and contracts to start but d was delaying and not answering phone calls. after the first venture to advertise i find out from g1 that d has decided to replace her (3 years of study and 4 years of experience) with a 18 year old girl (3 weeks study and no experience) and d has also been ducking my calls about this and the council. this being a job that g1 had left her only source of income for that fell totally down because d likes young **dumb** things (g1 was young and attractive but smart). activate anger stage 1. g2 was not contacted at all for weeks until the same afternoon that g1 was let go. telling her after guaranteeing a job, that she would not be able to work for them after all and apparently d was relying on me to fill shifts with the young dumb thing. all of this he was doing behind my back after i had gone out of my way so many times to help him including getting these girls on board and us putting many things on hold to help him. anger stage 2. before i had found out what he had done to g1 and g2 d had tried to get me to do the exact same thing with the flyers in a close region. i had protested as i had already been asked to leave the area before and d responded with &gt; whats the worst they could do? send me a letter? he was pushing very hard so i went and looked up the law. i found out going back there especially after a warning i could be fined $5000 if not be criminally prosecuted. i told d of this and he attempted to force me to still do this work but of course would not do it himself. kaioken x10 finally, i find out about all above situations and then also notice that he has been out working for his franchise. d, knowing im supporting a sick partner and struggling financially and even after going out of my way for months to help his business out and him as an individual (with no pay) he had decided to take every shift where a client could sign up and get commission which of course went straight into his pocket when he was already well off from his other job and refused to let me on board to do these other shifts. (cutting me out of hundreds of dollars) super saiyan. so for the revenge. * with the work he had tried to force me into i have all the copies of d's marketing materials he would use to encourage business for the future weeks. instead of blasting him about his unprofessional ism and general doucheyness i decided to email him i got a better job with better benefits and that i would be passing all marketing material onto g1 so she could keep encouraging business for him. (of course i 'dont know' at this stage he's been a horrible douche to g1 and go rid of her) he's faced with the choice of either having to personally confront her face to face after being a major dick to her or he looses thousands of dollars of marketing flyers and material. * i am a member of a close knit community within my industry and immediately put out an apb that this owner was a dick and noone should work for him in any fashion and should in fact encourage others to stay away from him. (community is well respected and known within industry) also should put out a notice to any potential clients or recent sign ups that they are likely to get messed around and treated poorly by said owner despite staffs best intentions. last thing you need right as your trying to get a franchise off the ground end to even break even (which i do know d was having trouble doing) * my favorite part of the revenge. the friend i heard about this job from attends the same religious community that d does. i took great satisfaction in informing this friend of every single one of d's antics and attitude including screencaps of him encouraging me to perform illegal activities and him not caring about me being fined etc. this friend is highly respected within his religious community and took it upon himself to inform the 'elders' of the community of how d is not acting within any of the guidelines of the community and will be severely reprimanded, if not excommunicated. this is also his entire network of personal friends who now get to find out just how poorly he treats those he would be responsible for. i would i have liked to do more but at least for now it will suffice. tl:dr franchise owner fucks me and my friends around after hours of unpaid work and so i go out of my way to ruin his reputation within the industry as well as within his personal reputation within his church community.yesterday someone posted a revenge story about lying to get a guy fired. the post had -330 something points and has now been removed due to breaking rule 3 on the sidebar. as a reminder, please keep stories non-serious. the post in question pretty much ruined a guy's life based on a lie. there were also a lot of comments which had been reported and only one of them was actually spam, the rest were just people disagreeing. please report comments and posts if they break any of the sidebar rules but please don't report something just because you disagree with them and feel a downvote isn't enough.i used to work in a martial arts supply store. the store was generally dead, and i used to leave a sign up, in the window that read, "back in 5". there were a couple of customers who would just drop by to chat, once in a while. one of them was named huey. huey had a tkd background. we sparred a couple of times, and our respective styles made it pretty interesting. suffice to say, he was fast. how fast? real fast. he dropped by my work for a chat, one day, and i decided to grab a coffee from across the street. cue the customary sign in the window. huey had come with one of those gargantuan gas station plastic soda cups, and had been sipping from it. i worked next to a very busy road, and was equidistant between the two places where a pedestrian could cross. well, fuck the law. we waited until there was a pretty good gap in traffic, and jogged across. a car pulled up on one of the side streets, when we were almost all of the way across, and turned onto the road we were on, and just gunned it straight for us. engine at excessive rpms, that thing was loud. i picked up the pace, and got out of its way, but not huey. huey planted both of his feet in the middle of the road, and i watched his veins start to bulge from his neck, as the driver had to rapidly apply his brakes and avoid huey. he honked and flicked huey off. fast as shit, huey hucked that monstrosity he'd been drinking from right at the car. dude's window was down, and i can't swear to it, but i think he got splashed. the driver braked, and slowed. surveying the damage or thinking about taking huey and i on; no idea. huey turned, to look at the car, and i noticed that his eyes had become bloodshot. that piece of shit pimped along, and we went for coffee.i had a plan to get vengeance on an acquaintance who stole a shit ton of soda from my great uncle's shop, but recently gained proof and acted on it. so this asshole, we'll call him jacob, would come in to my great uncle's shop(i worked there for summer break) would come in and walk suspiciously around the shop and would disappear from the surveillance camera's sight range momentarily. i purchased a sound receiving el cheapo from target, and set it up in a blind spot. almost a whole month passes, then he comes in again, and walks into the snack isles, and begins to grab a 24 case of soda(don't know what kind), and walks to the usual spot. he begins to shove it in his backpack, grunting, and it wouldn't fit the bag. i walked over the area, and see him trying to stuff this in his bag. i confront him and tell him he has to pay for the soda, and never come back. he tells me he has no money on him and tries to tell me some sob story about his dead grandpa or something that made him steal. i confiscate the soda, and put it back. i take his phone from his bag, and call his parents and try get them to come down to the shop. his parents don't answer, and i leave a message. he leaves, months pass, and he is back, with a friend. i tell him to leave, and he walks back to the snack isles, and begins to try and take more shit than last time, still unaware of the camera. i tell him to stay away from the shop, or i will call the cops, but of course, he is back again. i allow him in a few more times, but steal all merchandise back from his bag every time he arrives. he and his fat friend would go next door and leave their bags here. when he keeps coming back, enough becomes enough. i await his arrival, and take his bike from the rack, and place it in the road. first me and my friend take turns scratching it and pouring gasoline on it. we run his friends bike over with my truck, and burn the other. when they come back to the rack, i throw them out permanently and threaten to slap their shit if they come back. i haven't heard from them again.first off this is a throwaway account and a long post. i've been subbed to pettyrevenge for a while so i would think this story i'm about to tell is more prorevenge than petty. this memory is still fresh in my mind because the revenge that the cooks took was absolutely disgusting and they later had my back on my subsequent revenge against the same manager. theirs was extremely gross and unsanitary while mine crippled restaurant operations for a couple days due to lack of water. this is my first post to this sub. a sidenote, i don't condone messing with anyone's food. i never did when i finally rose the ranks and became a cook myself about a year or so later at a different restaurant in the chain. background: the year was mid to late 1990's and i was working as a dishwasher in my late teens right after high school. i had just left from a cashier position at a local home improvement chain that was big in my area when i was living in that area. it was a subsidiary of a local grocery store chain that has since expanded into several states. the home improvement chain has since closed since home depot started expanding at the time all over the country. anyways i quit that job and a friend got me a job at the restaurant. i applied for a pastry job and during my interview, the horrible gm asked if i didn't mind washing dishes for 2 weeks then he'd let me go on to do pastry. i thought that was a decent offer not knowing that he had absolutely no intentions of letting me do pastry. not knowing that tidbit, i took the job and ended up being a dishwasher/busboy for a year. when i learned that the gm had no intentions of holding up his end of the deal, i was furious but needed a job. /background **preface** at the 24 hour restaurant, two cooks i'll refer to as joe and mike, were two guys who were overworked and under appreciated. they'd get in around late lunch, had to work through dinner and bar shift until the early morning. these guys hated the gm. i was generally the dishwasher on their shifts and they took to me as one of their own. it was because they were friends with my best friend at the time who helped me get the job, i was the cleanest dishwasher, got them stacks of clean plates like clockwork, always left the dishwashing station extremely clean when other dishwashers didn't, i got shit if i even thought about leaving the area less than perfect while other dishwashers got away with being sloppy, other dishwashers could call in sick but i couldn't even if i was sick as a dog, they knew about me getting shafted on tips when i bussed tables since i confided in them, they knew about the gm screwing me over. basically these two cats really felt my pain. one day they had had enough and executed their revenge. **the revenge** one day the gm was being his usual asshole self to us and decided to order a cheeseburger or something of that nature from the menu for his break. joe and mike got into revenge mode. joe decides to dip the gm's burger patty into a filthy mop bucket a few times will mike went to go take a shit. if your imagination is running wild at this point as to where this is all going, it should. joe throws the burger on the grill and lets it cook for a bit, takes it off the grill and dips it a little more into the dirty mop bucket. mike finishes his business and after wiping his ass, takes some shit off his toilet paper and smears it all over the top of the burger then throws some cheese on that bitch. they cook it to temp, put it on some buns, plates some fries and calls out to the server telling them the food was ready. all three of us stand in the galley and watch as the gm gobbles down the mop bucket, shit smeared cheeseburger actually enjoying his food. grossest thing i had ever witnessed in person. even though they scrubbed the grills and stoves, from that day forward, i refused to order food from the place while on break. i went to local establishments to eat even though they told me i had nothing to worry about. tl;dr: cooks get revenge on a horrible boss by fixing him up a mop bucket dipped, shit smeared cheeseburger. supposedly the girl said she would get back at him somehow for all the lawsuits sterling's ex wife filed against her. i know this sub is just for stories of pro-revenge but this seems to be the biggest public revenge story ever. 2.5 mill fine, banned for life, forced to sell. background: my friend, zack, sells a lot of weed and mdma and has a very strong sense of justice. his friend of a few years, casey, is a real thug and just comes off like a real shady guy in my eyes. one day zack tells me (to no small surprise) that casey is refusing to pay a substantial sum of money to him. casey tells all his friends that zack is threatening him and all sorts of things to keep their friends on casey's side. casey then says that if zack ever tries to get his money back, that he will call the cops in on his operation (very easy considering casey's family affiliations). zack asks for my expertise in getting some revenge and i tell him that i'm not prepared to do what he asked but to keep me in the loop if i can help some other way. some time down the road, zack asks me about a guy i know (jim) and whether i can trust him. i tell him i should be able to and he lets me in on his plan. zack has got a substantial amount of bud that was grown in a rainforest and basically left to fend for itself. most of the bud got mouldy and the end product would have been near impossible to smoke. never the less, he kept the rotten stuff and dried it very quickly in a food dehydrator. it wasn't smokeable but it was still incriminating. then he let me know that jim was family friends with casey's family and had been left in charge of house sitting while the family was on vacation. jim makes a call to casey and says that "some guy called zach came round to pick up his stuff". casey springs into action and soon enough the police are investigating zach for claims of robbery, trespassing and dealing weed. they quickly found that zack had been at a wedding and visiting family in the time that this had happened and after being invited into his property, they found nothing out of the ordinary. then the police came to check casey's house. jim of course told them that the only call he had with casey in that time frame was about the family dog and when the police check casey's room (even though the door was still looked) they find a large quantity of pretty nasty, pretty illegal marijuana. casey is under investigation right now and it seems that the cops have found out he is dealing coke and ketamine. zack never got his money back but all of casey and zack's mutual friends are now coming to zack for business, which means he is making more than ever. i can't say i condone any of this but i did feel that while it was risky, it was good to see that casey's violent threats were met with a craftier revenge than vandalism or violence.so awhile ago i posted [asking for help]( long story short, the estate agents didn't own one of the fridges, the seven tenants of the house just 'sold' it on to the next set of tenants for £50 each year, and this year the 7 welsh lads moving in flat out refused to pay. since making the post, one of my housemates heard them talking about 'scoring a free fridge', so that confirmed my suspicion they were just calling our bluff and trying to get it for free, rather than just not caring.. i *tried* to donate it somewhere, no one offered to take it from gumtree before we left, and the local places either charged £20 or so collection fee, wouldn't take an old fridge, or would only take it if *i* could get it to the place, and the problem in the first place was that i had no way of moving it myself. so sadly, no one benefited from a fridge, however i have hopefully made sure the new tenants can use it as nothing but decor. based on the suggestions in my original thread, the day i left i turned everything off and cleaned it all out nice and neatly. then took absolutely everything that could be removed from it. the fridge/freezer now has no shelves in the main part or the door. because they could still just use it to refrigerate beer or something i slit the rubber band sealing thing in a dozen or so places, i have no idea if it'll do anything, but fingers crossed it'll make it leak cold constantly. the girl who moved in first out of us said it was still full of junk when she moved in, which means the estate agents don't look inside, which is great, because i lined both doors with half a tube of superglue that we'd used to fix a chair. finally, even though people said it would be too easy to fix, i cut the power cord almost completely through, left a little wiring still attached, right up near the base of the fridge, hopefully they won't even notice until they manage to pry open the door. tl:dr * new tenants refused to pay for a fridge as per everyone else had done; also found out they were in fact calling our bluff and expecting to get it for free. * cut the power cable near the base, it's not noticeable and is still attached, but should burn out after a little use. * removed all the shelves and containery things inside, there is nothing but the floor of the fridge and freezer compartment to put stuff on * cut the rubber seal on the door all over the place. * superglued the door shut. enjoy! asshole students. xdthink this goes here, as he got a heafty fine and jail time. so on to the story... after a baseball game, we stop in a mcdonalds to get some food. we get our food and get into my dad's truck. and indian guy pulls in next to us and throws his door open, denting my dad's car. well, my dad fixes dents for living, so no big deal really. except this guy kept trying to blame the wind. they start arguing, and this guy just will not let my dad just say "just give me $60 for my time and ill fix it myself" and begins swearing at me and my brother( very young, and not involved at all) and my dad damn near starts a fight with this guy, and he shouts "call the cops, they will defend me!" so my dad does. fas forward 15 min. and an unmarked cop car pulls in. one cop gets out, starts asking questions. he gets both sides, and asks me and my brother for what happened. we told him everything, and he starts writing this guy a ticket. the indian guy says "i fucking hate cops" and gives the cop the finger. my dad tells the cop, but he didnt see it, so no crime. *exceeeept...* the **second** cop, who saw it all, steps out, cuff out to put on this guy. indian dude tries to pull away and run, and all three large dudes grab this scrawny punk shit and cuff him. they send my dad on his way, and as we pull out, in the rear seat of indian dude's car, i see baloons. for a girl's 3rd birthday. my dad fixed the dent himself, it would have cost 100 dollars for anyone else. the indian got booked for some stuff regarding minors, resisting arrest, and a few others. probably a couple days in the slammer and a good couple hundred dollars in fines. edit: when he was getting ticketed, he apparently make some kind of threat towards the officer citing him and my father and i, thereby making his crime much more punishable.one sentence [story from a friend]( this morning.so the other day i was taking my girlfriend to work on my lunch break because her car broke down. because it was my lunch, i was strapped for time. i was speeding (not excessively) on the freeway, about 10 mph over and right as i am passing a big rig, he **(the asshole, not the big rig)** cuts me off doing 5 mph under the speed limit. he proceeds to tap his brakes just to be an asshole so i go around him and get in front of him. doing this somehow upset the man and he decided to follow me. me, being the nice guy that i am, waited until we were on the junction between two freeways to break check him to the point where he had to skid to stop in time. me and my girlfriend let out a chuckle and continued to go to her work. she works at a restaurant right across from the mall in our town. so not wanting this crazy to know where she works; i take her to the closest spot near her work and tell her to walk straight across the 6 lane intersection and i will ditch this dude. she does this, and at this point he caught up to me, and rolls down his window yelling at me trying to get me to get out of my car. i simply don't have time for this fuck-head so i plan to lose him through the city (my hometown) before heading back onto the freeway and going back to work. as soon as i pull out of the parking lot, there is a motorcycle cop right in front of me. so i whistle at him, doesn't phase him; so i honk. he merges over to the lane next to me and stops at the red light. i roll down the window, "hey buddy, there is this crazy guy in the brown truck a couple cars back that is trying to fight me or something. he cut me off on the freeway a few miles back and followed me to the mall where i had to drop my girlfriend off for work. i don't have time to deal with this guy right now. can you help me out?" his response was, "the toyota?" i nod, thank him and drive off. looking in my rear-view, i see the cop wait for him to catch up to me, then immediately light his ass up. i immediately pull my phone out to call my girlfriend to inform her of how awesome that was.in 2013, myself and a large group of friends went to a music festival. there was one girl with us (i'll call her rachel....because that was her name.) who was not a part of the insular group of friends. she was a friend of one of the people in the group, but none of the rest of us had ever met her. so, we get to the mountain and set up camp. my friends and i decide to go see a dj. rachel does her own thing and separates from us. we arrive at the very top of the mountain and have fun for a few hours, and decide to return to camp. when we return, we all observe rachel straight up in my tent, looking for valuables. however, this was not my first rodeo, and i made sure to keep my camera, all prescription medications, etc. in a backpack and with me at all times. the entire group immediately confronted her. she was making excuses that were altogether unfounded, saying that she was on drugs and had gotten confused and thought that she was in her own tent. her tent looked and had an interior nothing like mine though. the most glaring example was that mine had a sleeping bag inside it and hers had an air mattress. there were many other examples, and during the course of the confrontation, her story evolved so we all knew that she was lying. fast forward about 24 hours in the future. rachel is sleeping soundly in her tent. now, another friend of mine is a new mother, and has a breast pump on her. she has been pumping for the last 24 hours and putting the milk into a jar, saving it. we go in her tent where she is asleep, and my friend pours her half rancid breast milk all over this chick's face. but, we are not done with the revenge there. rachel did not wake up after having milk splashed on her, so i go back in there and grab her bag. i never had any intent of stealing anything out of it, that's just not me. but, i did take it into a porta potty, and took a huge dump in it and then returned it to her tent! about 6 hours later, she wakes up and grabs her purse and exits her tent and we are all really mean to her....so she packs up all of her stuff and leaves the festival, never noticing that her purse is full of poop. we all had a great laugh session over this, and it is kind of a big deal type story around where i live. (dc)not my story, but a family members, who i shall call tommy. tommy was in a bar in the united states about 10 years ago to watch a college football game with a bunch of business partners. the bar was very crowded and while outside smoking, a fight broke out nearby. the overzealous bouncers started tossing people around and tommy, who was just standing there innocently, got tossed. literally tossed. he fell over a railing, onto concrete about 6 feet down. he gashed his face, broke his hand, and when he tried to get back in to get his possessions, was told to fuck off before he was arrested. his friend tried to get his jacket from their table inside, but it was gone. i don't know if he pursued legal/police action, but i assume he did and was unsuccessful. otherwise the following tale would not have occurred. fast forward 3 years. hand/face healed (after a few expensive surgeries) and new jacket purchased, but tommy still harbors a burning desire for revenge deep inside. he finds out he will be going back to the area for business (he lived elsewhere). just so happens that the super bowl will be occurring this same weekend. so tommy starts to plan. and what he comes up with is perfect. on super bowl sunday, following a week of successful business, he shows up at the bar. it is near the end of the first half, game very close, with a bag containing his supplies at his side. everyone is captivated by the intensity of the game and he slinks off to the mens room. it's a ghost town. inside, he quickly dons dish gloves and starts plugging up the sinks and overflowing them. he shoves tennis balls inside the toilets and jams them all the way inside and flushes them to overflow as well. i am not exactly sure the extent of work that went on beyond this, but he did something to make the water flow continuously and was difficult to stop. soon there is an overflow of watery piss/shit dumping onto the floors. work complete, he exits the bathroom and takes up a vantage point nearby. halftime whistle blows and everyone rushes for the bathroom with the intensity of adrian peterson blasting through tackles. bladders are full and must be emptied. he could only speculate on what occurred inside, but its quite apparent that it's cluster fuck. guys come running out, shoes wet and squishing, flagging down staff/looking for other places to piss. there are staff running around trying to stop the overflows and get the toilets operational, while still serving the packed bar, but it is too late. the scene becomes more chaotic and tommy, proud and satisfied with himself, slinks away. i believe they had to shut down the bar for the night after that. there was a lot of water damage and revenue lost. i don't know if there is a moral to this story, maybe keep your dogs on a leash, or never callously fuck over a paying patron. i do know that tommy is a cold, calculating mother fucker and he takes great pride in this. either way, i know who i am consulting if i ever need to exact revenge. tl;dr tommy gets seriously injured by bouncer, comes back years later and destroys bathroom/ruins superbowl for bar/causes thousands in damage.if there's so many stories that get posted to here with many saying it belongs in /r/pettyrevenge and vice-versa, why isn't there a sub just called /r/revenge? that would mitigate a lot of squabble on which post goes where and such. x--posted from [/r/pettyrevenge]( so this is something i do whenever i get one of those "im out of town, my assistant is going to send you a check/money order" scams. if you dont know how this scam works, they send you a fraudulent check or money order and you deposit into your bank hoping that you will give them the item that day, when it usually takes a bank a few days to catch that its fraudulent. i accept that i will take the check/money order. and have them send it to a certain address (see images for address). 9/10 times they send it, and ive been contacted by the fbi looking for more information. (sorry for the imageshack host - imgur doesnt like my computer or vice versa): [image 1]( [image 2]( [update 1](seriously, i'm not trying to be a jerk, but i don't get it.i guess my son was in the second or third grade circa 1998 and there was this kid (jt) that picked on him constantly. fairly certain the torture wasn't physical as my son was big for his age and taking martial arts. it was mainly verbal stuff, name calling etc. the kid was a handful because i remember his desk was on the other side of the room from the other students and he ate lunch isolated. anyway me son went to a different middle school than jt so there was a break in time when he around this kid. so a few years pass and my son had been playing football for several years as a linemen playing both ways. so you see where this is headed. one beautiful fucking day jt shows up late to practice and a few days into the start of practices. i was giddy as hell. my son to this day is very mild mannered so i was wondering what was going to happen. well i guess the gods of karma were with him this fine day. damned if they didn't put jt across from my son on the line. i honestly don't remember whether he was playing o-line or d-line but when they snapped the ball my boy ran over jt like he was a tackling dummy. this happened a few more times until jt would ran away from my son like he was wielding an axe. needless to say that was jt's last practice. my ex and i broke up in may of last year. recently i hooked up my computer for the first time to the internet. my current boyfriend was cleaning up a lot of junk from it for me and came across a dropbox logged in. he thought it was mine it was pictures of me and my ex. after looking through it more we found hundreds and hundreds of pictures my ex took of girls without their permission. women bent over at work, drs office, water theme park, fairgrounds, park. we also found pictures he'd taken of girls underage around the age of 10. all the girls/women were clothed but they were all zoomed in on their butt, or chest or crotch area. ewwww!!! i'm so grossed out. i filed a police report they are going to charge him with voyerism in 2 different counties (where the pics were taken). i contacted his ex wife know because they share custody of their daughter. now a cps case worker is going to contact me to get details. i also reported him to hr at his work and they are investigating and if found guilty he will be fired as well. to clarify i'm happy he's going to get what he deserves. people like this don't get caught often enough. my ex was abusive to me and verbally abusive to my daughter. if he has no problem hitting women, treating kids like he does and taking photos the way he did what else is he willing to do? will it escalate to more then that? sounds like the makings of a rapist to me. he ruined his own life. karma is a bitch! to the people who think he didn't do anything illegal: i'm in wa state btw rcw 9a.44.115 voyeurism.

through the warped tour message boards and hit it off pretty quickly. we would send long comments/messages to each other all day everyday. we had a lot of the same interests, i enjoyed talking to him, and i thought he was extremely cute. i naturally started to like him but once i found out his age i knew he'd just see me as jailbait and i got upset. at the time, like all 16 year olds think, i thought i was mature for my age and i was different, which in some ways i was. i had been through a lot but i still wasn't mentally grown and that's okay, nobody really has to be at that age. eventually we met, b drove all the way to pennsylvania from michigan to see me. he won over my grandma whom i lived with despite how old he was, he's really good at that. the women in my family always dated older anyway so in a way they thought they didn't have much to say. for the first year and a half we dated long distance, b would come to see me about every three weeks and we talked constantly when he wasn't around, i truly thought this was something that would last. when i was 17 b proposed to me in a best buy parking lot and i thought i was going to spend the rest of my life with him. when i was just shy of 18 i dropped out of high school and moved to michigan to live with him and his mother since i didn't like where i lived and had a lot of family problems. all was fine and dandy for a while, b and i formed a serious band together. i had always wanted to sing in a band, it was always very important to me but i was never a good singer but the plan was to get vocal lessons and work my hardest to improve. i started to not wanna be with him anymore in early 2011 so i spoke to him about it and he told me that if i left him he would have to kick me out of the band and the band was so important to me that i tried for the next few years to work it out. i was unhappy pretty much the entire time but anytime i tried to leave him he would bring up the band or bring up the fact that him or i would never find anyone better for each other and if i left him i'd probably regret it so i stayed out of fear. when i got around to 20 years old i really started to outgrow him, he's extremely immature for his age and everything that made him cool when i was 16 made him annoying to me now. the band went on to do a lot we recorded studio albums, went on tour, played warped tour, etc. i became a much better singer than i was at the start, i took four years and counting vocal lessons with a grammy nominated instructor and i became someone he took seriously as a singer. i worked my ass off. last year i started to become very depressed with where i was at in life, i still didn't drive because nobody would take the time to teach me and i didn't have family out here, i couldn't hold a job because b would have us doing useless tours and the more we toured the worse the tours got, i remember playing to many empty rooms and feeling hopeless. i started liking other people i met this one guy and sadly ended up cheating on b and i'm not proud of it but after that i realized i needed to get out of my relationship with b, i just felt scared and trapped and realized i was pretty emotionally manipulated by him at this point. i confessed what i had done to b and told him we should break up, at the time i was still living with him and he said as long as i payed rent i could continue to live there and we would still be in the band together and be good friends, it would just take time but he wanted me to get back on my feet. b cried over me for about a week and then started liking this other girl, we'll call her m, m was 17 years old and by now he was 30 years old, i was shocked but i shouldn't of been because i was 16 and he was 25 when we first got together. i was actually friends with m at first, she had became a fan of our band about a year prior and i always thought she was cool, her and i shared the same views on a lot of things or so i thought. b and m were happy together, it was pretty messed up but i decided that since b was so mentally immature that maybe it was okay and i wanted to see him happy because i had still felt bad for leaving/cheating on b at the time. not too long after b and m started to get on my nerves, she would come over to the duplex b and i lived at and she would hang out with him and i would usually leave because the duplex had no doors and i wanted to give them alone time. one night i set up a date during the same time and day so they could be alone, i didn't have an issue with that because i liked them both and was happy for them. my clothes were still in b's room so while i was about to get dressed i went over to kind of let them know beforehand that i was gonna come in real quick to get my clothes so i could get dressed, i peered over a tiny bit and they were both laying in his bed with no shirts, i found it pretty disrespectful and i was upset because i made plans to leave the house for them. after that situation things had settled down between everyone or so i thought. things went alright for a week or two after that and i was told i had to leave every wednesday from 12pm - 3pm so they had some time together, i think she was sneaking to see him between classes. normally i wouldn't mind except one week i had the flu but my ex still forced me out and i sat in a coffee shop for three hours since i couldn't find anyone to hangout with me and i wasn't driving at the time. not too long after that m absolutely lost her shit with me, she started posting things on her tumblr about how i'm a cunt and i'm never going to do anything with myself and was trying to force b to throw me out and i at the time had nowhere else to go considering going back to my abusive family wasn't an option. b did his best to stay neutral which i appreciated but that also didn't last long. soon after he gave me a move out date of june 1st and it was around march at the time so i had threeish months to get my shit together, i was a little nervous but i hoped i could do it. at least b was giving me three months instead of listening to m and kicking me out as soon as possible. one night b and i got into a fight pretty badly, i don't really remember what it was about but i'm sure it had something to do with anything i posted above. i lost my temper and told him i wasn't going to leave the apartment for m and him tomorrow and he told me that if i didn't i could, "get the fuck out" and that i were not eat any of the food in the house and i could "fucking starve". i was at my wits end with this bullshit, especially coming from a 30 year old man, a man eight years older than me catering to his cry baby brat 17 year old girlfriend, so i told him to stop messing with me or he would regret it. he laughed in my face and told me to try. so i went to bed and laid there and thought of exactly what i was going to do and i thought of the perfect plan and the next day i would set everything into motion. the next day she came over during her usual time and i left without a fight. when i got back she was just about to leave and he was about to go to work, i believe he was closing that night or at least working late so i had a lot of time. i start my plan by going through his ipad and getting every evidence i could to show how disturbing he was. of course his password was the day they started dating so getting into it was no issue. i read so many texts about how awful i was and how they didn't care if i got kicked out, i was furious but i kept my cool. i also listened to a lot of voice texts where he talked to her like she was a 6 year old girl and it was very creepy, unsurprised though because he used to do it to me. he also hundreds of screen capped snapchats from her including a few nudes which is very illegal. i took all this information and gave my mom a call (at this time we had forgave each other for our abusive past relationship), she was a little in the loop about what was happening and i knew she was a smooth talker so i told her that maybe she should give m's mom a call and let her know exactly how creepy b actually is since m still lives with her parents. the next step was finding m's mother's phone number, we'll call her j, j was one of those people who had her phone number in her facebook "about me", perfect. i was hoping it was the right number, i sent it to my mom and my mom told me she would call me back and let me know what went down. i anxiously waited for about 40 minutes and then the phone rings, it's my mom. my mom was on the phone with her mom for 40 minutes talking about the entire history of b and how b corrupts young girls and though j knew it all along she didn't wanna forbid the relationship and push m closer to b. so after my mom called j, j wanted to speak with me. i also went over my relationship with b to j and covered how manipulative, controlling, and creepy b was and i also told her all the texts i read. as soon as m got home that day j told her that if she continued to see b she would kick her out of the house, take her car, and not pay for her schooling. so m broke it off with b and apologized to me. for the next few whenever i was around m i would poison the well and remind her how awful b was every time. b was miserable for awhile and it was fun to watch since he made me so miserable, i thought it was good karma. they never ended up getting back together even though m wishes she could, i think b is over it at this point but i'm just glad i gave myself a little more time to get back on my feet and proved to b not to mess with me. b still goes after young girls, sadly that will never change, he likes to find girls he can manipulative and mold into exactly what he is. **tl;dr: my ex in his 30's goes after a young girl again, they tried to kick me out on the streets so i tell her mom everything and her mom makes her daughter break up with him.** edit: formatting i was unaware this sub existed, thought i'd share with anyone who didn't see the thread in r/pr. ***tl;dr.*** *bitch threw bleach on my clothes in the dryer and she got what was coming to her.* i joined the air force in 2010 and went to my first duty station in 2011. i was stationed at osan air base. anyway, between joining and getting to osan, tech schoolers usually spend much more on nice things then they probably should. i, too, fell into this trap. i had been poor for the last few years, so having a steady income was great. i purchased neat shirts with a bunch of air force and career field regalia on it. well i settled in nicely to my first duty station, made some friends and even had a girlfriend. things were pretty good. girls, sometimes very catty, end up in petty disputes. my girlfriend was not immune to this. this girl, we'll call her **b**, was passively fighting with my girlfriend **l**. one day, someone stole **b**'s fleece jacket out of the dryer while she was away from her laundry. this wasn't uncommon; people left their laundry in the community laundry room and accomplished errands on their day off. unfortunately, because of the fighting between my **l** and **b**, my girlfriend was probably first to be blamed. i can attest that she never had her fleece because, 1) she had her own, and 2) i never saw a third fleece around either my room or hers. anyway, sometime in the early spring of 2012, **b** decided to get back at **l** for [not] stealing her fleece jacket. **l** decided to get some of my laundry done and because she was a night shift worker she did her laundry overnight. like a great girlfriend, she threw in some of my things too, including my uniforms and pricey, tech school t-shirts. when **l** joined me in bed for a bit, before i woke up early in the morning (this is when she planned to pull my laundry out and give me a fresh sand-tee to wear to work), **b** threw bleach in the dryer on (mostly) my clothes, ruining it all. i suppose it could have been anyone. **l** said she had seen her up and about while **l** was doing stuff and hanging out with other night-shifters. later on we did catch wind from one of her fickle friends that gave us some circumstantial evidence to further our assumption, nothing concrete however. my clothes were ruined. **l** lost some stuff too, unfortunately it was mostly my stuff. there wasn't much room for recourse because i didn't have any concrete proof, and my first sergeant (the sympathetic uncle in the military family, if you will, who has some pull between family members) was unwilling to do much about it. ______________ fast forward to about an hour ago (10:00a.m. cst), my (now) ex-girlfriend **l**, who is still on good terms with me, messages me out of the blue. they're currently deployed together somewhere in the desert. she had this to say to me: "hey just wanted to tell u what happened to me today...**b** is deployed with me and someone was doing laundry today...just letting u know when she walked away i kinda maybe spilled a little bleach in her washing machine. thought that would make ya smile. l8r" today, justice was served.when i was in 7th grade, this kid was telling others i was a cocksucker. i couldnt get him to stop so i resorted to drastic measures. i had a pencil in my hand. now, its not what you think - id been suspended several other times for defending myself from bullies and i had no intentions whatsoever of causing any real harm or anything. the fucking pencil had no lead and you couldnt write with it or anything. if i had hit him anywhere else with it, i guarantee you nothing would have happenned. but, me being a stupid fucker, i accidentally hit him in an artery on his arm. the stupid pencil is latched on like glue and blood is literally squirting 6 inches in the air like a fucking movie. somebody even fainted. long story short, i get a 2 week suspension reduced to 3 days, he gets a 2 week suspension and counseling. also, when i was suspended, because i wasnt in school, i was allowed to go with my dad to a kickass air show nearby. upon return, lots of people told me thanks for doing that to the kid as he was the token "dumbshit" of our school.i've spent many years working in the general aviation industry. basically, working with private jets, the crews, and the principals. because of my location, we get a lot of political activity every four years. as the various candidates get out and start traveling around, it's in large part a non-event. they are on standard biz aircraft and not much is required in terms of special handling. that all changes when one of these folks becomes "the" candidate. now, they're rolling around on commercial jet aircraft (737/md80), they have a bunch of staff, and the requisite protection to go along with it. ok, no problem. our crew was very experienced, did a lot of large aircraft sports charter, and serious vip work. we had all the appropriate equipment to service these airplanes (ie: stair trucks, baggage carts, belt loaders, etc.). we also knew how big these airplanes are, and how to maneuver and park them on the ramp. believe it or not, at this level, aircraft handling is an art. there's no straight line or jet way to pull up to. you basically get one chance to get it right. in this last election cycle, we were getting the challenger to the throne in very regularly. like one to three times a week. ok, a little bit of a hassle, but from an airplane standpoint, no big deal. by and large, everyone involved was reasonable and friendly. the issues came about due to the fact that the members of the protection detail were always changing. this was especially true of the agents in charge. my understanding from talking to them, is that they were on a set rotation schedule to keep everyone fresh and on their toes. as far as we were concerned, a simple confab with the saic about the details for the day was sufficient. we would be clear on what they needed and we would handle the aircraft accordingly. this usually revolved around how many cars, busses, equipment trucks, etc., that they had and where we were going to put them. remember, along with this, we're also trying to handle a constant flow of regular biz jets coming and going. so, coming up with a mutually beneficial plan was pretty key. all is well and good, until one day, saic richard cranium is on the case. he wasn't particularly old, but he reminded me a lot of sherriff jw pepper, louisiana state poe-leese. from the bond movies. you know the type, "alright, alright, everybody stand back. i'm in charge here!!". the other ramp lead and myself just looked at each other in an "oh, great..." kind of way. it was either this guys way or the highway. he didn't want to hear or discuss anything about anything. ok, fine, whatever. so the plane comes in empty to pick up the candidate. we get the plane fueled and serviced, two sets of truck mounted airstairs, two baggage belts for loading luggage into both holds, the whole deal. plane is ready and waiting. easy peasy, lemon squeezy. so, the press busses and the luggage/equipment truck arrive. no problems, everything going well. get them on the plane, bags loaded, cool. now, i don't know what this guy's last assignment was, but this wasn't af1 where all the principal has to do is get out of the car and get on the plane and go. this candidate was always coming with several cars, staff members, additional luggage, promo stuff, etc. nothing unusual or unexpected. well, once we had the plane serviced, this saic went took it up about a thousand notches with the "i'm in charge" bit. when he got the call that the motorcade was 15 minutes out he decided that he was going to quarantine the entire ramp and make it a sterile area. no ifs, ands, or buts about it. the ramp was now off limits to anybody who wasn't approved, and none of us were approved. as we were very familiar with this particular operation, i calmly tried to inform him that the principal always had additional items for the plane, etc. nope! nope! everything's on the plane, they just need the candidate. ummmm, ok, i think it may be wise... nope, sterile area, not authorized, stay out, i'm in charge here! ok, buddy. you've got it! (with a big ass smile). i had really had it with this guy at this point, i could see the hole he was digging for himself, and felt our team had done all we could to avoid the coming problems. so, sure enough. the motorcade arrives, 10 cars/suv's, luggage, boxes of promo stuff, and other crap. this is where we would usually be standing by to unload the cars and get everything on the belt loaders and into the cargo holds. as we weren't there, the folks in the cars just dumped it all on the ramp. realizing that nothing was happening, the protective detail now starts grabbing the stuff and trying to figure out how to get it on the plane. meanwhile, 10 of us were just standing there in our glass line office watching, smiling, loving it. right about then, saic richard cranium starts losing his mind. not only did his guys have to try and load the plane, he was now realizing that the plane still had equipment all over it. he rushes into the building and starts getting on one of our csr's about how we're messing him up, and he can see us all "standing around with our thumbs up our butts". finally, i walk out to the desk, and calmly yet somewhat patronizingly ask him what the problem is, and ask if i can help him. guy is literally foaming at the mouth, and starts going off about the bags, and the trucks, and the equipment, and why are we all standing around. at that point, i smile politely, and remind him that he had personally restricted the ramp and ordered my staff out of the area. of course, i am here to help him, and if he wants to reconsider his prior position, i was confident that i could find some staff to finish loading the aircraft and remove the equipment so that they could depart. he just glared at me, and said "do it". two minutes later, the plane is secure, the equipment is gone, and plane is spooling up. have a nice day! buh bye!so i was in my 20's and had a good group of friends. we alwasy hung out at one guys house on weekends. his dad was rich and had a epic party house. there about 20 to 30 people there every weekend. one asshat started showing up, friend of a friend kinda deal. well the guy he always came with moved away but asshat kept coming over on weekends.. he was a fast drunk and turned insulting and mean to people he didnt know that well and always rude to the girls that where there.. we got tired of him fast and when he got drunk he would sleep in his car till the morning. (at least he didnt drive drunk).. to get rid of him one night my friends and i decided on a plan.. asshat came over on sat like normal, drank and got rude with in a few hours like normal, went to sleep in his car like normal.. but this time when he was sleeping in his car we disconnected the battery from the car and taped black plastic tarp over all the windows.. i left about midnight but i heard the next morning he was screaming in his car for about 5 min till he figured how to get out in pitch black. asshat even called the cops to report my friends. cops came and they told cops what they did.. cops laughed and said there was nothing they could do.. never saw asshat again..what do you do when the person making everyones life a misery at a company is the general manager who reports directly to the owners? very little is the actual answer. even here in the uk where we have pretty good employment laws. everyone becomes so afraid of losing their job that no-one speaks out. this guy is the sort to come out onto the floor and shout directly into your face if he has some problem with you. a little man who came over from india with nothing but a suitcase and an incredible attitude. his parents live in india in a house with servants, so i suspect he has seen power in action. he believed that british men were lazy and didn't want to work. he passed down edicts like no-one is allowed to talk about anything except business unless it is break time. i saw him shout at a young girl once. she was a single mother. he was shouting that the only reason he didn't fire her was because the child had no father to support it. that kind of bullshit, everywhere on a daily basis. my revenge? i'm not sure whether this is pro or petty revenge, but it felt good at the time. the handle to his office was one of those round ones, just a ball of metal. on nightshift i blew ink from two biros onto a piece of card and rubbed it on the underside of his door handle...gave it a nice coating of thick blue pen ink. i wasn't there to see it next morning but he unlocked his door and put his keys back in the pocket of his nice cream sports jacket. ink all down the side panel. man, he blew a gasket that day. and because he didn't initially know where the ink had come from he managed to get more of it on his shirt once he took his jacket off! everyone was talking about it for days...although i never could take the credit at the time.so, just a quick one from my dastardly friends archives of revenge. same guy as /r/prorevenge/comments/1isnlu/fish_sauce_for_fuckwits/ ...oh the stories i can tell. so... my friend is all dressed up and ready for a night at the club. pre-drinks at the pub have been done and the whole group is feeling super happy and looking forward to a night of dancing and more. everyone gets to the club, usual cue and wait to get in. they let the girls go in first together and the the guys go to follow. one of the bouncers 'decides' that my friend is 'too drunk' to go in and even though all the girls and the other guys that just went in in front of him were fine, he can't go in. so it's too late and everyone else has already paid to get in and he's left in the cold out in the street. not taking a kicking lying down my friend devises a plan. he heads around the back of the club, down the alleyway, and jumps the fence into the back area. it is closed up and dark but he soon finds what he's looking for. using a bit of wood lying around he smashes the lock handle of the electricity breaker box and opens it up... then he turned off all of the power switches for the whole building in seconds! he said the screaming that came from inside the club was insane. quickly he jumped the fence and headed back down the alley to the front of the club. by this time people are streaming out and he milled around with them until he met up with his friends. they headed off for a different club and had a great time. i don't know if he told the people he was with what he did that night, but it really wouldn't surprise me if he never said a word. i worked at a diner for my first job as a fountain guy, meaning i whipped up and served malts, shakes, pies, cakes, etc. i worked with desserts, basically. it was definitely a sweet gig for my first job. one beautiful spring day, i am invited to the birthday party of a girl i know. this girl was particularly special to me because we were basically in that stage that comes before a relationship, you know? like where both of you know that you're going to date soon. so you can imagine that going to her birthday party was important to me. her and i are still together, by the way. the problem with going to her birthday party is that i worked that day. i started asking about for a co-worker to cover my shift. no one that worked there regularly could cover it for me, however, my manager informs me of one guy who might be able to cover my shift. we'll call him douche. douche doesn't work at the diner anymore, but he still covers shifts when he is able (comes in maybe three or four times a year). i call up douche, who is my last hope at this point, and ask him to cover my shift because i've got my girlfriend's birthday party to attend. he says he'll do it, and i was thrilled. fast forward to the day of my girlfriend's party, and douche sends me a text saying he can't make it because he spontaneously developed strep on the day of. i'm suspicious, so i call him and ask him to tell me what's up. he lied. he was too high to go into work. douche then asks me to tell the managers for him. "oh sure, douche. no problem. thanks for being honest, man." i went to my girlfriend's birthday party anyway. douche knew he had a commitment and decided to get high regardless, so he deserves whatever he gets for being that moronic. not only that, but he calls me on the day of my prior engagement and expects me to drop everything because he couldn't resist the urge to roll a blunt? i threw him to the sharks (managers) happily. he lost his not-really-a-part-time-job. i was pleased. tl;dr - asked a guy to cover my shift for work to go to my girlfriend's birthday, calls me saying he is too high to go on the day of, i get him fired from his uber part-time job.happened 6 years ago. in my new town in the leafy suburb of happy valley. in june 2010, i closed on my down size house in the town next to where i been living most of my life. 2 kids were gone, and the other 2 were on their way to jobs and careers. wifey poo and i bought the final house for working and then our retirement. things were good. within 2 weeks of closing i was diagnosed with prostate cancer and my knee broke down and required a replacement. i was walking with a cane especially when doing stairs. i took to driving my car around the back of my house because the back steps were only 2 instead of the 4 steps in the front. almost immediately the code enforcement officer got on my case. the town had a new no parking rule over dirt. cars needed to be parked over an imperious substance like blacktop or stone. environmental reasons and social justice warriors on the town council had passed this local law recently at the urging of the old fat mayor. the code enforcement guy ticketed me after a couple of warnings. i had continued to park near my back door on the dirt. {he had been in construction, and was out of a job and friends with the fat mayor.} i post phoned the court date until after both surgeries (prostate removal, and knee replacement) had happened. appeared before the local magistrate /judge. pleaded not guilty. the local prosecutor tried the case pretty well. for first time offense the code enforcement officer told of his work in spotting me parking in my own back yard multiple times. the judge bought it and fined me $1,000. first time offense. i appealed, and had to pay $400 dollars for the court transcript. unfortunately for the judge and the code enforcement officer, a different party won the mayor and council majority. and the new thin mayor didn't care for the judge nor the code enforcement officer. nor did the mayor think it was funny when i handed him the court transcript. he agreed it was overkill. i (mostly) won on appeal. fine reduced to $250, the county appeal judge said he had a handicap sticker on his car. would i please apply for a doctor's letter and show it to the local police chief. yes, this happened, now i could legally park any place in my yard without recourse from the town. prorevenge part: oh yes, the judge and the code enforcement officer. the judge lost his appointment, the thin mayor didn't like him. the judge subsequently ran for mayor on a third party line and came in last. the code enforcement officer was down sized in short order and soon un employed and without the town pick up truck he drove. {he had been in construction most of his life, and there was no work available at this time, so the town job had been a godsend.} n.b. in my experience, when people do bad things to one person, they usually do it to more than one person. so i was just a major push in helping 2 town official lose their jobs. {thank you mr. thin mayor} plus it is good to complain about bad government service to the highest local authority. been parking in my back yard near my back door for 6 years. like the convenience. edit 1: prostate, not prostrate, spelling. can't always spell. can laugh at my mistakes. edit 2 loved when the appeals judge forced the town to pay me back $750. made a copy for my records. edit 3 prostate cancer is nothing to laugh at. men should have their psa checked. in answer to /u/rambowe about sexual problems. i suggest you tag: sir andrew lloyd webber prostate problems post operation. he has some things to say about it. edit 4: **tl, dr** special snowflake, {m69, dink, } thinks he is getting away with stuff. called out by redditors, was not even revenge, some said. did take some advice and lay down stone to park car in back of house. still a happy camper, and enjoyed all the posts. first of all, i do not know how appropriate this story is but i want to share it with you. there was this guy from primary school, who was a total jerk to me right from the moment we first met. he would make stupid jokes and comments about everything (remember, i was 7 or so, even the most dumb shit can used as an insult). i was a shy boy, and had trouble becoming friends with others, but i had a few and this jerk would tell lies in order to disrupt our friendship. and since he was one of the top students (maybe even the best) my teacher wouldn't believe me. anyway, after we graduated from primary school we both ended up in the same class of the same (high-?)school. for me it was like a new chapter since there were some people i already knew and was friends with and i decided to stop being lazy and my grades became better. jerk couldn't stop mocking me or trying to break my friendships (well his tactics were less effective since i knew then and was prepared, also i got used to be a little bit of a loner). one day i had the idea how fight him back (i could hit him since i was stronger, but that did not seem to be the right thing for me). we got our math exams back and i had a slightly better grade than him and i could see his anger in his eyes. he couldn't believe/accept that it was me who was better than him. so i decided to get better in every class, i even got 12 of 11 or 57 of 55, but that's a different story. and finally, in the 8th grade i accomplished my goal, i became the best student puff my class, which till then always was jerk, my friends congratulated me and our teacher gave me an ice cream, in class, a magnum, and i had the permission to eat it in class. he never ever brought any present before nor after. it was like the cherry on top of your cream that he brought the ice cream at that day. jerk was furious, he also cried a little (maybe due to his anger), the others mocked him for crying. after that he never ever did anything again, he was broken, he let himself go socially and in school, he hardly made his graduation later. he became addicted to drugs and lives a life as a scumbag who wasted his potentials and i realised, that i lost my archenemy and that, somehow, i owe him something since he is the reason i started to learn harder than i used to. i wrote this on my mobile, so i apologize for possible auto-correct failures. tl;dr: became better in school than my bully and it crushed him.i'm a uni student, me and six others live in this house together. when we moved in, we 'bought' a fridge off the previous tenants. apparently some group bought it six years ago or so, and each year the new tenants simply paid £50 to them to keep the fridge, since it doesn't belong to the estate agents. it's been done exactly the same for 6 years or so. our year is very nearly up (this sunday) and we showed the new tenants around a week or so ago. apparently they flat out refused to pay up for the fridge. said fridge is *very* large, and easily doubles the space for food, and with 7 people, it's pretty much necessary. it's a fair bet they (7 welsh 'lads', stereotypical dicks you met in school) are expecting to get it for free, since none of us can just take it with us. i do not intend to let them have this pleasure. why here and not pettyrevenge? i don't *want* petty revenge. i want absolute full revenge that denies them a free fridge, not to just leave it all filthy (in part because i doubt they'll care) my current plan is to simply break the plug some how. cut the power cable in half or just snap off the plug prong things. opinions? ideas? best plan gets used. only rule is it can't be overly 'visible'. like, i cant leave the fridge full of rotten food. yes it's *technically* our property, we paid for it and the estate agents told us it's none of their business at the start of the year, but still, i'm hesitant to just ram it with cheese and leave for fear that they might keep some deposit. though i *am* tempted to just drag it out onto the back road, or to a tip or something.this all happened when i was brought back to the headquarters company to replace a sergeant that was getting out. to go over everything dickbag did to deserve it would take hours. i only had to deal with him for a few months before going to my line company, and then on the tail end when i came back, so this was for everyone that never got a chance to get theirs. when staff sergeant blue-waffle first came to us from another unit he wanted to check every nsn (number used to organize the army's supply) on every item, even duplicates sitting right next to eachother. generally i could understand that, some of the durable items are expensive. but when there are three rows of 4 folding litters with the bags on each, and contents laid out exactly the same you don't need to look at every single one, mother fucker. it wasn't just durables and non-expendables though. fucking surgical gloves, tongue depressors, everything. every. single. item. when he was leaving (hallelujah) he got pissed at me because i wasn't willing to sign for any equipment until the two of us checked every single nsn on every item. when my platoon leader told me i was signing for a treatment set i went to ask ssg summer's eve what time he wanted to do it the following day. he wanted to do it then and there, because he had staff duty (24 hour shift sitting at battalion hq) that night. at about 1630 my squad got everything laid out. i called ssg. douche drippings and said i was ready for him, and told my minions to go home and have a good night. about 45 minutes (he was a 5 minute walk from where i was) later i could smell his midget ass coming. he walked up to me, handed me the 3161 (form used to track who is in possession of what items) and a pen and started staring at his phone. when i walked over to start checking item by item he said something to the effect of "what you doing coorepooral gringosuave, sign that sheeeit (just a note, he's a white dude from "the streets" in the bronx who claims to be puerto rican) i gotta get back to cq (remember, turd is staff duty nco) to relieve my runners for chow." when i told him i wasn't signing anything until i was sure everything was present, he looked like he was going to have a midget tia, snatched the 3161 out of my hand and did his best impression of a mini-me waddle. i was satisfied, i didn't mind putting it back myself. i knew that phase 1 was complete. we were going to need to start from scratch the following day, after he had been up all night. at 0900 the following day my squad and i arrived in the motor-pool. right after he got off staff duty. i called ssg massengill and told him i was in the motor pool. when he got there i started laying everything out, and i honestly thought he was going to cry. by the time we finished i think it was 1330-1400. he didn't go back to the company to grab his stuff, just headed home. when i got back after getting some food i noticed his "bjj bag" sitting on his desk, open. i took out his customized "bjjbro" (he was terrible at all things physical) shock doctor mouth guard, and put it between my balls and asshole on an especially humid day. he was gone the next day. fuck that t-rex proportioned douche bag.i fronted them their half of rent "while pay got switched over" and he asked me to wipe his computer for him (i'm a geek) because he said he wanted to donate it and scrub tax, etc info off it before. turns out, fucker was hiding in a different province, having been found guilty, awaiting sentencing. and to be clear, this wasn't accidental 16 year olds in browser caches, he "traded" thousands of images and videos of 2-4 year olds getting raped. i found out several days after he left, when my "friend" (h, who i'll mention later on) who said they would be good roommates fessed up. and seeing how his fucked up girlfriend was on disability for "epilepsy" and didn't have another income any longer, shit got really sketchy (weird "desperate and being nice, but only in order to be manipulative") because she had no possible way of making next month's rent - let alone paying me back - and that required another victim to move in to pay the rent. i moved my expensive stuff out of the house and she started acting funny, so i started video recording everything. she ended up calling the cops on me to try and get me fucked on assault charges. i went outside with my laptop with the recordings, waited for the cops and showed them the video. ended up ok, but that could have gone profoundly badly. but i wasn't on the lease (stupidly) - so the cops suggested strongly i leave, so i did. police never charged her for a false complaint, which was unfortunate. after moving, i reported them for welfare fraud (he got a cheque a few days before heading to prison, she cashed it after he was in), letters with photos to the food bank (she was collecting food for a family and scamming the system), all the social service agencies and shelters in town. sex offenders in $province go through an assessment period that determines treatment or hard time jail, so i wrote up a letter talking about how he violated the restrictions of his pre-sentencing release (along with copies of bills, lists of aliases, her talking about wanting kids with him, noted how she said she was putting "a little extra" into care packages, and how they were screwing with prison phones to get additional time, letting them know he had a gun in the home, etc), found the arresting officer, judge, crown and sent letters to them along with the city's ice and pd. i wasn't able to figure out which jail he went to (there is a bit of bumping around the system when you first go in typically) so i sent letters to the wardens of all the possibilities as well. he was hopeful that he would get the treatment program (in a place without fences), he ended up doing hard time as this got to the classification committee :) i also wrote letters to various inmates on prison penpal sites letting people know who he was but i'm pretty sure that never made it past the censors. she was evicted, had a ban on visiting (for a while presumably) and had her truck (where she was supposed to live) repoed (not my doing, just her not paying the bank). pretty sure they broke up, but she went into the shelter system and created / stole identity after identity and i wasn't able to track her. i feel kind of bad about it, but i don't think i should. should have cut off the power as well, but i didn't, because i was an idiot (and ended up paying like 2 months worth), had to pay that off recently when it showed on my credit report. he got out, years after his sentence was supposed to have been completed. tried to start a kickstarter for a cleaning company, i ensured it failed. and today i found a video of him (using a shitty alias, he took his maternal grandfather's first name and made it his last) shooting guns and being a douchebag and sent it to the same folks above. i ended up living with my "friend" (h) for 6 months until her girlfriend (m) went apeshit on me after her piece of shit son stole from me and i called the police - and decided to do an illegal eviction with one of her friends, literally breaking down a wall to get into my room when my friend refused to give her the key to my room - and tossing my shit outside as it was snowing and then calling the cops and mhes on me repeatedly saying that i was going to kill myself (in an effort to get me committed and ensure that my things would be destroyed by the weather) they also called my parents (wtf) - this was a few days after i came out to my dad as being trans, and while this didn't out me, it wasn't great either, as it's one thing to have "the talk" and the other to see my whole wardrobe on a lawn. it also reinforced his bigotry towards queer people and would later bring up this incident over and over. h and m split up within a week or two, and another friend of mine (j) showed up a week later and wondered wtf. h and j hooked up and got married a few years back, although i could never trust h again and that relationship ended. even though she did hold that key from her partner and clearly put her relationship at risk doing so, i just couldn't forgive, especially as i only found out about what she did months after it had happened. i'm broken /shrug. m fell into some really deep alcoholism and fell off the map, added me years later on facebook and tried to apologize, i never responded. didn't do anything to her, probably should have. i learned not to associate with human garbage. i spent years profoundly depressed, full of self loathing, wanting to die and attempting suicide a bunch of times. never fuck with someone who has spent decades in hell, because we're used to it, and we can drag you down and just sit there and smile while holding onto you as you desperately try to claw at the fucking walls to escape. that said, it's been a decade and continuing feels kind of... sick. certainly not rewarding, more routine. this will probably be the last time.this happened about 10 years ago, i had just started college, and i had gone to a 4 year college about 4 hours away from my hometown, where 90% of my friends still lived, most of them had another year of high school left. among this group of friends was a girl who we will call becky. becky was the biggest drama queen, gossip, and over all terrible human being. she was the "popular" girl who hung out with our group of lame arts kids so that she would ensure that 1. she was always the most cool. and 2. she made sure everyone knew that they should feel grateful she would hang out with us. i never bought into becky's crap and i could see through her, however my friends were a loyal bunch and were blinded by her, nobody would listen to me when i said "hey, shes causing drama we need to drop her". i realized i had to be sneaky... so i was in my first semester of college, and a bit homesick, i called my friends back home one friday night to find out what they were all up to (this was the early days of facebook so it wasn't open to high schoolers just yet). i called my friend, and who answered her phone? becky! when she did she told me that i was in college now, and that i should "move on" and that my friends were done with me, i had it. i trolled her on myspace, and sent her anonymous mean messages, pretended to be dudes online and got her to admit to her life secrets, gossip about our friends, then i compiled it all into one big folder. i came home for christmas break and even though i wasn't invited to her families annual christmas bash (rich people). i ended up going as a friends plus one, i walked in with a present for the white elephant, and the gift was the folder. i knew i wanted my friend lets call her tina, to be the one to get my folder, so of course i hinted all night as to how great my gift was so that tina would want it. tina was becky's "best friend" and the one that becky had talked the most shit on. sure enough my plan worked. tina opened the present, the envelope, gave me a confused look, and then really noticed what was in the folder. she passed it along to everyone, and everyone got up and walked out of the christmas party, apologized to me for not believing that she was wicked. she became a social outcast, not only did word spread about our friends but her cheerleader friends, etc all stopped speaking to her. to this day if someone new is introduced to the group i warn them that if they mess with my friends i will destroy them, they look at me in disbelief and i say, just ask becky. "whose becky?" exactly. **/r/prorevenge metrics:** total subscribers: 40,110 subreddit rank: 697 subreddit growth &amp; milestones: my uncle screwed my dad out of a good bit of money. he was also pretty much a drunk and an asshole all the time. for some reason most of the extended family took up with my uncle instead of my dad because my uncle had a high profile job and made a lot of money. so we just avoided my uncle as much as possible... many years later i am looking for a job and apply for an entry level position at a big corporation that has to do with natural gas. my best friends dad is the ceo for this company so i figured i was a shoe-in. unfortunately this is where my uncle has his high-profile job in upper management. so the ceo tells me that i wouldn't be able to work there since a close relative is in upper management. so i say in passing,"well, keep my resume on file. he is a raging alcoholic and i am sure he'll be fired eventually." two months later i get call to come in for an interview. i get the job and start work. my uncle was fired from his job and his life immediately went to shit. his wife divorced him and took him for almost everything he was worth. she also took got custody of his two sons who resent the hell out of him. he lost his giant house to the bank, after he even tried to set it on fire to claim insurance money. now he is jobless and alone. he's constantly in and out of jail due to duis and unpaid child support. now my family sees what a giant ass hat he really is... and maybe my passing statement didn't get him fired, but i like to think that i was the one who knocked the first domino over to bring his life crashing down around him. i get a mighty justice boner every time i pass him in his shitty car that is his last remaining possession. okay, this isn't my revenge. this is my dads. ///// background //// my dad works as some 'higher up' project manager for a water company. he's worked in a couple of places, all water related, from general now down to smaller companies. started in the council / big water company which hires smaller companies, which hire smaller companies to do their work etc etc. right now he's in the 2nd tier so to speak. what that basically means is, because he's worked in the 'higher tiers' he's got connections - and is desirable. friends hire people they know etc etc. he's a 'big' name. /// the set up /// in his new role, he's working on a contract his old company set; hiring another company to help fill the works load / capability gap. this is why this revenge works. they just started work with this newly hired company - started last week. the "boss" of that company / team is a man by the name of andrew (something) i'll just use smith for this story. anyway, andrew smith needs to suck up to my dad because the success of his company relies on getting more jobs. andrew smith's workers aren't that many. they've all been put forward to my dad, name's, pictures and all. they also have company utes (pickups), with their company name on the side. /// the scenario /// my dad was driving, on a saturday, with my mum and cousins (one cousin is about 8-10 years old) to the markets. there's a three lane road, which merges to a two. my dad is driving in the middle lane, where the left lane merges in. well up comes this ute driving in excess of the speed limit by a large margin (as my dad tells it), undertaking my dad (illegal and dangerous) and cutting him up as the lane ends. well my dad is none too pleased. opening his window giving the ute driver a piece of his mind, how dangerous what he's done is how stupid it was etc etc. well mr. ute is not in the wrong - so he thinks - giving out the insults of his own, how he can do what he wants, and where my dad can shove it etc. well here it gets interesting. my dad recognizes the driver. now, he's atleast an hours drive from work (my dad drives an hour every day to work) and the work site - near his house, and this construction worker is also atleast an hours drive away from where they would normally meet. what are the odds right? well anyway, my dad recognizes the company name too, he's got to be the guy. so my dad starts shouting, "do you know andrew smith! do you know andrew smith!" over and over again. this guy seems completely oblivious to what my dad is saying while he tries to override it with his own insults. they drive on and part ways. (it seems like the ute is also going to the markets but changes his mind). /// the start of mr. utes end // before they walk from the car to the markets my dad has called andrew smith, on a saturday, left a message explaining the situation, "if this is how dangerous he acts on the road, i can't expect him to act safely on my worksite" etc etc, with the end: "if you don't call me back, don't bother coming to work on monday." boom. that's a huge source of revenue lost for a company because of one guy cutting up a random on the road, and words can spread in a close industry. very quickly. well, not 30 minutes later, my dad has an email from andrew smith, 'health and safety very important to us yadda yadda yadda, we take this very seriously, yadda yaddda yadda, will definitely look into it.' i wish i could have been there when mr. ute got the call. "did you cut up someone just now, in a company ute?" "no..." "well my boss, the project manager for our new contract, said you just cut him up." "well, i might've got into an arguement with some guy but-" "oh for fucks sake" etc etc the chewing out would've been glorious. /// the aftermath /// monday morning andrew smith is in my dads office, apologizing on his knees. mr. ute is not going to be seen this week, got to keep his head down for a while, he's a good worker but he needs to learn the effect of his actions etc etc handed a reprimand does it again he's out etc etc. well he's on my dad's radar now as someone to make life hell for. before midday my dad has a personal email from mr ute apologizing profusely for what he did, how he was going to drop his wife off to her broken down car (or some equal cop out) how he's very sorry, and how it doesn't reflect on his work ethic. all this grovelling goodness. after telling the story at the dinner table my dad said, "well you've gotta take the victories don't you." //// tl;dr: guy cuts up dad. guys boss just started working for dad. dad recognized guy. calls guys boss - on a saturday - threatens to drop business. guy's walking into work on monday with a puckered arsehole, a significant hit to the pride and a serious wrist slap that you wouldn't want following you around.i used to have a friend who was a bit of a klepto. he bought a shotgun, sold it to a friend, stole it back, and sold it to another friend. he broke into people's houses, shoplifted, and lifted stuff at parties. we met in high school, became friends, and even though i knew him, i trusted him. he was two timing these two girls. one of them had a new roomie, named bruiser (names have been altered to protect the guilty.) one day, bruiser's duffel bag disappears. bruiser was relatively new to town. he had some kids he'd lost when he split with his ex. in his duffel bag he had all of his pictures of his children, all of his money, his clothes, and his gun. he was enraged and hurt at the theft. bruiser and his friends suspected everyone. he did everything he could think of to have his property returned. he accused and threatened his room mate, hope. chased kids out of parties. it was a huge deal for him. hope moved back east. some innocent kids lost all of their friends. bruiser never caught on that my friend, mason had stolen his bag. mason didn't get along with his father, a convicted rapist who was married to a mcdonald's manager. he was getting kicked out all of the time. one weekend, my parents were out of town. they told me not to have anyone over, and i invited mason. in the months that followed that weekend, it became clear that things were missing from my house. my headphones were gone, as well as my dad's cellphone, etc. it took longer than it should have for me to put 2 and 2 together. while my parents suspected that i had stolen from them; i started to realize the extent of the missing items, their size... hmmm. mason was kicked out again, and found refuge at a friend's house; the brothers, mick and dick. we had all been close friends for a long time, but they jumped immediately to the correct conclusion when their rent money vanished. mason was kicked out. they were pissed. he was denying it, i didn't believe it could be him. we still hung out, but tensions ran high. one night, following this recent theft, a party was happening, and we were all going to go. we were all at mick and dick's house (mason too) waiting for them to finally break free of crowd inertia and begin to move in the direction of this party. we had too many people for one car, so i brought mason on my bike. he requested we stop by the parking lot where his car was parked, so he could change. in the parking lot, mick gets into an argument with one of the passengers of his car. it was taking a while, so i drove off for the party with mason, after he changed. that night, mason's car was broken into. everything he owned was taken from that car. he blamed mick and dick. they denied it. a few months later, one of my friends confessed to me that they had stolen mason's stuff. the realized they had made the right call when they found some of their missing things in with his possessions. that is when i realized that mason had no boundaries. he had done the same thing to my family. friendships ended over these events, and mason disappeared from our lives. mick and dick did not find their rent money. but they had no doubt who had taken it. they had their revenge. i had not had mine. after much thought, i decided what to do. bruiser had been in town for years now. he had developed into a fine, upstanding thug, whom virtually nobody in their right mind would cross. he was in a gang. not the high school type. he had job-stopper ink all over, and was well known. one day, i ran into bruiser. i had called hope, back east, and let her know that mason had stolen bruiser's bag. she was grateful for the closure, but forgave him. bruiser was grateful for the closure as well, remorseful for innocents he'd hurt, and curious what mason's last name was. i was as helpful as i could be. little by little, the stories started to come to me. they had chased him out of a couple eateries he worked at. he lost those jobs because he was too scared to return. i don't know what all happened to mason. but i do know, payback's a bitch.im a pacifist; i have never truly been in a fight, and i tend to deal with most situations by compromising and talking to the other party. rarely do i get personal or take things personally. but, there was one kid. this one fucking kid, who i actually let a grudge fester against. nevermind the fact that he pissed all over my collection of magic cards while we were drinking, or the granola-head demeanor he always had about him despite the fact he was also one of the most bigoted people i know, who just happened to always wear bob marley gear and tye-dye clothing while preaching peace and love but being a rich scumbag. nevermind the fact that he tried hooking up with my ex the day he heard we broke up. all my hatred for this dude culminated into a vengeance plot over a simple facebook conversation. the whole background is much too tedious to explain in full. his status made an obscure joke, someone said they didn't get it, and i replied to that dude using what i thought was a funny context to draw the joke in. granola head went off on me for this, but really in the end what inspired my hatred to reach its zenith was when he called me a retard, a word i'm very sensitive with as a person who has lived his life with a developmental disorder and worked very hard to become a functioning human being (its only the word "retard" when used in the context to belittle a person that i get upset sometimes). at the time, i was pursuing an education in chemistry (which i later dropped in lieu of other interests). so, i had access to acids and other basic chemicals. now if you do a lot of drugs you might have heard of certain reagents you can use to test for mdma like the marquis reagent. reagents like these don't just turn a single color in the presence of a single compound. i made some marquis myself using a 1:20 ratio of 30% formaldehyde and concentrated sulfuric acid. i made about 8 liters of it and in the middle of the night, i traveled up the dirt road to his house, parking at the bottom, and dumped it all over his car, not knowing if it would even do anything at all. i don't know whats in those paints and waxes, but whatever it was got fucked up. he worked at a local pizza shop downtown and behind it was his car. his car went from a dark, metallic black to a bright orange/pink.alright, so i was in 8th grade when this happened, and everyone in 8th grade gets a locker. this being middle school, everyone was an immature douchebag. there was one prevalent pair of kids in particular who picked on people, including me. i was the smart kid during this time, making me a prime target for the dubious duo. i'll call them e and w. e was shorter than me, maybe 5'0", and w was about 5'10". e thought he was the coolest guy in school, and claims to do oh-so-many drugs as a way to improve his "street cred." w is a big guy, but is basically a follower. he can't really exist independently from other people and is essentially around to hit stuff. e and w used to be my friends, in fact, during the beginning of the school year, but they turned out pretty bad. what they did to me was called the locker slam. every day after school got out, all the classes rush like a herd of bison towards the lockers to grab their stuff and gtfo as soon as possible. on most days the callous couple would come up to me while i was staring at the wall and my locker and slam it closed, forcing me to manually re-enter the combination. this was annoying and tiring for me, but i put up with it almost half the year before i snapped. i am not a violent man. i don't like hurting people. however, on this particular occasion i completely lost all my inhibitions regarding violence, as they decide to step up their bullying scheme and take it up a level. here's what went down: i'm getting my books out of my locker and have my head partially inside when the bullying bunch come up onto me. i don't hear them, as the locker door shields me from most sounds not behind or to the left of me. e shoves me forward and steps back, allowing w to slam the locker shut on my exposed head. (by this point, the hallway has mostly cleared and there are no teachers present to witness this. there are a couple kids, however.) the door smashes into me with the force of an 8th-grade giant's arms, and i fall inwards. they burst out laughing. i lie in there for about 20 seconds and then come back to my senses, such as they were. i stand up, spitting out blood (having bit my cheek), and look e square in the eye. he goes white. i punch him in the balls and he doubles over; i'll deal with him later. i turn to w. he already has his massive fist drawn back and is ready to show me twelve colors of pain. i dodge the stupidly predictable punch, duck down, com up again after he withdraws his fist, and kick him in the stomach. he gasps, some of his breath driven out, and i take the opportunity to bring him down with my body weight. he lands on his back, and i give him the good ol' curb-stomp into the stomach again and kick his nuts for good measure. w curls up, and i eye e again as he's still doubled over. "stop *right now* or i will destroy your balls." he shakily nods. i walk out the door and go home, feeling like i had just triumphed over the gods... and then the adrenaline wore off and i realized what i had just done to them. i instantly felt terrible. i didn't apologize to e or w. i also didn't want to and so lose face and the protection i had just gained by beating the pulp out of them. by the end of the year, we reached a sort of mutual agreement to forget it all, and the next year we were great friends. it worked out great for us, because neither of us could go snitch with a teacher without getting in trouble ourselves. tl;dr: the pungent pest and his bulking bruiser are decidedly decimated by an audacious assailant.this happened a few years ago on my first trip to british colombia. my brother and i rented a mustang for our trip up to see whistler in the mountains. if any of you remember the sea to sky highway when it was basically a mountain highway with two lanes winding around up and down..very slow if you have an rv in front of you lugging up the mountain..just waiting for a passing lane to open up. i was 25 years old in a mustang with my brother on vacation. we're having a blast leading a group of maybe a dozen cars with the top down. i'm leading at about 10-15 km/h over the limit being mindful of the roads; all the cars are leaving gaps and we're peaceful. my brother first alerted me to this a-hole suv driver pulling insane blind passes and hearing other drivers honk. he's cutting people off in corners to squeeze back into formation to avoid accidents. i'm feeling the frustration of other drivers. we're all moving along peacefully with space when someone has to come along and ruin it. i notice now he's about three cars behind me when i hatch the plan. i decide once he's behind me he'll stay there as i'll just gas up right after each apex to toy with him a bit and i eventually did. a passing lane in 3km..at this point i haven't seen any police on the roads and thought i'll have a little fun for the other drivers amusement (and of course my own). each time he would nudge out to pass i'd just gas up and give myself 2-3 bus lengths..he'll catch up..next corner do it all over again. he's throwing up his arms..giving me the finger..riding my bummer..passing lane in 1km..i created a noticeable gap going into the passing lane. get over to the right lane doing 40 km/h over the limit with cruise control on. at about the 100m mark left of the passing lane converging over i see him flying up easily twice the limit and i was going to just slow down and allow him to pass me..i'm checking my blind spot thinking why hasn't he passed me yet when i notice a police officer on the other side of the road crossed the highway to point him off!!! a-hole got a massive speeding ticket i surmise!! i was high on life after that. two other drivers that probably fell victim to his stupidity gave me a thumbs up once we were in whistler. tl;dr: fuck with other drivers on the road in a dangerous manner..someone will fuck with you. a-hole gets the attention of police. i get two thumbs up from other drivers who witnessed what went down.i'll start by saying i've been considering this for some time. in my personal opinion, if i'm going to read a text-based post, i don't want to have to open another window or be dragged away from my current one. a lot of the stories posted here have been links to r/pettyrevenge and what i'm proposing would just be that if you're going to link to a text-based post on another subreddit where there is no need to to link, to just copy and paste the story rather than making the reader have to load a new page. links would be fine if it was to a news story, picture, comment thread, etc., this would only make it so that text posts that have no need to be linked would stay here rather than redirecting the reader. i'd like to know what you guys think so please comment on this or message me directly. i'll make a decision after hearing what you all have to say.i'll start off by saying it isn't exactly revenge against my ex, but it involves her. a couple years ago, i was dating this girl that i loved. we had been together for about two years, despite multiple incidents in which i found out she cheated. i know i'm an idiot for staying with her, but whatever. we broke up eventually, and i was devastated inside. about 2-3 days after the break-up, my dad and i get into a huge fight. long story short, i get headbutted and end up moving out the next day. as i'm living away from my parents, i get texts from my ex's new boyfriend saying that if i kept talking to her he was going to beat my ass, blah blah blah. keep in mind, we broke up because i found out she blew me off to hang out with the guy she was currently with. so back to the story, i tell him that if that was how he felt than he knew where i lived and he could come by to settle it. his reply to that: "well you're ugly." that's what you say when you're called out?! a few months pass, and i'm back living with my parents. my ex texts me one day, and wants to come hang out. she's still dating this guy, so i agree. she comes over, and one things lead to another and we end up bumping uglies. but before we start, she suggests we record it on her phone. i'll never know to this day whether he ever found the video or not, but the satisfaction i felt inside was wonderful. tl;dr - you call me ugly, i fuck your girlfriend. and record it.we all love prorevenge and reading your great stories but as the sub has grown to over 20,000, the number of posts hasn't significantly grown. as an attempt to add more content to the sub, starting today we will be allowing links to be posted for the next two weeks. this is only a trial and we won't make a final decision until the trial period is over. while we realize quality is often better than quantity, we also think there are some really good stories out there from other sources. some people have pasted stories here and while that's fine, it's also a hassle and we feel there are a number of reasons allowing links could be beneficial. for the trial period all posts will be allowed - pictures, news stories, blogs, etc. but if we do decide to allow links when this is over, we may limit what is allowed. we care about your feedback so please comment in this post or message the mods your feelings on this new trial. we want what's best for the users so we care about what you all want. just as a friendly reminder, please still follow the rules and be polite to each other. also, please never post personal information and never ask for information. thank you.this is something i did in 9th grade. i had a friend scott, who was one grade older than me. we were friends through most of elementary and jr high, but when we got to high school and i was a freshman and he was a sophomore, he decided to start picking on me. we had a math class together that required us to keep a folder for extra credit. we could choose one homework assignment and one quiz every week to put in the folder, the teacher then based how much extra credit we got by the grades of the assignments you put in the folder. one day about week before grades were due i pretended i was putting assignments in my folder, but really i took scott's folder, and emptied it. the next week our teacher asked scott why his folder was empty. scott couldn't figure it out, and spent all class looking for the missing assignments. i started to feel bad, cuz he looked like he wanted to cry. he had already failed the class last year, and really needed the extra credit to pass this year. i was torn between feeling bad and trying not to laugh and give myself away. eventually our teacher told him to stop looking and learn to be responsible. he had to work his ass off the rest of the semester to pass. i wonder what became of him........he wanted to be a cop...please don't kill me but i was wondering what and why the division is between /r/pettyrevenge and /r/prorevenge . is there some awesome backstory i'm missing out on?during my freshman year of middle school, i got the nickname loki, after the god of tricks in norse mythology, and exactly how i got the name i will explain now. at the beginning of the year, i was a loner, no friends, absolutely no social life, i got bullied a fair amount, but then there was this kid...who we shall call george, who was the definition of a jock, no intelligence, good at sports, needs "nerds" to do homework for him because he couldn't comprehend math. he started to pick on me, and throughout 2 months, it turned to bullying. this continued for another 3 months, when i have had enough. i go home one day, furious, and decide that i'm going to take this bastard down. i realized i wasn't strong enough to fight directly, but, if i could pull it off, i could fight him indirectly. so for 2 days (it was the weekend) i began to plan. i cut holes into my jacket to act as compartments, (don't really remember what i built, though) by the end, i had created the perfect trickster suit. so on monday, i put on my jacket and leave for the bus, and sure enough, the bastard awaits me. he goes into grab me, but i was prepared, i quickly brought my pinky to my palm, which released a set of marbles on the floor, and then i slowly walked back. the bastard slips and falls, but gets up quickly and charges for me. so i quickly start running, and i feel something on my right arm, a toy spider, smiling, i turn around and throw it at him, he freaks out and begins to run, and then slips on the marbles and smashes his head against the sidewalk, he lived. (okay, maybe the perfect suit was a lie, it was mostly filled with stuff like marbles, toy bugs, some glue and a water gun, but to 12 year old me, it was f*cking perfect.) **tldr**: i brought down bully using marbles and a toy spider.if you need to link to a news story, picture, etc., that is fine, this is only so that the reader doesn't get ripped away from their current page because the op

in a small town in north carolina. i was in the fourth grade, just as happy as can be. i was a generally quiet kid and got along well with pretty much everyone. i was the quintessential "good" kid that everyone loved. one day, while playing soccer at recess, one of the kids shoved me down, kicked me in my stomach, *then* kicked the ball. now, this kid was barely a stranger to me. i don't remember ever talking with him, let alone having any issues with him, nor him, me. i think, in my clouded memory of long-past, he may have been in a different grade... so when he did this, besides being physically hurt, i was confused as to why someone would to such a thing to me on purpose. after a visit to the nurses office and going back home, nothing came of this situation for a couple weeks. well, one day i was sitting outside with my girlfriend (aww... young love), waiting for my oldest sister to pick me up. i don't remember why we weren't riding home on the buses this day, but it doesn't really matter... as me and my girlfriend (you always remember your first love, right?!) were just sitting there talking, that same kid from before approaches us and starts calling us names, and at one point, called my girlfriend a whore. now, i was a pretty sheltered kid at this time, and some of those names were foreign to me, but my sense of honor demanded that i stand up for my girlfriend (i never cared if someone called me names, even at that age). so, i started off running after the little scamp. well, he was quite a bit faster and more nimble than i was, and so easily evaded all my attempts to... do whatever my young mind was going to do to him. after a while, he eventually got tired of running around me and waited for me.. only to kick me as hard as he could in my groin. again, back to the nurses office, with a phone call to my parents about what had happened, etc, etc, but to my knowledge, nothing happened to that kid. closer to the end of the year, we were out playing soccer again, and i saw that same kid. well, this time, i wasn't going to just let him be. i waited until he had the ball, and then instead of kicking it to get it away from him, kicked him in the knee. hard. somehow, and to the best of my knowledge, my girlfriend was the only one who saw it. i never got in trouble, and i never saw him again, either. i like to think that i might have broken his knee/leg.my brother has been unfaithful for eight out of 20 years of his marriage, possibly more. he has also been reckless with his debts, raking in nearly $300,000 which our parents had to pay to bail him out. he only had one son, who was epileptic and disabled all his life and died a couple years ago in his teens. after the latest and hopefully the last bailout in october last year, we discovered his incessant infidelity which led to his wife leaving his house to crash at my other brother's place until she could figure out how to be independent again. the police was also brought into the picture by getting him and the mistress to appear in front of someone of authority to deter them to stop engaging in this adultery. yeah, that's something we do in our country. when the homewrecker finally made the appearance, she proudly roared, "are you threatening me?" to us as if nothing was morally dubious about their relationship whatsoever. later, mr. moneyman here apologized and swore he would be a totally different man and begged for the wife to come back. she refused. meanwhile he lost his job (dad's business, fired him) and thus was unable to afford the house (dad's business' allowance). he moved in with our parents and i was tasked to *help him*. i foolishly took pity thinking that he misses his wife and would do everything to get her back. i couldn't have been more wrong. he continued to deceive us that he had cut all contact with the mistress when in fact, he was still adamant on paying her grocery, phone, and scores of other expenses. i then set up a nice fat keylogger on the pc he was using, promptly took over his and her facebook and gmail accounts. spammed her naked pictures to 27 of her favorites friends along with extended proof of their thousands of dollars™ worth escapades while my sister-in-law was taking care of his disabled child at home 24/7. i then took over her icloud account and proceeded to brick the iphone 6 plus my brother had so affectionately gifted her. she did manage to recover her email address but i had completely disassociated her facebook and icloud accounts from it. facebook was then deleted. they are still together. hey prorevengers, i just wanted to say how excited we are to have over a thousand readers! we've been a community for about a month and already created a network with /r/escalatingrevenge and /r/myevilplan (see sidebar for multireddit). we are also happy to already have a number of great posts already! we hope to get even more readers soon and become even bigger as well as get even more great stories! thanks to everyone here for subscribing and sharing our sub around reddit!my friend knew this girl in high school. he was mad about her. after graduating, life sent them on separate paths. love and regret: after about 20 years they got in touch again after meeting at the high school reunion. memories were rikindled. sparks flew again: one and many things lead to another, and he moves across states to be with her. he moves in and they are happy! after a couple of months he notices that she would have these massive mood swings from happy to anger, to bitchiness, to cruelty. a completely different person. he notices that her ex-husband would come around a lot. "we're just friends." was her explanation. one day he spots her computer email open and reads emails between the ex and her about having sex when my buddy wasn't around. she would say "he just left. c'mon on over. lets fuck." and "he's just here to pay the rent." and "he's and idiot." he reads her replies and correspondence to guys all over the country on craig's list cruising for sex. he prints out all the emails and mails them to the fiancee of the ex-husband. she received them on dec. 24th . by then, my buddy has moved out. on the 24th his ex calls many times, but he dioesn't answer. she did finally send one more text saying "you just ruined christmas!" a year later he meets a beautiful girl that he had known before and they got married and are very, very happy. my dad told me this story about a guy he used to work with. my dad's coworker grew up in a rural area. he lived next to this old white trash douchenozzle who was a huge alcoholic. one day the family dog was found shot to death in their back yard bordering the prick's property. they had had issues with the guy before this but nothing close to this bad. they confronted him about it and he pretty much told them all to go to hell. well, this guy and his brothers had had enough of this bullshit and decided to get back at him. they knew the guy went into town to get drunk every weekend and came back late to pass out. they waited until he got back one saturday night from the bar in the summer and snuck over to his truck. they got into the truck and popped the hood. they laid some roadkill, a rotten possum carcass, on the hot engine block and closed the hood. that possum sat in there through the whole hot summer day decomposing until the guy had to go into town and noticed the stench. he probably never got the smell out. back story: many years a worked in a care facility and had the opportunity to do the ait (administrator in training) program with the small company. it was a year long paid program where i kept my regular accounting job with them at the same time. at the end of the program i thought i would be given a facility of my own with them, but one of the head cheeses (big cheese senior vp) of the company didn't like me. i found out it was because the lady i was working under had tried to become an administrator and had failed the national exam 3 times and complained to big cheese about me many times (for bogus stuff). i was fired a month after i received my administraor's license and big cheese that didn't like me said: hemingway1957 will never be an administrator for us!shortly afterwards i was offered a great job with another company at a really good salary. i also got a 2 month severance package because i wrote a letter to the company president and told him that as a licensed administrator in that small state i would like to be able to say positive things about his small company (they had about 8 nursing homes). i worked for the new company for about 4 years running a well-regarded facility. we had great outcomes, great reviews and made good money. i had a good friend that continued to work for the other company and he would occasionally mention in meetings with the head cheeses how well i was doing. my revenge: i was lured away to another state by another company with a large salary offer, but it was a crap company and i put the word out with recruiters and others that i was looking. lo and behold i get called by the president of my old company that they would like to interview me for an administror's position at their premier rehab facility. so i agreed to the interview and had them fly me almost 1000 miles, rent me a car (i picked a new mustang), put me up in a nice hotel for 2 nights for the interview. i take advantage of that by visiting relatives, putting tons of miles on the rental, going skiing (great resorts in that area) and had a great time. did the interview and they offer me the job. i tell them i would think about it. i went home and accepted another offer that i knew was coming (one that i was going to take anyway) and didn't bother to call them back with my decision. about 2 weeks later i get a call from the president (the one that gave me the severance) asking about when i wanted to start work. i said: "well, you know, i would love to, but several years ago big cheese said that i would never be an administrator for your compnay and i guess he was right." and i hung up. it was sweet. that company has since broken up.this happened around 2001 when i worked for a computer company that decided to start offering web hosting. since the project was one of the top initiatives of our ceo, he took a very keen interest in how his pet project was going and was very responsive when anyone emailed him about any and all difficulties. while that's usually a good thing to do for customer service, it's often not so great for the poor sales guy that gets that one customer that has issues with everything. so on to the story.. i was working in my cube farm when i got a call from a cheery young lady looking to propel her boss' company into the information age and was looking to see what we could do to help her out. m - me. cg - cheerful girl (for now) m: "hi this is joetheok, how can i help you?" cg: "i need web hosting for my company's website and i'm not sure where to begin" m: "you've come to the right place, let's see what we can do to help" so that's probably not the exact wording but i do always try to be helpful to my customers so that's the general gist of the start of the conversation. we went on to talk about our facility, how things work, the pricing and a lot of other q&amp;a. in all, it took about 30-45 minutes to get everything sorted out and make her a happy camper when we ended the call (this is called foreshadowing). she said she needed to make a couple more calls and then give everything to her boss but i should hear from her in a day or so. fast forward a couple of days and i hadn't heard from her so i figured i'd give her a call and find out if she was ready to go. i actually got her on the first call (rare for sales) and at that point, we'll just call her pg for pissy girl because nothing that came out of her mouth during this conversation was nearly as pleasant as our initial call. at first, i thought i'd actually gotten her evil twin but then came to the conclusion that this was in fact the same person, just on a different frequency. apparently, after calling us, she called a competitor who proceeded to tell her all sorts of fictitious information which she spewed upon me. pg: "i spoke to your competitor and he told me a ton of lies (i don't remember what all she said but i think he got our name right. other than that, it was pretty much all false)" m: &lt;tries to debunk said lies&gt; pg: "he said you'd try to say that but i know better (i guess his lies were prettier than my truth? no idea, i have a very pleasant phone voice, i guess his was just better) m: "i'm sorry you feel that way, but i'd be happy to go over everything and make sure you have a clear picture of what you're getting from both companies and clear up any misunderstandings if i can" pg: &lt;nothing vulgar was said but nothing complimentary at this point either. i believe she did cast some aspersions upon my truthfulness and perhaps my parentage. at this point, we were pretty much done&gt; m: "if there's anything we can do for you, please let me know" pg: &lt;click&gt; about 10 minutes later i get an email in my box from the harridan that i had been copied on. i also realized that it was directed to my ceo who i was certain was going to read it. it contained a litany of my sins, my shortfalls, my lack of ability to tell the truth, and quite possibly my severe lack of hygiene (none of which was true, especially the stinky part). i didn't realize how fast our ceo would read that but by the time i was through reading this sternly worded missive, my manager was popping out of his cubbyhole like he been shot from a gun. he got an email, my director got one and both of them wanted to know what the hell i was doing. fortunately, i had a great rep on the floor and a couple of awards for being a customer advocate so i wasn't hoisted up on a stake to serve as an example for the rest of the staff. it did, however, take a bit of telling the tale and swearing on an unopened copy of microsoft windows to convince them that i wasn't even half as horrible as i was portrayed in this work of fiction. now the revenge part. upon arriving to work that morning, i got a lovely piece of spam in my mailbox. all i had to do to get all of the loveliest, filthiest, hardcore porn delivered to me daily was just give them my email address. since this was before the canned spam act, there wasn't any of that pesky validation thing so with just a couple of clicks of a mouse, i made sure she was fully informed on every variation of every sexual position and fetish anyone could send her (for free even, what a bargain). not only had she emailed me from her corporate address, she even copied her home email so she could keep a copy of the dressing down she gave me presumably so she could cheer herself up by reading it when she couldn't find anybody in the office to have fired. not wanting her to miss out on her education into the ways of the world if she wasn't at work, i added that address too. i'm not exactly what transpired at that point but knowing the wild west of porn spam at that time, i always rest assured that her email boxes were defiled and defiled and then defiled some more because once they had an address, even an act of god wouldn't get you off of it. throwaway for obvious reasons. so we had this kid lets call him fuckhead, cause he is, staying in our home for 2-3 months rent free. my roommate who owns the house has a really big heart and i also think likes drama, and so has these boys stay over to get back up on their feet. well most of them fuck off and don't get jobs or even try, sometimes are rude, take food that isn't theirs, etc. but i digress my roommate has a big heart so he kinda lets people walk on him. so fuckhead we were pretty sure was stealing prescription pills from my roommates mother, she is like a walking corpse and needs her medication. so it had gotten to the point where we were tired of giving him chances and kicked him out. last i had seen of him i was told he shouldn't be around, i threatened to get my gun because i assumed he was trespassing. well last weekend for some reason my roommate let fuckhead stay the night because i guess he had no where to go, on the terms that he left early. well he was hanging out longer than needed, but eventually left. then i find out one of my roommates other couch kids caught fuckhead in roomies room straight up taking change and money out of his jar, and acted like he didn't even do it. then tuesday night about 30 mins after my bf goes to work i hear the fence next to my room banging around. i assumed it was a dog trying to get out, we had one that would escape all the time. so i open my curtain and there is fuckhead looking straight at me, breaking into our yard to steal stuff. i wasn't thinking, i just wanted to get him, and so ran in the the house to the backyard but i think he hopped back over the fence and ran off. i yelled to my roomie in the shed out back (its like the trailer park boys, 11 ppl live here, we have ppl everywhere) if she had a friend upstairs cause sometimes they'll hop the fence to visit her. i told her fuckhead was in our yard and to grab her bat. i go downstairs and inform the other couch kid to grab his bat and we search the block for him yelling that if we see his face we're gonna smash it. so we lock everything up for the night and are on our toes if he tries to come back. now wednesday night i go to work, come home hang out pass out. wake up the next day and my roomies are tellin me he was back last night and was in stuff. one of our friends unaware of the situation had let him spent the night, but had issues getting him to leave the next morning, so my roomies went over with bats to get him out of the house. then they noticed that he had stolen objects on him, like headphones he had to bust into one of our cars for, a cd he had to of gone through my shed roomies stuff for, etc. once i hear this i think oh no. i had just got out of the shower and had to be to work at 4. i run into my bus and check my drawer where i keep my savings. $100 gone. i fell to the ground and started bawling, i was so angry. i knew i should have locked my stuff up better after seeing him trying to break into our stuff. i run inside and tell everyone what he did. but the guy is a dumbass. they found an ad he posted on cl, he even took a picture, it was taken in the house of the friend they went and kicked him out of. he's looking for a girl. so my roommate messages him and talks to him pretending to be a girl and to meet him/her in the park. i had to go to work, upset, that was all of my money. well like i said we have 11 ppl in our house. 5 or 6 of them went and they all stood at the exits in groups of two. the girls even walked up right behind him and waited while he sat on the bench waiting for the girl that was never going to come. my bf is a scary looking guy, tattoos and piercings on his face, strong, big, ex-military, has guns, knows how to use them, etc. he was a fucking retard to even go into our bus and steal from us. so he's sitting there i guess and then he sees my bf coming at him from across the park, so he goes to get up and run, but the girls are behind him. they both just push him down and start punching him. one of my newer roomates comes over now and picks him up and knocks him down again with a punch. then picks him up. at this point my bf is running at him and just takes a flying punch at his face knocking him on the ground again. at this point he is on the ground crying like a bitch while getting boots in his face. finally my roomie who owns the house gets there and is kneeling on top of him screaming into his face how fucking stupid he is for stealing from us when we let him into our home. the whole time while my bf is grabbing his head and shaking him and yelling at him for fucking with his gf. then one of the girls says he has a knife in his pocket. my bf grabs it and throws it away to disarm him. we did everything legal, no weapons. only a misdemeanor could be givin for kicking the shit out of him, but what is he gonna say "oh i got the shit kicked out of me because i was stealing from these people multiple times" then my bf notices that is his knife, that was in the same drawer as my money. also keep in mind this kid is trying to say he didn't take anything from us, when we have caught him red handed, and he also had the stuff on him. at this point people thought it was over for him, they thought my bf was going to kill him, but my bf didn't even pull the knife on him, but i'm sure the kid almost pissed his pants thinking he was about to die. they emptied his pockets and while they are taking stuff he has the nerve to be like "hey thats mine!" he only had $25 in his wallet and my bfs like "mine now!" at first we took his nice phone and bus pass, but my bf said to show a little compassion and gave it back. we told him to get the fuck out of town or we won't hold back next time. my bf wanted to cut his clothes off and make him walk around naked, but that would be illegal. he got boots to the face...he cried like a bitch. i don't think he will ever mess with us again. i only got $10 of my money, and he bought some fucking spice (fake weed) and salvia with my money. i recognized the price tags they were from a porn store across the street from the house. i took the salvia i smoke it sometimes. but yea...fuck that guywell, looking at all the bullies stories over reddit the past few days reminded me of some stuff i did myself in 5th grade or so around that time, i was somewhat underweight and the 1st one in my class to get specs. my parents made me wear that sting for the extra geeky look as well :( now, some people did not like me for wearing them. they really did not like me for wearing them it was usually verbal, but 2 guys got physical when i kept ignoring their verbal taunts (why do schools recommend ignorance instead of revenge, god knows!) anyways, they had been randomly pushing me around, pulling my chair away,etc for a few days well, it was time to get even. even though i did not look too strong, i had enough to muster up a few strong punches and shoves. but i couldnt take on 2 of them. so, i needed to get them down 1 by 1. dealt with one by skipping a pe period, stealing some stuff from the teachers desk and a few of the students the teacher loved and stuffing it into this guys bag. well,when class started a search happened and that got rid of this guy for a few days didnt have a plan for the 2nd one, but i had some sort of an exhibition coming up soon. where the school principal would have been present. provoked this guy about 5 -10 min beore she turned up, kept him off me (barely), him him hard once to get him pissed and as soon as he started retaliating i got all limp as if i had been beaten badly. thats when she walked in as well. the consequences of that were fun to watch, it kicked off a series of events that led to the guy being held back a year in 5th grade back in the early 90's, i went on a camping trip with a bunch of friends, and a younger friend of a friend had invited his high school buddies who were a bunch of belligerent jocks. that night, around the campfire, the jocks are exceedingly drunk and fighting each other occasionally and making a hell of a mess. the next morning my friends and i were up earlier than them and collected all the trash into bags. when they woke up, we asked them if they'd be willing to take just one bag with them to dispose of it (most of it was cans from their pisswater they'd brought). they laughed and said they didn't give a fuck and they weren't taking any trash. while they were distracted, we put all the bags of trash in their trunk, as the little bit of camping stuff they has was still in their back seat. perhaps not the most satisfying revenge, but they probably had quite a stench in the car after a week or so. my history teacher told me this story a week or two ago. i don't know if this is true, or what the final outcome was, but we can all hope. so, as we all know, driving drunk is very dangerous for the driver and anyone around them. the driver of one car was drunk, probably over the speed limit by an absurd amount, etc. as is essentially cliche at this point, she hit another person, surviving while the sober driver died soon after. she was caught and arrested (i don't know the legal system, et cetera, so i may be wrong with some of the stuff in this paragraph). when she was brought to court, she settled out by being required to keep a picture of the guy she killed in her wallet, to be checked by her probation officer every meeting. the picture the mother of the dead guy chose a picture that would force the woman to remember what she has done for the rest of her life: a picture of the guy in his coffin. **tl;dr: drunk driver kills someone and must carry the picture of him in his coffin for the rest of their life.** to anyone who think this isn't a kind of pro revenge: think of how it would affect you mentally to be reminded daily that it's your fault that someone's son and possible father and/or husband was killed when it was avoidable.[have a liiiiink](

remember that gift certificate you kept promising me you send me? exactly why should i help you now?" his response was to defriend me on facebook. how christ-like of him. :-) this happened a couple of years ago. in the area i live in it's not uncommon to see amercan flags in front of businesses, especially car dealerships. it's also common here to see the amercian flag hung alongside mexican flags and i've even seen it buried in a whole array of flags from south america. while it's great for a car dealership to display their pride in multiculturalism i feel displaying our flag this way degrades it's importance. so on my way to work one day i was delighted to see a car dealership that had american flags clipped to every car and hanging on the fence in front were two larger flags and not a foreign flag to be seen. it was a mom and pop place with a dirt parking lot with a trailer office in the back and about 10 or 15 used cars on the lot. i'll call the owner dealership guy (dg). my excitement was misplaced because as over the next few weeks i would drive by and sometimes either one or both of the larger flags had come off of the poles and were lying on the ground or had been pushed down on the poles so that they were flying half mast or at the bottom of the poles but they were usually fixed rather quickly so i just blew it off. one morning i was driving by with my wife and as usual, my eyes went to the flags and i shouted, "**why is that flag hanging upside down?!!!**". my wife told me to calm down and either email or call them when i get to work and ask them to fix it. when i got to work i found the dealership's website and an email address to which i sent the following email: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ *from: redacted_voice* *to: dealership_guy* *sent: thursday, july 30, 2009 11:28 am* *subject: flag* *what is the problem with the american flags in front of your business?* *everytime i've passed by your office this week the flags are either on the ground or* *hanging upside down. as a veteran who has made sacrifices for his country i find this * *lack of respect for a symbol of those sacrifices made by me and many others offensive. this* *lack of attention to detail reflects on you and your business and i will never buy from* *someone who cannot pay attetion to something as simple as proper respect for our* *national flag and will even go to great lengths to ensure that my friends and aquaintences* *do not shop there either.* *thank you,* *rv* ------------------------------------------------------------------------ i attached a copy of the flag etiquette code with the parts underlined that deals with the flag touching the ground, flying at half mast and being hung upside down. a little while later i got the following reply: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ *from: dealership_guy* to: redacted_voice* *sent: thursday, july 30, 2009 12:39 pm* *subject: re: flag* *i will rather ignore or no respond to your comment. i am not the wind that blew it off.* *dg* ------------------------------------------------------------------------ to which i replied: ------------------------------------------------------------------------- *from: redacted_voice* *to: dealership_guy* *sent: thursday, july 30, 2009 1:01 pm* *subject: re: flag* *are you the wind who hung it back upside down? not once but at least twice* *this week!!* *if the wind keeps blowing them off please secure so that they can't come loose.* *a piece of wire, a couple of screws or some duct tape should do the trick.* *rv* ------------------------------------------------------------------------ when i didn't get reply and i figured the guy was probably just embarrassed and would go out an fix it right away so no big deal. but on the way home i saw the the flag was still upside down. the next day i stopped on my way home and [took pictures]( being very careful to say on the easement ouside of the business and not to touch the flag as that could be seen as trespassing and possibly get me thrown in jail. over the next couple of days i talked to the local police, emailed the local vfw and american legion. i more or less learned that its within his right to display the flags in whatever manner he wants no matter how offensive it may be. that started me thinking, he may have the right to mistreat the flag and hang it upside down but i have the right to call attention to it as loudly as i can. his website didn't have a comment section or one of those rating meters so that was out. it was hosted on one of those places that lets you set up your own website for free so the closest i could get to his website was to create my own. i created a web page called "dealership guy motors is un-american". i posted the pictures of the flags with a story about what was going on and i set up a counter of the number of days that the flag remained upside down and a daily blog to update the story that went something like: "drove by there this morning, flag still upside down." "drove by this evening, flag still upside down, the other one is at half mast." "3 days and still no reply from dealership guy." then i went to every forum i could think of that was appropriate and posted "dealership_guy motors is un-american" with the story and pictures of the flags. i emailed the local radio stations and tv stations. to top it off i joined a couple of online biker groups and posted in there...those guys love their flag. after waiting a couple of days i did a google search and sure enough all of those posts, my website and a few cross posts popped up at the very top of the search. a search on yahoo gave me the same results. i took screenshots of the search pages and sent them to dealership guy, i included the urls of the google and yahoo search pages and the url of my web page i personalized it with a very sweet *"have a nice day :)"*. after several days of silence and being ignored i got a reply within minutes. i could bore you with a whole tale about implied physical threats and threats of a lawsuit or how the local media came this close to getting involved but to make a long story short he took the flags down completely immediately after i sent him the email. not exactly what i wanted but no flag at all is better than a mistreated one. girl i was with gave me the clap. i found out she was sleeping around on me .as it came out that the clap was going around in my social circle. so we all go get checked and get meds. they all get cured. i'm still pissed that 1 she was sleeping around on me and 2 she gave me the clap! so i don't take my meds for 3 weeks and as expected she comes to me wanting some. so i gave it to her, clap and all. took my meds and laughed my ass off as the clap made its second rounds through my social circle!so i've been browsing this subreddit for maybe an hour or so, and i think it would be beneficial if you could add [picture/s] into your title so i know if there are some. when there are pictures that provide proof/more info, it's very pleasing.so let's start with some backstory. as a recreational hobby, i plant a lot of vegetables in my backyard. probably around 30-40 types of vegetables. my garden/backyard has a lot of space, so i'm sure my neighbor felt justified in taking 3-8 vegetables from my garden each day, since i'd "never noticed." but luckily i have a fancy security system outside and caught him in the act. this bastard was done. instead of confronting him directly, i wanted to see him burn. so i scout out his backyard and decide to fuck around with him. i steal his water hose, grill, basketball goal, potted flowers, outdoor table set, etc. i put them all in my pickup truck while he was out of town one day and drove the fuck off and dumped them into the forest. f that n. mid 90s... story of revenge by one of my closest friends. adam worked in a car-part factory for gm. one of adam's co-workers(let's call him bill) thought it would be funny to give his co-workers ex-lax during a shift. bill goes up to adam and offers a piece of chocolate but adam was operating a machine with both hands. adam said break off a piece and put it in his mouth. the shift goes on. after adam figured out what happened he learned about 4 others in the plant were also pranked. bill didn't think this prank through...he cost co-workers sick time and some of these co-workers had kids and bills to pay without paid sick days. turns out bill was banging a welfare mom(mom b) and living with her at the time but she wasn't reporting that income/room mate. adam was also banging a welfare mom(mom a). adam told mom a what happened. she knew the welfare system well enough to call mom b and pose as someone from the investigation department of social services. mom a basically said that the department is aware of her having someone live there and not reporting the situation to her case worker. the investigator(mom a) said if you come in and discuss this with the department we will not pursue fraudulent action. tl;dr: don't be an asshole with ex-laxback when i was 15, i got a job working at a breakfast restaurant. i didn't really like it compared to my summer job, but i wanted to make money during the school year so my choices are limited. my boss paid me below minimum wage, but the bus boys would get a very small percentage of the waiters's tips. after that, i would usually end up getting paid around $7-8 an hour, but i always felt it was kind of cheesy because the waiters would make at least $150 in tips, and because i knew my boss was quite well off because he drove a nice car, his son drove a nice car, and his daughter that i went to school with, drove a nice car. now the money that would compensate for my wage was called "tip share" and i would pick up the previous day's tip share after each shift. at first, i would always get paid what my tip share was, or rounded to the next dollar. as time went on though, things got more screwy. our boss started pinching pennies where ever he could, and i got yelled at once because i was throwing away still wrapped straws that were still on the table. ok, fine, these straws literally cost less than a penny each and it's more trouble that it's worth to save them, but whatever i did it anyways because i was told to. i then noticed that i would get shorted a few cents on my tip share though. for example, if my tip share was $17.67, i would only get $17.60. this started to bug me for obvious reasons, but i didn't say anything about it. it got worse though. one day, my tip share was something like $23.51, and i only got $23. i then said "my tip share is $23.51" but then the manager giving me my tip share quickly walked out of the room while saying "oh, sorry i don't have 51 cents." after that, even if the tip share was a few cents short, i would stick it to them and make them pay it. the first time i did this to my boss, he made me feel like i was begging for change. this went back and forth until i eventually got sick of it, and quit. i felt so defeated and hopeless. that's when i discovered tripadvisor.com though. for those of you who don't know, trip advisor is a website that is open for anyone to leave a review on a restaurant, attraction, etc. this restaurant i worked for was in the top ten out of 300 restaurant in my city, so you could say it was pretty highly rated. this is where my revenge starts to take shape. i realize that creating an account and posting one bad review with my new account will accomplish nothing. i needed a reputation, or reputations. i created 30 different accounts, and i started to slowly building up reputations. with these 30 different accounts, i made fake reviews, some good, some bad (i only did bad reviews on other places where the general consensus was that they sucked) and it took me a year or two to make everything seem normal, and i varied the amount of reviews each account made. by this time, my boss had actually expanded and had a second restaurant in a different location of the same name. i wrecked havoc on both of them, leaving around 15 1-2 star reviews on each restaurant. after i did this, more 1-2 star reviews started showing up that i didn't even write! the newest restaurant that my boss opened up ended up closing down, and out of curiosity, i went by the restaurant that was still open in a sunday morning. the restaurant was a breakfast place, so sunday morning was the busiest day of the week because everyone would go out to eat after church. it was nearly dead. i counted 4 cars in the parking lot. i don't think i've ever felt more satisfied in my whole life.a few months ago a guy we'll call alex embarrassed me in a club by mocking me and almost punched me for no reason. alex is a connected though guy. another person in this story is harry. harry is an older guy, a known criminal/mobster/.. and a larger than life character. via facebook he posts a lot of stuff about himself and his friends or enemies, he doesn't care what people say about him and he's afraid of no one. recently harry has revealed some embarrassing facts about alex's dad and he was legally threatened because of it, but harry doesn't care and continues to post information about alex's dad. i've created a facebook account and i am threatening harry but i am not saying who i am, however i am leaving bits of information that would suggest i am alex and i am furious at harry that he embarrassed my father. harry replied to me a few times saying things like "i know who you are, if i meet you i'll smack you..". so there it is, i hope alex gets a well deserved beating.to start off, i don't consider revenge a suitable form of action and a more suitable resolution should always be attempted first, if not a few times, but at some point revenge is morally right. or more fun, your choice.. so here's my story. a few years ago in college i managed to get my first internship (for engineering). i wont say where i was hired, but it was a manufacturing plant of a sort. needless to say i was quite green to the field and young, but excited. several interns were hired, but my position was different. while all the other interns were put in the engineering offices, i was put in a small office on the floor with some seasoned supervisors, none of whom where even in my field. {before you read on, please note that i ended my rotation on a great note. i had saved the company thousands more a year than it cost to have me there, implemented a new product procedure, stunned management at my presentations and even left with an informal job offer!} i was essentially thrown to the dogs to learn processes that no one in the plant knew all the steps to and i had 3 days to learn them from the past intern, all while trying to attend mandated tours/meetings/etc [i ended up writing a 12 page paper on how to perform that one duty]. due to all this mess, i managed to get myself put into the engineering office, but i had missed all the "getting to know you" events with the engineers due to my responsibilities getting back on track, my supervisor was a young guy who started as an engineering intern and after graduation went through a fast track program to become the department supervisor. now in comes becky (name changed) my manager had informed me to ignore her requests and has been in obvious confrontations with her, but he out ranked her and for most arguments was typically in the right. she hated him. remember the "responsibilities" i mentioned earlier? well they required me, an intern mind you, to light a fire under the engineer's butts to get them to push paperwork through. this created a mild animosity from the engineering department towards my intern position and me, especially from becky who was notorious to the floor supervisors for not only being a "jerk" but never doing her paperwork. she was also notorious for talking behind peoples backs, etc etc. i was given a new engineering supervisor and when my new desk was placed in her area she immediately assumed that i was there to do her work and that she could make me miserable. during the first few weeks i had no issues helping her out and learning as much as i could, i frequently asked her if she needed help, but then it became abusive... im not sure if it was that i had to pester her to do her job when i had my old "responsibilities" or that i didn't take peoples sh!% when they just wanted to sh!% on someone or that she had a bad relationship with my supervisor who outranked her. either way she started talking behind my back to the other interns when i wasn't there. i was informed that she would get off the phone with me when i was on the floor doing her job and tilt her head back exclaiming out loud how i don't do any work. she would talk down to me and treat me like i was stupid simply because i would ask her how she wanted me to do the tasks she requested. i was given a many tasks that were performed by other interns and were strait forward, but once completed she would yell at me for not doing them how she wanted. i was given many tasks with no instructions or a lack of important details just so she could complain that i was doing things wrong. doing her job wrong. the breaking point was when i had a month left of my rotation. another intern left a month early so that she could secretly start a different internship (she claimed she went to summer school). the desk i was given in the engineering department was so tiny that i had to use spare tables in other rooms to keep all my work in order, so i requested to take the other interns large desk and my supervisor approved. after watching me run around the building after i had clocked out to get all my things on the new desk and have everything set up becky didn't say a word. the next day i came in to an email from her telling me i was out of line to move my things without her consent (mind you she had no authority over me and was one of 20 engineers in the office) and told me to move my things back. i went to my supervisor and asked what the issue was, but becky had already yelled numerous lies about my desk migration and i was forced back to what people had dubbed "the lonely island". that very same day becky had the gull to bring me to her desk and explain she had was in charge of a new product and that i needed to come in 2 hours early for the rest of my rotation to over see its manufacturing and record its data. she stressed it's importance for her and that this was "my" way of making things up to her. i had my opening. i agreed and started coming in early, but "missing" my data points. at first i didn't directly mess up her data but i didnt try very hard either. eventually some of her prototypes got lost in a mess of literally thousands of others due to the floor-men not paying attention, i sure as hell didn't check the logs to find them. then the last week i was there i over heard her hyping up her new product, how great it was and how shes really been "helping batmans_secret learn what engineering really is" and she "took me under her wing" when in reality she hadn't talked to me for weeks. at this point all my data went missing. the backup file was corrupt and after she presented my presentation as her own, she was swiftly taken to the head of engineering's office and much noise ensued. i apologize if this was long and wordy but i still left out many many details of the backhanded things she did to me. another one off the top of my mind is that she invited all the interns except for me to many after work gatherings, and even talked about it in front of me. when i was in senior year of high school, there wasn't much to do in my area. so, me and my indian friend would go play minigolf. it was fun and passed the time. so anyway, one time we were playing and we got to the hole you had to hit a ball up the hill. i hated that hole because you rarely hit it with the right amount of force. so i hit my ball and it starts going up. when it reaches the top of the hill, a freak of nature happens and it somehow goes flying right up in the air. "wha?" immediately i hear behind me an angry "hey!!" i turn around and see a middle age guy stomping towards me from the other side of the course. "what the hell are you doing?! you're gonna hurt somebody" "chill out man, it was an accident" "no, it wasn't. you two are being freaking idiots and are gonna hurt someone" i look over at my friend, a scrawny 5'3 17 yr old kid who couldn't do shit if he tried and me, a 5'8 kid who literally just tapped a minigolf ball up the hill. we looked at each other questioning if this was really happening and if this guy was serious. "you idiots stop messing around and dont hurl your balls in the air" he starts stomping off. "but i didn't mean to" he looks back at me stomping off with rage face. turns out he was just playing with his kid. my friend and i go to the next hole. "hey mc2157, the dudes glaring at you." "just ignore him." we played the hole. next hole i saw he was doing it *again.* i had enough and knew he was fucked if he laid a hand on me, so i waved at him and yelled with a smile "how you doing?" the guy ragefaced in shock. the problem was my friend did that to him everytime we got to a new hole. i told him to stop but i stopped caring. at the second to last hole, rageface finally responded "good!" and stomped back up to us and stood right next to *me* as i putted. i began to purposefully miss my ball and knock it into the wall next to him. "oops!" i did it around 10 times and finally sunk it, when he finally walked away. i looked at my indian friend and told him "alright, the gauntlet is thrown. follow my lead, keep your shades on and no matter what happens don't. fucking. laugh." that friend was a real racist. i stopped hanging out with him because of it but i used it to his advantage. i should mention this was the spring after 9/11. we went to the cashier and talked to the manager. with my most pathetic, soft voice i began to tell her what happened to my friend and i. how the guy approached us and yelled, how he harassed us, and how he targeted my friend. "you know, we come here to have a safe, fun time and this guy...this guy was so racist. he...he called my friend an f'ing arab!" my friends face immediately turned red trying to contain his laughter. i could tell his eyes were bulging behind his shades. "i mean look at him! he's clearly embarrassed and turning red! he's not even arab, he's indian! and he blamed him for 9/11!" the manager looked crushed "boys, i'm gonna talk to him right now, wait here" "no, look we had enough today, we'll come back another time. we don't want him to yell at us anymore." we left the building and i told my friend don't laugh till we got in my car. the split second before he closed his car door, we heard rageface yell "what?!!" and we lost it. we drove off into the sunset. victorious. tldr; dude fucked with my minigolf. i called him racist. hilarity ensued.so i was heading home from university early in the morning after 7:00am summer class (not a nice morning driver). the main road to the university that is normally packed during the school year is under construction which meant 3 lanes became 1 for a good 2 miles (to and from the university). as i head into the merge i see that some chick in a suv was trying to cut me off but i supposedly had the right of way cause the front of my car was in front of hers and i was in the merged lane. this continues for like 1/8 mile because this merge was quite long, and i try to maintain being in front of her, she without warning starts to merge left onto my lane with me there knowing that i was there so i had no choice but to go into the center lane (left turning lane) until this dumb bitch passed me and i could merge back in (i had a smaller car so she would have won the fight). kicker is when i merged back in she flipped me the finger and shit was going to go down because i felt i was being generous to not have our sides fucked up. as we passed the construction and the road went back into 3 lanes she immediately goes back to the middle lane and i gunned it passed her and cut her off as close as possible (as soon as my front tires overtook the front of her car since i was driving faster than her). i then slammed on my brakes all the way to 0 mph, flipped her off. as i felt triumphant, i started to accelerate but wasn't really ready to let her off just yet. she switched lanes again thinking this is over and that civility would restore. wrong! i did it again. now she honks at me and tries to escape by switching lanes again. wrong! third times a charm. now she is probably freaked out, me as well because normally i would leave it at flipping them off as a drove past, freaking blood rush. she pulls into the nearest parking lot on the right and i go on my merry way feeling quite accomplished. again, i acknowledge that i have road rage issues. tl;dr **some chick forces me into the middle (left turning) lane in a construction merge point and has the audacity to flip me off, triple revenge back to back. don't fuck with me on the road.**technically it's not my first revenge, but the first i can remember myself. everyone knows how little kids are amused by the crowd of adults. kids show off, make silly things, etc. it wasn't my case. i was always interested in adults, because of the things they were talking about, which i didn't understand; and what they were able to do, which i couldn't. *** my brother had a group of friends, which occasionally were hanging out in his room. i'd always just wanted to sit and observe. i remember guys touching their girlfriends, kissing, etc. all this behavior i couldn't wrap my head around. another example was one of the guys, who could spin the basketball on his finger. actually i still don't know how to do it. all of this was just amazing, kind of like a different world. *** sometimes, my brother was letting me sit there, and usually they were making fun of me. i was the only one who wasn't laughing, since i didn't know what they are laughing about. they were asking me things like, "pierce, tell us what is vagina." "vagina?", i asked, and they burst out laughing. or they were asking me to tell them a joke, and i was telling them a joke i heard from someone my age and they were just rolling over, not because the joke was any funny, but because of the situation and they way i was telling it. *** one day, my brother brought his friends, and i stand near his room, looking at everyone like a little creep. one of the guys (a musician) brought his new girlfriend. i was in love. i had to get to that room, to be able to stair at her, but they closed the door. i knocked, i asked, i begged. nothing. my brother went to the kitchen to heat up some water and that was my moment. i sneaked in, jumped under the table and settled comfortably. my brother came and started dragging me out, so i hold to a table leg. didn't help. they were smoking cigarettes, that why they didn't want me there. i even didn't care, i just wanted to stare at that girl. unfortunately, the musician couldn't hold on to his girlfriend, so it was the only time i saw her. *** i went to the kitchen, and i poured about 2 cups of salt to the kettle. my brother made coffee for a few people, and soon enough they figured somethings wrong. he went again, warned me that if i do this again, i will regret, cleaned the kettle and started making the water again. a week back, i got prescription from a doctor, because i hadn't pooped for almost a week. none of the over the counter stuff worked, so he prescribed something serious. it sure cleaned my bowel pretty damn good. i spent whole day glued to a toilet. i found the pills, crushed them with [this thing]( (saw my mom using it), and poured to the water again. well, i took 1 pill, and i poured all of them to water, probably 9 left, so imagine for someone without the problem. all 4 people who were drinking coffee, including my brother, next day were dying. their symptoms were, colon blows, runs, flu dump. my brother himself sounded more like a machine gun. *** i hadn't told that to my brother for over 20 years, until yesterday. we had such a blast during the dinner i almost peed. good old times ;-) *** *** tl;dr^(older brother gets punished by providing him and his friends a diarrhea of their life, and he doesn't know about if for over 20 years)well reddit, this all happened a couple of years ago before electricdog quit drinking. well drunk electricdog was quite the fellow. he was rude, crude and a petty revenge kind of guy. one day young electricdog came in to work and was presented some samples of barbecue sauce for the upcoming beerfest at the local event centre. well electricdog popped the first sample into his mouth, and it was a delicious chipotle barbecue sauce. now before i continue, a spry young fellow with a fondness for pranking people and being a general douche had started a few weeks earlier. everyone called him by his last name: spears. electricdog called him britney. electricdog did not like his douche-baggery in the least bit. in fact electricdog was averse to his tomfoolery, that he began to break a little inside each time he was forced into a social situation with britney. anyways enough back-story. the second sample was supposed to be another barbecue sauce, but this one was supposed to be the milder of the two. in fact the cooks, specifically britney, had been concocting this contrivance since the first blush of the sun's rays were reflected off the door to the basement bar he worked in. when electricdog put the sample in his mouth, for a second it tasted quite nice. a spicy barbecue sauce, heavy tones of something all together not unfamiliar to our hero. then the capsaicin spiciness was an old beloved of electricdog, but this was unlike anything our friend had ever experienced. it was flooding his nostrils and tear ducts. his every ounce of being began to ignite with the devils secretion he had just ingested. the entire kitchen as well as the bartender, and britney at the helm of the whole ordeal. the bartender informed our standard-bearer that britney and the rest of the cooks had gotten their hands on some [ghost pepper extract]( and made it into a paste of a sauce that was to be used on drunk people ordering suicide wings. the bartender, hardly able to contain his laughter thrust a 2 litre container of milk into electricdog's hands and so he imbibed the moo juice at an incredible rate, almost finishing the container... then a moment passed.. electricdog was dancing around with flames pouring out of his oral cavity. suddenly the urge to purge came upon our exemplar and he sprinted for the water closet. at first there was relief, but soon after that electricdog realized that the vileness that was within should be kept there and processed, for it scorched the same if not more coming up. so our hero was forced to withhold the contents of his stomach from the almighty porcelain god. but something inside him was broken. something that would eat at him until vengeance had been brought to pass upon the evil britney. weeks passed. electricdog biding his time, until such an event would present itself, where retribution would be swift and deadly. he remembered an old klingon proverb: revenge is a dish best served cold. one day, while sitting at the oaken counter, after consuming just the right amount of grog, britney sat down beside electricdog. electricdog ordered another beer, trying to ignore his most hated of enemies. then something unexpected happened. britney threw a loonie([canadian one dollar coin]( into electricdog's beer, and promptly left his drink unattended at the bar to head to the washroom. electricdog saw his chance. it was time to put up or shut up. he grabbed britney's beer firmly with his left hand, unzipped his fly with his right hand and pulled his cock-and-balls out and swished them around the full container, making sure to get just the right amount of taint juice around the brim of the glass. britney returned from the bathroom and drank his fresh pint of beer, none the wiser. then electricdog exacted his revenge. he waited until britney got up and left the counter, and told the loud mouthed bartender on the other side of the counter what had just transpired. now all electricdog had to do was wait. wait for the story to circulate. a couple of days later britney was on duty and could not even look electricdog in the eye. he knew he had been bested. there would be no more question as to who was the bigger dog. a few days later britney terminated his employ with the bar. edit : tl;dr : got tricked into gobbling a piece of chicken with ghost pepper sauce, so i tea bagged the guys beer while he was in the toilet.i used to work in a small foody type pub, very local. this woman my boss lets call her bitch tits, was horrible and vile to everybody, staff as well as customers. i have never seen so many people walk out that place, she was accually insulting peoples music taste, physical apperence, most of what would not affect their work performance. once some customers asked if there was any ketchup, to which she replied "there's a shop down the road, go buy yourself some!" so i was relieved when i finally got out of that hellhole. i wrote many terrible reveiws, under different accounts, on yelp, trip advisor, google etc. i rallied friends to do the same as well as spreading things by word of mouth. i found out after a year she lost the pub and is living in a shitty flat and working a poundland on minimum wage. karma bitch!it was a super rainy day on 281n as i was driving my '79 saab turbo home. up ahead, there was an overpass and the highway hangs a very sharp left just under the overpass. right on my ass was a white dodge truck with three guys in the front seat. i tried to speed up to get them off of my ass, but they persisted and i couldnt even see their headlights at one point! i know that this sharp turn in the highway was coming up and that there was no way my bald tires could handle the turn with this heavy downpour, so i threw on my right blinker just before hitting the curve and allowed myself just to hydroplane into the far righthand lane. the white dodge was not expecting the sharp turn at his rate of speed and i watched him spinout in my rearview mirror. first into the guardrail, then into the car in the middle lane, then into the car that was behind him. it was like watching a pinball game. i never slowed down, i just kept going. asshole.this story begins with a friend of mine being harassed by one his mutual relations. we were all in high school at the time, my friend, his 'friend', and myself - m'gainer. it was mid summer, around the time when you are at a loss for how to fill the long lazy days. we did the usual stuff, play video games, play pick up sports (ask me about 'batball'), smoke a lot of pot...well one afternoon me and my friend, lets call him jarry, meet up to just chilloot. he starts to tell me about the previous night however and how this 'friend'(from now on known as stew) of his 'fucked up' his car. when he said his car was fucked up, i'm like dood you drove here so obviously it wasn't so bad. but he explained to me that during the previous night a girl he was tryna dig out wanted him to come over and hangout. now, jarry really isn't good with the girls, which is no big dealio to me, but this came as a surprise to him and myself - m'gainer. was he finally gonna get laid? nope. stew let all the air out of his tires and smeared baby food mixed with what apparently 'had to be shit'. it was already after midnight and jarry didn't want to deal with his car, so what was supposed to be just an annoying fuck'ol prank turned into cockblockery. bam. fast-forward to a little later in the day and we've already concocted a brilliant scheme to get stew back. we set out to go fishing. *sorry, to you animal lovers about what happens next*. there is this great little stocked pond close to where we live so we decided to go there. we brought a nice white five gallon bucket and a lid, and some beer....and pot. for some reason, on this particular day, we couldn't miss with our hooks. i'm talkin' every other cast was just jerk n' catch. before long we had 30 small pan fish in our bucket. but we knew what we needed, what would really send this scheme to the pro level. and wouldn't you believe it on our next casts we each got one. two fat n' juicy carp...yeah those dirty brown mud fucker fish. we put those in the bucket too. whoosh. we were off to the store. we grabbed a gallon of milk and a container of meat tenderizer. that night we added the milk and meat tenderizer to the bucket. already at this point, if anyone got a full whiff of the contents of that bucket, they woulda been hair back, eyes out gagging. we covered the bucket and put a couple cinder blocks on top to keep out the local wildlife. but every couple of days for two weeks jarry went out and gave that bucket a good prod n' stir with his pitchfork. after that bucket had been stewing for two weeks we decided it was time to do the deed. we geared up in elbow gloves, black plastic trash bags and makeshift masks to dull the stench. there was no way jarry was bringing that bucket in the car, so i held that heavy bitch out the window all the three miles to stew's house. at 1:30am, in our homemade haz-mat suits we slipped like shadows onto stew's driveway. jarry climbed on top of his car and motioned for the bucket. with a few momentous words he dumped the stewed contents all over the windshield and into the hood. stew had suspicions yes, but he never retaliated against jarry after that. i belong to another forum in which i have spent way too much time on. and it's a website that analyzes and tries to be objective about whether or not ninjas can actually defy the laws of physics and if aikido practitioners can actually fight people (then answer to both is no.) among other hilariously retarded claims made by several martial arts or artists. i'm also the most successful and prolific instigator on the site having caused multiple ruptures in social structure and policy development by generally being as much of a calculated asshole as possible. any member of this site will know who i am. the owner of the site has once said to me in private, "you are the fuckwit that we need, but not the one we deserve." anyway, there was a particularly annoying user who would constantly try to piss on anything i did. i made it a point to be extra mean to him in the worst ways possible. i would go beyond the call of duty to make sure that he would get the full extent of being as flabbergasted as possible. i would use sentences such as, "this is why your mom left you." in response to being called a "faggot" and a "chink." or i'd go into my bag of tricks and do things like send him a private message that had images takes from the mars rovers in full resolution, now this might not mean much but at the time, the forum didn't auto-resize your images so they'd be displayed full bore on your screen. this kid had a shitty computer and so such large images would crash his computer. i figured out a way to get past the signature size limits on images as well, so i would make nasa images my signature on every post to him so he'd crash out. anyway, this back and forth would go on for about 2 years or so until i made my way across the country to formally "train" with him. we did some grappling in which i submitted him in hilariously amusing/humiliating ways. wrist locks, shin chokes, rode him like a cowboy making yee haw noises while he struggled to get out from under me or just calling out my submissions a few moves before i would do them. to be fair he wasn't very good at grappling, as he said. he said he was much better at kick boxing. so he wanted to do that instead. i agreed to the terms and we had 3 - 2 minute rounds. the video is lost somewhere but i have a single still from it wherein i collapse his liver. [here.]( at some point i punch him in the face so hard while sticking him in the corner that his head whips back and hits the camera. i think i also broke his foot at some point. i don't remember exactly when or where but he claims that i did. i'll take it. i left pretty satisfied and he stopped being such a little piece of shit. it was worth travelling 3000 miles and having built up the anticipation of kicking the shit out of him for roughly 2 years. 4 years ago [i quit]( working as a barista for a horribly [drama-filled]( [coffee house]( we'll call super bean. i had a number of [petty wins]( while i was there but this is my only pro revenge. the boss at super bean is a horrible micro-manager. there's a lot to keep track of so smaller things will get tasked to the lowly employees - one being keeping inventory of coffee beans. while the job wasn't the best, the coffee is fantastic. i'd never steal while i was working for the business but once i left that went out the window. my buddy who's still working there has been throwing me about a pound of my favourite coffee every 2 weeks since i left. just a few shy of 100lbs of coffee beans swiped to date.i was a kid, so please don't judge for my actions. as a kid i was a troublemaker. i was everywhere and if something happened, i was the first on the suspect list. either it was making fire in a trash container, tying something to neighbors' dogs, throwing small rocks in neighbors windows at night, stealing fruits from their gardens, putting mud on their cars, and more. i was chased many times by the neighbors, and usually they couldn't catch me, since i knew exactly where i can sneak thru, where they won't. however, my parents were going crazy. the story takes time when i'm 8. i have been hanging out with jack, the son the the current town clerk, in a very small city. the new election was coming up. *you also have to know, that i come from a post-communistic country. as some of you may imagine something like today's russia, predominantly people's values and beliefs about "how the things should be." it's not like in the story any more, but still, my country is in the ice age in some matters.* *** another day, me and jack got caught us on stealing cherries. near our residential block were many small gardens, where most of the people had apple trees, cherries, grapes, etc. many people were making some goodies for the winter. and, everyone knew the best cherry tree in the whole area. we sure knew too. jack was a kind of a chicken, and it took me some persuasion to make him go with me. after all i was running faster ;-) we got caught, and the owner took us to our parents. no one was home at my place, and the owner used to so much to what i was doing, that he just warned me. like 10th time this year. jack on the other had got in some serious trouble. besides beating the hell out of that kid, the town clerk forbidden him to hang out with me, and going outside. i felt it's unfair. imo we didn't do any damage, it was nothing to what i did in the past, he still got punished like it was something big. in the contrast, i didn't have the dessert for what i did. i felt that the responsibility of the revenge rests on my shoulders. *** next day i went to pee on the town clerk's door. while i'm peeing, the door opens, i'm hiding my weenie and sure enough, the town clerk just boils. his mustache were kind of jumping and a huge vein appeared on his forehead. he grabbed my ear before i was able to move. it really hurt. on my toes, i was walking to my apartment. no one is there. we go back to his place, and he told me to sit... in his small toilet... like some animal. i supposed to wait for my parents. i hear the town clerk and his wife arguing. it was first time i saw, that he is probably a monster at home. i closed the door from the inside and i was holding to the lock, so he wasn't able to open that with a screwdriver. i told him i want to wait for my mom. in the meantime, when he was away from the door, i took every single bottle of perfume, etc., tooth paste, etc., which were in the cabinet over the toilet, and i poured everything to the toilet. i was also flushing the toilet every time as it filled up, to piss of mr. clerk. my mom got home and i made myself to cry. i told that mr. clerk wanted to beat me and i was scared etc. all of that to not get in trouble with my mom. she got pissed and took me home. i was crying a long hour, just to not get beaten by my mom. *** now i was even more determined for the revenge. one day i was looking at some photos. there were a few pictures from the vacation with my parents and the town clerk and his wife. on one of the pictures, the clerk was with my father. the town clerk was holding his hand on my dad's stomach and both were laughing, probably drunk as fuck (just fyi they were wearing [these]( which is still normal for straight people in my country lol). i took the picture, and cut out my father's head. found an envelope and got my neighbor friend involved, who was about 5 years older, since i wasn't very good with writing yet. we wrote a letter, which said that, the town clerk is a gay and we attached the "proof." being a gay in post-communistic country could mean literally death. by people who like trouble or even police (believe it or not, that's truth). for sure, it would be extreme comparing to these days. the least, when proven, would be elimination from the society, even family. btw. the short swimming shorts doesn't mean in slavic countries that you're gay... so i went to the post office and i say i want to send the letter to the towns clerk office. there is nothing on the envelope. a very nice lady was laughing at me, since it totally looked like i don't know what i'm doing. she didn't know the address, but she was kind enough to make a call and write it for me on the envelope. she asked me what is my name and being surprised by that question, i gave a name of my friend from school. so now she said, $2 dollars (example). i was like, what? money? i don't have money. and how much? well. now i had to get money somehow. i got home, and asked my mom for money. she asked me why, and i lied i want to send a letter to santa claus. she was surprised by that, but she gave me the money. i run back to the post office... and it's closed. i will have to wait until monday then. *** it was really really hard to not spend this money. but the mission was more important. the letter was sent. i don't know what i was expecting, but probably something like "they will arrest mr. town clerk" and he will spend 10 years in a jail. well, nothing happened, until... *** the town clerk didn't win the new election. a few years later, i heard a story (when he was starting again for a new election) that a few years back someone accused him of some homosexual acts and it bent his reputation. accusation in the office was enough to start the rumor around the small town. since the letter was addressed to the clerk's office, not directly to him, i'm guessing someone opened it before he did. as a kid i didn't really think that sending the letter directly to him would not cause any damage. still, i think it was clever ;) during the new election, some kids sprayed in some places in town, "mr. clerk is gay" (it wasn't me). for everyone it was obvious that the last name was the clerk's name. he won that election however. years after, when i look at it, it really tested his reputation. all the good things he did for the city didn't matter. maybe he was a bad person at home, but people were saying he was a good town clerk. i was never asked about the picture, so i guess he either haven't seen it, which i doubt, or he didn't want to let to know my parents, if he even was able to recognize and remember the time/place the photo was taken. since the incident when he closed me in his restroom, our parents weren't hanging out any more. i saw him occasionally on something which is celebrated as, "namesake." it doesn't exist in the us, in my country it's just another reason to get wasted.when i was 8 years old it snowed in texas for the first time since i was born. i was down the street having fun, enjoying myself when one of these bullies that was about 16, compacted snow into ice and threw it at my face. it hurt like hell, and i started crying since i was so mad. so i went back to my house made a snow ball and peed in it. i used a hat to carry it in (didn't pee in the hat lol). i went back to him and threw it right in his face.i'll give you guys some back story. in graduate school i met my girlfriend neha (not real name). the best way to describe her was she was the sweet innocent indian girl to everyone but she had a really slutty side that she hid from her parents and her indian social circle. when we would start dating she'd tell me that her parents expect her to get married soon, that she could get married to a cardiologist, lawyer etc. she'd talk about how she wouldn't have to work a day in her life. i don't know if she was trying to make me jealous, but i didn't give a shit. funny thing about the whole matter is that these guys usually expected a chaste girl... which neha was the furthest from. when we started dating she told me it was just going to be a fling, but over time i started developing serious feelings for her. i told her and turns out she felt the same. i wasn't a doctor, but i had a good career ahead of myself. i wanted to have a serious relationship and maybe one day marry her. later in our relationship (3 years in), she told me she is going to go to florida with her friends, to party see concerts. as uneasy i felt about this, i did my best not to come off jealous. she promised to text me to make things easier for me and all. and well she told she was going to see tiesto. i was talking to my friends about it, turns out tiesto was in europe. when she came back i started confronting her with the inconsistencies, and she started lying her ass off. though she never admitted to cheating she started doing nice things for me to get me back. at this point i was thinking fuck her, and move on. but i decided to milk it for what it was worth. i used the whole cheating thing to have her on grade a behavior to add to that, i used it to get a threesome. after that i felt much less bitter, but i couldn't ever see myself getting married to a girl that cheated on me. she was a good girlfriend, but i couldn't risk getting divorced to her later down the road and she takes all my money. and since she still never admitted to cheating on me directly, i didn't feel obligated to tell her that i wasn't interested in getting married. by now we were together for 5 years, i was 31 and she was 30. her biological clock was ticking hard. her parents at this point pretty much gave up on her getting married, and her younger sister was already married and popped out her first kid. we got into a big fight one day and in it i yelled at her to admit that she cheated. and she finally did, after all that time. i don't know why, but a huge weight just lifted off my heart, that i had won. and then i told her that we are over. since then she has been begging me to reconsider. for her, reality hit her hard. when it comes to traditional indian marriages, a woman past 25-27 no one is really interested in. and sadly for her, the effects of aging were already getting to her. plus she was planning to lie to her future spouse about her sleeping around so i don't really feel bad for her anyways. it's not that she can't still land a guy; she can still find a decent guy now but the idea of marrying a rich dude that will treat her like a virginal princess is over for her. her life of not having to move a finger is gone now. that's what you get for cheating :) &lt;3 conrad. when i was 13 years old i had my first job in a restaurant and i was so excited because obviously it was my first job! i am 20 years old now and openly gay but then i was obviously very shy and quiet and was quite the pushover. so anyway one night this girl and her boyfriend came in and i had to serve them and any time i spoke to them they kept laughing at me, you know when you're trying not to laugh at something with your friends but you make it really obvious? that's basically how she was treating me all night long making me feel so insecure. so anyway for the first and only time in my life i exacted revenge on her, i had to make her dessert! she had a lovely chocolate brownie with my saliva sticking it to the plate and some ice cream with also my saliva in it. i exacted a little bit of revenge but i didn't really feel like i had done myself justice because her boyfriend and her continued to smirk even after she ate the dessert and i told the manager "i will get revenge on that girl i promise you this". he just laughed and told me to let it go. well the god's most have been looking down on how this girl had treated me with her boyfriend making me feel so insecure in my own skin at 13 because the next day after i had finished rowing me and my friends went into the supermarket right beside it and as i was walking along the tills i saw a familiar face and shouted "no way" at the top of my voice. it was the girl from the night before. she looked up and i've never seen the colour drain from someone's face as quickly as hers. i told my friends all about what happened and they quickly went and grabbed all their food and we went to her till. we all started laughing and just making her feel as uncomfortable as possible. after i paid my money and she gave me my receipt i looked her straight in the eye and said "it's not nice being intimidated in your own work place is it?" and she just hung her head in shame. it was glorious. a few years later, i ended up in a &amp; e last month because i couldn't breathe and the doctors couldn't get an oxygen level. i was sitting in the hospital room waiting for the nurse to come when the curtain was pulled back and i heard a "now.. *my name*". i looked up. it was her. her from the restaurant, her from the supermarket, having to care for me. we both looked at each other like deer caught in the headlight. we knew who we both were but we decided to say nothing. she obviously made her little nurse chit chat like what i did and stuff and she was telling me about my diagnosis but i don't think i've seen a nurse take blood pressure as quickly and throw my medication at me before running for my life. i've had a lot of revenge on people in my life, some obviously not as effective (i had to have counselling because i was bullied so much) but i think this one was the best of the bunch!so, i was always a lard, and i moved from out of the area to this middle school. it was already hella cliquey. these two boys, who were twin brothers, made my life absolute hell. called me every name in the book, tried to start rumors about me, the whole nine. one of them was definitely worse than the other, but they'd assist each other when they deemed it necessary. i had fought back with my own comebacks, but two against one is hardly fair. it wasn't until i had a side job in college that i was able to exact my revenge. i was in college and i worked as a tutor. i had my stoner friend with me, who was baked. we drove around, looking for somewhere that would satisfy his munchies, when i saw a wendy's sitting on the corner. it was a saturday, around 11:30 am, and i rolled up to the window. an all too familiar voice asks with his stupid drawl, "this is wendy's, may ah take ya order?" i figured that this day was as good as any to exact my cosmic justice, and i told him, "yes, i will take 27 orders of $1 chicken nuggets." instant panic took over the kitchen as they were dropping batches and batches of chicken. my former primary bully tried to talk me out of the multiple small orders, but i refused. "this is for a class function," i lied, then continued, "they need to be in individual packaging for all the students." i went up to the window and paid. noon struck while i was sitting there, and all of a sudden- vans started circling the parking lot and getting in line. it was soccer practice day, and all of the kids had just gotten out of their morning scrimmages. i rolled up so that they could try and process the other orders to the best of their ability. the bully himself walked up to my car holding several bags, and stared slack-jawed, realizing what had happened. "thanks," i chirped, as i snagged the massive bags of chicken nuggets, handed them to my stoner friend, and drove off like a bat out of hell. my stoner friend probably ate at least 18 of those things. we gave the rest to this woman that we knew was homeless so that she could have something filling for the evening. it was a great day. whenever my friend and i talk about it, we call it "operation clustercluck". i told this story to my fiancee, who insisted i needed to share this story with other people. this seems a bit involved for the subreddit for petty revenge, so i posted it here.not sure if this is prorevenge or pettyrevenge so i'm posting in both. so i live in an apartment complex with extremely limited parking and no parking on the street for a good half mile. one night, i come home from doing a 12 hour job to discover the parking space closest to my apt is open. as i go to pull in i realize, no, it's not open, some inconsiderate tool has double parked. so i gotta go park in the boonies, i walk back and check his park tag, they usually have the apt number on it, his is faded off. so i've no idea whose ass to kick, i decided to go for the next best thing, i grab a can of spray paint and paint douche across the side of his car in giant letters from window to the bottom of his doors. i ran out of room for the e so it ended up across the windshield. the next morning i woke up and the car was parked proper, lesson learned. added bonus: lesson not learned, i found out who he was later, because i'd see him get up every morning for the next couple of weeks and check on his car to make sure no one messed with it, meaning that he didn't think that someone sprayed his car because he was parked like a douche, but because he thought someone was out to get him. i guess his sleepless nights still make it totally worth it. i am in a graduate program for environmental chemistry and there is a class that all students in the school i am in. i this class, there is a class mate, let's call him zach. let's also call him dr. scrotumchin. he is a doctor because he has mentioned this several times. in fact, every single chance he gets to let someone know he has an md, he says "well i have an md so (yada yada yada)". so in this class we have to present as a group about an assigned topic. of course i was grouped with dr. scrotumchin among other people, mostly girls, who for some reason are all over dr. scrotumchin's chin (if ya know what i mean ;)) we begin talking about our assigned topic which is ocean acidification. dr. scrotumchin automatically takes control of the group. i try to contribute and scrotumchin md will not let anyone get a word in edgewise, well because he has an md for pete's sake! that makes him an expert in oceanography right? well no, you know what does? a phd. in oceanography. to which i am one class away from receiving. i start arguing with dr. scrotes to which he replies, perfectly i might add "it's not like you have an phd in this or something." which i literally do. before i can reply the moderator of the class walks by, aware of the program i am in and says "wait billy (me, not my real name), don't you have one?" scrotumchin's chin along with the rest of his face turn redder than his ass. the group then continues along for some reason treating me as the spokesmen and everyone gets a say in the presentation. except ballsackface, beause he does not know anyhing about ocean acidification. at which he is very upset because he gets a rise out of showing his (for the 100th time) medical knowledge. okay so this story takes place back when i was an innocent 18 year old girl, dating my first "real" boyfriend, who we'll call matt because that was his name. so we'd been dating for almost a year and naive young me was beginning to think this was the real deal (ahh to be young and stupid). however, it was not to be. one day, feeling the urge to be the best girlfriend ever, i baked matt some cookies (m'n'm ones, to be precise), and decided to drive them over to his house in order to surprise him. before i continue, it's important to understand how matt's house was set out. basically, he lived in his parents two-storey house, and they occupied the top level while he got the bottom level with a tv room, bedroom, and bathroom. there were stairs at the front of his house leading to the front door on the second storey, so he had his own personal entrance (a door on the ground level) into his living space. so young me waltzes in with her freshly baked cookies, only to find matt in bed fucking some random girl i'd never seen before. needless to say i was heartbroken. in the moment i could do nothing more than burst into tears and run back out into my car before driving away. in the days that followed i slowly transitioned from hurt to angry, and fairly soon i formulated a plan. so one night, late in the night, me and my closest friend drove to matt's house, quietly parked outside, and with the use of some craft glitter, superglue, and resentment, we carefully enacted out our plan. the next day matt woke up and walked outside to find the word "cheater!" printed neatly in sparkly, glittered letters, superglued to his door, and - as an added bonus courtesy of my friend - repeated on one side of the bmw he had just received from his parents. mutual friends later showed me angry pictures posted by matt on social media, and although the glue ran down the doors in some places it was still clearly legible. fuck you matt! :)x-post from /r/pettyrevenge as i have been called a scumbag for this one (i feel no guilt) ***** rover was a dick and i hated him. we worked together for a year and he talked down to me at every opportunity. whatever. his last day was a friday and he had a large suitcase for all of his acquired crap for his long (train) commute home. one of the engineers walked into my office and invited me to the pub after work, they were going to “kidnap” rover. it turned out they hated him too. **the kidnap** one of the engineers offered to give him a lift to the train station. their car was at the front of a convoy. instead of turning right to the station, they took a left, into the country. rover could clearly be seen to get “animated”. this is petty – even though he was going to miss the last train home, the driver was going to give him a lift half way to catch another appropriate train. too soft, but that was the only way he would agree to the gag. obviously, no-one told rover this. the sun was shining, and we were sitting in the garden of a lovely country pub. this revenge could well have turned into an accidental treat. only it did not. rover would not relax. he got more and more abusive. so much so, his “nice” driver colleague took the large suitcase out of the car and told him to start walking. so he did. the last i ever saw of rover was him dragging his case over the top of a hill in glorious sunshine. good riddance. mods, if this edges too far towards illegal, i'll understand if you remove it, but i think this sub is the perfect place for this tale. about fifteen years ago, i had a buddy with whom i liked to go exploring. abandoned buildings, woods, bridges, construction sites, you name it. we didn't go damage or steal stuff, just looked around. in my neighborhood, there was a long (front-to-back), narrow (facing the street) property, sloping steadily upward from the street. a new buyer uprooted five or six 1960s ramblers from their foundations, moved them in and stood them on stilts (sort of), expecting to build foundations beneath. some vandals wrecked the lower ones, they were hauled away, and the one at the far top/back was left. the property was sold. the houses had been placed on big wooden platforms, held up by several cross-hatched stacks of railroad ties. we had our eyes on exploring the houses, decided to leave the place alone for a while after the vandals hit, then snuck in to check out the one remaining house. the wooden deck stuck out from under it only on the back and the left side; at the back left corner, it was about five feet off the ground. the stairwell in the middle opened to an 8-foot drop. open the front door, and it was more like 10 feet. nice old 1960s home, not much of note but nice to go through, especially considering the weird way it was stood. there were no "no trespassing" signs. we obeyed those; where i live, if you're caught in some such place and there are no signs, all the police can really do is ask you to leave. next door, out by the street, was a tiny house that always had tvs flickering in all the windows, day or night. a few months go by, and my friend found himself homeless. i had nowhere for him to crash, but i stored his stuff for him. he decided he'd quietly move into that abandoned house. arrive late, leave early, stay quiet, and he assumed it'd be fine. he borrowed some old camping gear i had. took the closet doors off their tracks and used them to cover the windows, removed the glass bowl from the ceiling light and hung the camp lantern from it on a bungee cord. and thus, all was well, for a month or two, until someone (had to be the little house next door, neighbors behind couldn't see and neighbor on other side was never home) spotted him and called the police. they arrived, asked him to vacate, helped him move his stuff down to the ground, and said he could return the next night to get it. when we came back, we found most of his stuff gone, and what wasn't gone had been smashed to pieces. the grass up there was very tall and very lush, so you'd really have to know something was there; we could faintly see what looked like a path blazed up to the area from the little house. he was livid-- the police had every right to trespass him, but this was a dick move by the nearby neighbors. we decided to have some fun, and dug into my stash of fireworks. i'm still surprised that everything worked *exactly* as we'd intended, but it did go off without a hitch (one firework didn't go off, but that's not much). we snuck in from the rear, through another yard, set everything up, left the same way, went around the block, hid across the street and waited. first to go were some piccolo petes, a shrill whistle followed by a bang. lights went on in the little house. next, a string of firecrackers. then, some mortar shells-- no firing tube, so they just leapt about 8 feet off the deck and exploded (the grass was green at that time of year, no fire danger). three people came out of the little house, just in time to see the mortar shells. of course, one's first thought isn't "elaborate time-delay firing" - when they saw a window on the left side glowing, we were pretty sure they believed the squatter was back and shooting fireworks! they got flashlights and trudged up the hill. we had placed cigarettes on the fuses, cut to various lengths; they kept burning until they reached the fuses; we'd come up with this on the former 4th of july to throw together a short show. we watched them haul themselves onto the deck at back left, saw their lights appear in the picture window at far right as they entered the dining room behind, and watched the lights appear in the front bedrooms. the window on the side, a frosted one, was a bathroom-- between the toilet (just beneath the window) and the bathtub was a little wall with a towel rail, onto which we'd glued a row of candles. the glow went out, and they left the house, surely knowing that they'd just wasted time and effort going after a guy who'd arranged a bunch of stuff in order to make them do exactly that. it wasn't long after that the final blow fell. on a fencepost along the back of the property, i'd placed a big, single-shot white chrysanthemum mortar with a full cigarette on it. i'd hoped they wouldn't notice it as they went in or came back out (the firing tube was white) and they didn't. it went off just as they were regrouping and lit up the house and yard for a few moments, i'd guess as bright as daylight. we were pretty sure the message of, "you've been had," was crystal-clear. a week or so later, we snuck in through the back and left a two-foot roll of firecrackers on the deck, with a full cigarette. fur those who don't know, if you light a firecracker string that's been rolled, they set each other off and the result is a solid blast of noise! we'd unrolled about a foot of it, so they got about five seconds of machine-gun firecrackers followed by a deafening shhhhhhh!!! at their house, about 80 feet away, it must have been a real shocker! after that, we left the matter, and the abandoned house was razed a few months later.ok so to start off i was in the military for about 10 years and after you are done with basic training and your tech school you get you orders to your first base. well when you are fresh out of basic and tech and not married you have to live in the dormitories on the base. this happened around 1999 when you had to share your dorm room with a roommate and also share the toilet and shower with the the two people in the room next to yours. i had the luck of having this little macho asshole as a pissmate ( that's what we called the people you shared the bathroom with). he would brag constantly about all the girls he had slept with and even had what he called a "victim" book with x-rated pics of all the girls he'd slept with. in all honesty this was none of my business until about a year later he was trying to get in the pants of a girl that i happened to be very good friends with. she was an extremely nice girl and wanted nothing to do with one night stands. i very politely warned her to watch out for this guy because that's all he wanted out of her. about a week later on a saturday morning this idiot storms into my room while i'm still asleep and proceeds to attack me in my bed because my female friend turned down going out with him because of what i told her. now he continued the whole time to try and punch and kick me while i'm still half asleep in bed. i finally wake up enough to realize what's going on and throw the little prick across the room. he starts to curse at me and tell me i better watch my back and keep my mouth shut. so now i'm up and i'm thinking what kind of pussy attacks a dude while he is defenseless sleeping in bed? i decide i should get up and get done. i go jump in the shower (remember we all have to share the shower) and i see his slightly expensive shampoo sitting on the tub and a very gross idea for revenge pops into my head. i decide to unscrew the cap to his shampoo and proceed to jerk off into it. i shake it up pretty good as to mix up. so to cut it short i made sure to compliment him on how nice and shiny his hair was and how his shampoo must have a lot of protein in it every time i saw him after that.when me and my friends were like 12y old, we lived in a peaceful and nice neighbourhood. all other people were nice except one old couple. they were fed up with life and children. we did skating and hanging at a bus stop near their house. we were well behaving and not too loud kids but still they didn't like us. they started to call police saying we were destroying things etc. the 2nd time even the police were fed up with the wrong alarms. one day they had broken beer bottles on the bus stop and said we did it. we were too young (back then 12y olds didn't drink) to have drank those and we happened to notice that there were similar empty beer bottles on their yard. they also had their adult son to drive our skating curbs away (another friend saw this). we had had enough. we started to broke bottles on their yard, shot bb pellets on windows, blew up their post box many etc. in the beginning it was quite frequent but of course fading as time went by. still every now and then they got their post box blown up. we actually gave them quite a lot more than they were asking. but the thing is that they did ask for it, they didn't need to be assholes. in the beginning they didn't state a reason for hating us, so today i don't know why they started it. tldr: old couple started to fuck with us and we gave them overly back.this is long, but i think a little back story is important. i went to a small, private, liberal arts, all-women’s college. we lived in a bubble – picture classes where most every sentence that comes out of someone’s mouth starts with the two words “i feel…” so we had residence coordinators, who were generally students who had graduated the year previous and were – in exchange for free housing, free classes, and a small spending stipend – housed with the students to keep order, help in emergencies, run house meetings, wipe noses, etc. etc. better than the traditional “house mom,” but not by much. in the bigger houses on campus, there were triples on the first floor for first years. my girlfriend and i managed to get it as a double her second year (thus freeing up two singles), so we had a living room, bathroom, and bedroom to ourselves – essentially our own 700sqft apartment in a dorm house. and our living room wall was up against the rc’s living room wall. this wouldn’t have been a big deal, if not for a few fun facts about our rc that year: * she was finishing up classes required for her master’s degree program and was constantly studying * she was very noise sensitive * she was a petty little bitch fun facts about me and my girlfriend: * we never had classes before lunch because we were both night owls * we always had a lot of friends over, and parties every weekend * we had two cats, one of which (hers) was a siamese that never shut up, and a dog. same as most any other college, pets were not allowed. the dog was co-owned with another friend so it sometimes lived with us, and sometimes lived off-campus. needless to say, our pets were the worst kept secrets on campus. my cat and the dog were brought to my tennis matches – on leash and harness of course – as well as rugby matches, and walked around campus daily. so she knew we had the pets – but it wasn't until we annoyed her one too many times that she decided to make it her life’s mission to prove we had the pets (thus getting us fined $150/pet per month until pets were gone). thanks to the fact it was a very liberal liberal arts college, she could not just do a random room inspection – she had to give us 24 hours notice, which gave us plenty of time to get the animals out of the room (though one time we forgot, and ended up hiding both cats in the window seats in the hallway between the living room and bedroom – litter box was hidden in our bedroom closet – we refused to turn the music down because the siamese wouldn’t shut up the whole time he was in there). after about 10 room inspections in a month, i was fed up. she was being petty because we were "noisy," and though we did try to keep it down late at night, we annoyed her no matter what time of day it was. edit for clarity: she was that girl in the dorm who told everyone to shut up she's studying. someone walking down the fucking hall "too loud" got bitched at by her. and she had a complete other room to study in that wasn't sharing a wall with us, so i had no sympathy. she complained to the girl above her that she was "stomping around constantly" and the girl - who was very sensitive about her weight - ended up moving out of our house very upset. she wrote up 90% of our house for noise violations, that is why we wanted to get her to quit. so i decided i would prank her until she quit. or cried. or quit, while crying. she had a car and a reserved parking spot right behind the house, next to the handicap spot. so one weekend i borrowed my dad’s truck (rwd to tow a boat), and too damn early for a monday morning backed up to her bumper (it was a jetta) until just touching, and slowly pushed her car into the handicap spot. she only used her car on the weekend, so chances were she wouldn’t notice the car was moved until it was too late. monday she received a parking ticket ($15) tuesday she received a parking ticket ($15). wednesday, she received a parking ticket ($15). thing is, after three tickets, your car is booted. thursday, her car was booted ($35). at this point, public safety called her and told her to get her car out of the fucking handicap spot. i was walking down the hall past her room and the door was open that evening, and she was talking to some other housemates, insisting “i swear i put the parking brake on! i don’t know how it ended up in that spot!” one look from me and everyone knew who was responsible. and that was just the beginning of months of horrible &amp; petty pranks i pulled on that poor woman in my quest to get her to quit.
